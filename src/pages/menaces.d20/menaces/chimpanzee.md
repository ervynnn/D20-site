The statistics below represent a chimpanzee, but they can also be used for any
ape or monkey of similar size, such as a howler monkey. Most such animals are
omnivorous, although some can be quite fierce and aggressive.

###  Species Traits

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the chimpanzee must hit a single
opponent that is its own size category or smaller with both slam attacks in
the same round. During any round that it grapples such a creature, the
chimpanzee may make one additional grapple check as a free action at its
highest attack bonus. On a successful hit with such an attack, it
automatically deals bite and slam damage to its foe.

Bonus Feat: A chimpanzee gains Weapon Finesse (slam) as a bonus feat.

Skill Bonuses: A chimpanzee gains a +8 species bonus on Climb checks and a +4
species bonus on Jump checks.
