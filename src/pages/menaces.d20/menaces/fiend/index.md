##  Fiend

Fiends appear in countless forms, although their physical characteristics
often reflect some sin or other vile aspect.

Species Traits

Fiends share the following traits:

Darkvision (Ex): Fiends have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. Darkvision
is black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and a fiend
can function with no light at all.

Allegiances: All fiends have a primary allegiance to evil. Fiends may also
have an allegiance to either chaos or law.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Fiends receive either Archaic Weapons
Proficiency or Simple Weapons Proficiency as a bonus feat. They are proficient
with their natural weapons and any weapon mentioned in their entries. Fiends
noted for wearing armor gain the bonus feat Armor Proficiency with whatever
type of armor they are accustomed to wearing (light, medium, heavy), as well
as all lighter types.

Languages: Fiends can speak Abyssal (the language of demons) and a number of
additional languages equal to their Intelligence bonus. Fiends with an
Intelligence of 8 or higher can also read and write these languages.

Special: Fiends cannot be raised from the dead.
