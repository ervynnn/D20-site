##  Jumping Jack (Blood Fiend)

Breath Weapon (Su): Once every 1d4 rounds, the jumping jack can breathe a
15-foot cone of fire. Each creature in the area takes 2d6 points of fire
damage; a successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the jumping jackâ€™s Hit Dice +
its Constitution modifier) halves the damage.

Damage Reduction 10/Silver (Su): A jumping jack ignores the first 10 points of
damage dealt by any unsilvered weapon.

Immunities (Ex): The jumping jack is immune to fire and poison.

Prodigious Leap (Ex): The jumping jack can ignore the 20-foot move requirement
for making long and high jumps. If it does move 20 feet before attempting a
jump, the distance jumped is doubled.
