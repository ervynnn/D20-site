###  Species Traits

Elemental: Zaps have the traits and immunities common to elementals.

Electricity Immunity (Ex): A zap is immune to electricity damage.

Shock Touch (Ex): With a successful melee touch attack, a zap deals 1 point of
electricity damage.

Short Circuit (Su): At will as an attack action, a zap can cause an electrical
overload in a piece of electronic equipment within 10 feet, destroying its
internal workings and rendering it useless. If the item is being carried or
wielded at the time of the attack, the wielder can attempt a Reflex save (DC
20) to negate the effect. An unattended item receives no save. An electronic
item damaged in this fashion must either be replaced or repaired (Repair DC
15).
