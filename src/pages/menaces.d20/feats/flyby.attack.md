title: Flyby Attack
layout: '~/layouts/MarkdownLayout.astro'
---
The creature can attack on the wing.

Prerequisite: Fly speed.

Benefit: When flying, the creature can take a move action (including a dive)
and another partial action at any point during the move. The creature cannot
take a second move action during a round when it makes a flyby attack.

Normal: Without this feat, a creature can take a partial action either before
or after its move.
