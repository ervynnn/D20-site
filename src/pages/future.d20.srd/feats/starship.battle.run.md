## Starship Battle Run

You are skilled at starship skirmish tactics, zipping in and out of an enemy’s
sights.

Prerequisite: Dexterity 13, Starship Dodge, Starship Mobility.

Benefit: When using an attack action with a starship ranged weapon, you can
move both before and after the attack, provided that the total distance moved
does not exceed the starship’s tactical speed.

Moving in this way does not provoke an attack of opportunity from the defender
you are attacking (though it can provoke attacks of opportunity from other
nearby starships, as normal).
