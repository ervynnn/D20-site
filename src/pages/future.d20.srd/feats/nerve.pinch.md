## Nerve Pinch

You can incapacitate foes with a vicelike pinch.

Prerequisites: Combat Martial Arts, base attack bonus +4.

Benefit: You make an unarmed attack against a living creature. If the attack
succeeds, the target takes no damage but must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC
10 + one-half your character level + your Strength modifier) or be paralyzed
for 1d4+1 rounds. If the targetâ€™s attack of opportunity hits you and deals
damage, the nerve pinch automatically fails.

Special: This ability does not work on creatures without nervous systems or
discernible anatomies, such as oozes and plants.
