## Jack Of All Trades

You’ve picked up a smattering of even the most obscure skills.

Prerequisite: Character level 8th+.

Benefit: You can use any skill untrained, even those that normally require
training and those that are exclusive to classes you don’t have. You cannot,
however, gain ranks in a skill unless you are allowed to select it.
