You can use a starship’s ranged weapon set on automatic fire to affect a wider
area than normal.

Prerequisite: Starship Gunnery.

Benefit: When using a starship’s ranged weapon on autofire, you can affect an
area four 500-foot squares long and one 500-foot square wide (that is, any
four 500-foot squares in a straight line).

Normal: A starship weapon on autofire normally affects a 1,000-foot-
by-1,000-foot area.
