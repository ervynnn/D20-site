You can hurl your mecha’s body onto opponents to deal tremendous damage.

Prerequisite: Mecha Operation.

Benefit: As an attack action, you can maneuver your mecha to jump or fall onto
opponents, using the mecha’s body to crush them. This attack is useful only
against creatures at least two size categories smaller than your mecha. The
base damage for a crush attack depends on your mecha’s size category, as given
below. Add 1.5 times your mecha-modified Strength bonus to this base damage to
determine the total damage for the attack.


<table> <tr><th>Mecha Size</th><th>Damage</th></tr> <tr><td>Large</td><td>2d6</td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td>Huge</td><td>2d8</td></tr> <tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>4d6</td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td>Colossal</td><td>4d8</td></tr> </table>



A crush attack deals bludgeoning damage and affects as many creatures as can
fit under your mecha’s body. Each creature in the affected area must succeed
on a Reflex save (DC 10 + your mecha’s size modifier for grapple attacks). On
a failure, the creature is pinned and automatically takes crush damage each
round the pin is maintained.
