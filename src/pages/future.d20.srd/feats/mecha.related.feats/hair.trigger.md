## Hair Trigger

You have developed a delicate sense of timing, and your area attacks hit your
foes when theyâ€™re ill-prepared to defend against them.

Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +6.

Benefit: Whenever you make an attack from your mecha that requires enemies to
make Reflex saving throws, the DC for such saves is increased by +2.
