## Mecha Weapon Proficiency

You know how to acquire targets and fire your mecha’s weapons using onboard
computers and sensors.

Prerequisite: Mecha Operation.

Benefit: You no longer suffer the standard penalties on attack rolls while
you’re in your mecha. You can use any feats that refer to firearms with your
ranged mecha weapons.

Normal: Characters without this feat take a –4 penalty on attack rolls made
while in a mecha cockpit. Furthermore, they cannot apply firearm feats to a
mecha’s ranged weapons.
