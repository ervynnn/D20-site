You are adept at creating mastercraft electronic and mechanical devices
(including tools, vehicles, weapons, robot manipulators, and armor).

Prerequisites: Craft (electrical) 8 ranks, Craft (mechanical) 8 ranks.

Benefit: When successfully completed, a mastercraft electronic or mechanical
object provides an equipment bonus on skill checks made to use the object (in
the case of mastercraft vehicles, this includes Drive or Pilot checks). A
mastercraft weapon provides a bonus on attack or damage rolls (your choice). A
mastercraft suit of armor improves the armor’s equipment bonus to Defense. In
each case, the bonus can be +1, +2, or +3, and no single object can have more
than one mastercraft feature. (For instance, you cannot build a mastercraft
weapon that gains a bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls.)

On average, it takes twice as long to build a mastercraft object as it does to
build an ordinary object of the same type. The cost to build a mastercraft
object is equal to the purchase DC for the object (or its components) + the
bonus provided by the mastercraft feature (+1, +2, or +3).

In addition to the Wealth check, you must also pay a cost in experience points
equal to 250 × the bonus provided by the mastercraft feature. The experience
points must be paid before making the Craft check. If the expenditure of these
experience points would drop you below the minimum needed for your current
level, then the experience points can’t be paid and you can’t make the
mastercraft object until you have sufficient experience points to remain at
your current level after the expenditure is made.

Apply the following modifiers to the Craft check DC for mastercraft items:


<table> <tr><th>Mastercraft Feature</th><th>DC Modifier</th></tr> <tr><td>Mastercraft (+1)</td><td>+3</td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td>Mastercraft (+2)</td><td>+5</td></tr> <tr><td>Mastercraft (+3)</td><td>+10</td></tr> </table>



You can add the mastercraft feature to an existing ordinary object or a lower-
grade mastercraft object by making a Wealth check and then making the Craft
check as though you were constructing the object from scratch.
