title: Luminous Skin
layout: '~/layouts/MarkdownLayout.astro'
---
Special skin grafts create luminous displays on the recipient’s flesh. Most
recipients use it purely for decoration, but the same technology can provide a
built-in chronometer.

Benefit: The recipient can control the brightness of the luminescence as a
free action, negating it entirely if desired. As its most intense, luminous
skin can illuminate squares occupied by or adjacent to the recipient. The
chronometer serves the same function as a wristwatch, including date, time,
and alarm functions.

Type: Internal.

Hardness/Hit Points: –/– (luminous skin ceases to function when the recipient
is killed).

Base Purchase DC: 4 (6 for chronometer version).

Restriction: None.
