## Laser Optics (PL 7)

The recipient’s eyes are replaced with ocular implants capable of firing thin
laser beams.

Benefit: Using laser optics is an attack action that does not provoke attacks
of opportunity. A “laser eye” deals 2d6 points of fire damage, threatens a
critical hit on a natural 20, and has a range increment of 20 feet. Each
additional eye adds +2 to the damage roll (thus, a pair of laser eyes would
deal 2d6+2 points of fire damage).

A creature equipped with multiple laser eyes must fire them simultaneously at
the same target.

Type: Internal.

Hardness/Hit Points: –/2 (per eye).

Base Purchase DC: Single 25, pair 28.

Restriction: Military (+3).
