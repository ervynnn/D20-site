The recipient has a miniature computer attached to his nervous system, usually
at the base of the skull.

Benefit: The recipient may attempt Computer Use checks as a move action,
rather than a full-round action. The microcomputer reduces by half the time
required to operate remotes. A data port in the back of the unit allows for
the insertion of a standard interface cable (purchase DC 5), allowing the
recipient to transfer data without the benefit of a modem.

Type: Internal.

Hardness/Hit Points: –/4.

Base Purchase DC: 35 (36 with integrated cellular modem).

Restriction: Restricted (+2).
