Two kinds of cybernetic attachments exist: replacements and enhancements.

Replacements: Replacements are prosthetic or artificial units intended to
replace lost limbs and damaged organs. Common replacements provide no benefits
other than duplicating the essential functions of their biological
counterparts, and they present little strain on the beneficiary’s overall
well-being. In appearance, a cybernetic replacement can be recognizably
artificial or virtually indistinguishable from the real thing.

Enhancements: Enhancements bestow new abilities or improve the recipient in
some fashion. Enhancements include skeletal reinforcement, subcutaneous
communications hardware, and weapon mounts. Some enhancements have visible
external components, while others are hidden beneath the skin. Enhancements
put more of a drain on the body’s resources, and recipients frequently suffer
debilitating physical or mental side effects.

### Construction and Repair

Cybernetic attachments are complex instruments with both electrical and
mechanical components. Consequently, a character must have the Craft
Cybernetics feat to build a cybernetic attachment.

Repairing a damaged or nonfunctional cybernetic attachment requires 10 hours
of work and a successful Repair check (DC 25). A character needs both an
electrical tool kit and a mechanical tool kit to facilitate repairs. Without
one or the another, a character takes a –4 penalty on the check; without both
kits, the penalty increases to –8.

### Installation and Removal

Installing or removing a cybernetic attachment, regardless of whether it’s a
replacement or enhancement, requires a successful Treat Injury check. A
character with the Cybernetic Surgery feat suffers no penalty on the check.

Removing a cybernetic attachment without proper surgery causes lasting
physical trauma to the patient’s body, dealing 1d4 points of permanent
Constitution drain.

### Number of Attachments

Only living creatures can have cybernetic attachments. In addition, a living
creature can have a maximum number of cybernetic attachments equal to 1 + the
creature’s Constitution modifier (minimum 0).

A creature may have more cybernetic attachments installed on its body can it
can bear. However, the creature gains 1 negative level per cybernetic
attachment that exceeds its maximum allowed. For each negative level, the
creature takes a –1 penalty on all skill checks and ability checks, attack
rolls, and saving throws, and loses one effective level or Hit Die whenever
level is used in a die roll or calculation. Further, a character with psionic
powers loses the ability to manifest one power of the highest level she can
manifest (player’s choice), while a character with spellcasting ability loses
the ability to cast one spell of the highest level he can cast. This loss
persists until the negative level is removed.

Negative levels caused by having too many cybernetic attachments remain until
the offending attachments are removed.

### Benefits and Drawbacks

Cybernetic attachments provide countless benefits to their recipients. For
example, cybernetic eyes can bestow darkvision, improve the accuracy of the
recipient’s ranged attacks, or emit pencil-thin laser beams. A cybernetic
brain implant can improve the recipient’s response time in a crisis, protect
against mind-influencing attacks, or increase the flow of adrenaline
throughout the body. The possibilities of cybernetic technology are endless.
Although the benefits make cybernetics very alluring, the drawbacks are
equally discouraging:

### Electricity Vulnerability

A creature with one or more cybernetic attachments takes 50% more damage from
any attack that deals electricity damage. This vulnerability to electricity
can be offset by an anti-shock implant (see Cybernetic Enhancements, below).

### Negative Levels

Whenever a creature exceeds its maximum number of cybernetic attachments, it
gains negative levels until the excess attachments are removed (see Number of
Attachments, above).

### Susceptability to Attack

External cybernetic attachments are subject to attacks as if they were objects
worn by their recipients.

### Massive Damage Effects

Massive damage wreaks havoc with cybernetic attachments. Whenever a creature
with cybernetic attachments fails a Fortitude save against massive damage, the
GM should roll percentile dice and consult Table: Massive Damage Effects to
determine what happens.


<table> <tr><th colspan="2">Table: Massive Damage Effects</th></tr> <tr><th>d% Roll</th><th>Effect of Failed Fortitude Save</th></tr> <tr><td>01–30</td><td>Normal Effect</td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td>31–60</td><td>Attachment Disabled</td></tr> <tr><td>61–80</td><td>Normal Effect and Attachment Disabled</td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td>81–100</td><td>Attachment Damaged and Side Effect</td></tr> </table>



Normal Effect: The character immediately drops to –1 hit points and is dying.

Attachment Disabled: One cybernetic attachment (determined randomly or chosen
by the GM) ceases to function until repaired (see Construction and Repair,
above). The character suffers the effects of the disability—as noted in the
description of the cybernetic attachment— for as long as the attachment
remains disabled.

Attachment Damaged: One cybernetic attachment (determined randomly or chosen
by the GM) continues to function but develops an unpleasant side effect that
persists until the attachment is repaired (see Construction and Repair,
above).

Side Effect: The character suffers a debilitating side effect as the result of
a damaged attachment. Various side effects are presented on Table: Side
Effects.
