## Replacements

The most basic replacement limbs and organs don’t bestow any special benefits,
but they suffer the usual drawbacks (see Benefits and Drawbacks, above). Some
replacements of higher PL are built to counter certain drawbacks, as noted.
They don’t add measurably to the recipient’s weight.

Each replacement description includes the following information:

Benefit: What the cybernetic replacement allows its recipient to do.

Type: Replacements can be external or internal. External replacements are
subject to sunder attacks; internal replacements are not.

Hardness/Hit Points: The hardness and hit points of the replacement. Internal
replacements don’t have hardness.

Base Purchase DC: The purchase DC of the replacement (or the components to
build it), at its specified Progress Level. Cybernetic attachments are cheaper
to buy at higher Progress Levels; for each raised step in Progress Level,
reduce the purchase DC by 2.

Restriction: The level of license required to purchase the replacement
legally, and an appropriate black market purchase DC modifier.
