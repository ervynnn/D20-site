## Gazing Eye [MAJOR]

You grow an extra eye in the middle of your forehead. In addition to improving
your visual acuity, the “weird eye” gives you a special gaze attack that makes
other creatures tremble.

MP Cost: 4.

Benefits: The extra eye grants a +2 mutation bonus on Search and Spot checks.

As a free action, you can use the extra eye to make a special gaze attack
against one creature within 20 feet. The creature must succeed on a Will save
(DC 10 + one-half your level + your Charisma modifier) or be shaken for 2d6
rounds. This gaze attack is a mind-affecting compulsion, and any creature that
successfully saves against your gaze attack cannot be affected again for 24
hours. The gazing eye has no effect on other creatures with gazing eyes.
