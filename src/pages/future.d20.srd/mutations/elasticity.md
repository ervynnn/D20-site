##  Elasticity [MAJOR]

You can bend and twist your body in unnatural ways and squeeze through very
tight spaces.

MP Cost: 4.

Benefit: You gain a +10 mutation bonus on Escape Artist checks. Moreover, you
can squeeze through an opening or passage one-tenth as wide and tall as your
height, in inches. A creature using this mutation to move through a tight
space moves at one-quarter normal speed.
