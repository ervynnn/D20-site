##  Venomous Bite [MAJOR]

Your natural bite attack injects poison into your victimâ€™s bloodstream.

MP Cost: 4.

Benefit: Any creature you successfully hit with your bite attack must make a
successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + one-half your level + your Constitution
modifier) to negate the effects (initial and secondary damage 1d4 Con).

Special: You must have a natural bite attack to gain the benefit of this
mutation. You cannot take this mutation if you have the Acidic Saliva
mutation.
