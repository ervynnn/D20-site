##  X-Ray Vision [MAJOR]

You can see into and through solid matter.

MP Cost: 6.

Benefit: X-ray vision allows you to see through 1 foot of brick or stone, 1
inch of metal or composite alloy, and up to 3 feet of wood, plaster, or dirt.
Thicker substances or a thin sheet of lead blocks your vision. X-ray vision
has a maximum range of 20 feet and allows you to see as if you were looking at
something in normal light, even if there is no illumination.
