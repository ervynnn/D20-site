##  Telepathy [MAJOR]

You gain limited telepathic ability.

MP Cost: 5.

Benefit: As a free action, you can forge a telepathic link with another living
creature within 100 feet of you. The creature with which you form the link
must have an Intelligence score of 6 or higher, and it must be a willing
participant in the link. You can communicate telepathically through the link
even if you do not share a common language, but no special control or
influence is established as a result of the link. If you and the linked
creature move more than 100 feet apart, the telepathic link severs instantly.
You can telepathically link with only one creature at a time during any given
round, but the ability can be used at will.
