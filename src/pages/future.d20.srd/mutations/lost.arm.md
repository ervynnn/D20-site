## Lost Arm [DRAWBACK]

One of your arms withers or gets eaten away, leaving behind a stump.

MP Value: 3.

Drawback: You lose one arm of your choice. You cannot effectively wield
weapons that require two hands. In addition, you take a â€“2 penalty on Climb
checks, Swim checks, and grapple checks.

Special: You can replace your lost arm with a cybernetic replacement arm,
assuming such technology is available and you can afford it.
