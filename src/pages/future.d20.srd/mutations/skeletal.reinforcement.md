Your bones become more resilient, allowing you withstand greater amounts of
punishment.

MP Cost: 5.

Benefits: Your massive damage threshold increases by +3. In addition, the
damage you take from a fall is reduced by one die.

Special: This mutation stacks with the Improved Damage Threshold feat. You
cannot take this mutation if you have the Brittle Bones drawback.
