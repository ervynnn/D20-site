##  Claws [MINOR]

Your hands mutate into sharp claws.

MP Cost: 1.

Benefit: You gain a single claw attack that deals slashing damage dependent on
your size: Small 1d4, Medium-size 1d6, Large 1d8. If you get multiple attacks
in a round, you can strike with multiple claws. Your claws are treated as
natural weapons and do not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Having claws does not adversely affect your manual dexterity.
