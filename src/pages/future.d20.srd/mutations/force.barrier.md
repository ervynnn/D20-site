title: Force Barrier
layout: '~/layouts/MarkdownLayout.astro'
---
You can generate an electromagnetic force field around yourself to deflect or
absorb incoming attacks.

MP Cost: 3.

Benefit: As a free action, you can generate an invisible electromagnetic
barrier around yourself that provides damage reduction 3/– against incoming
weapon attacks and force effects. The barrier lasts a number of rounds equal
to your current Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). You can create the
force field three times per day.

Special: Portable electronic devices such as cell phones, sensor comps, and
headsets temporarily cease to function if held or worn by you while the
electromagnetic force barrier is in effect.
