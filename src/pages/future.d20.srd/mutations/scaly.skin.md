title: Scaly Skin
layout: '~/layouts/MarkdownLayout.astro'
---
Your flesh becomes thicker and less porous, giving rise to a thin layer of
scales covering your flesh. The scales are typically smooth and dry, like
those of a snake, and can vary in color and pattern. The scales may not cover
your entire body, instead appearing in patches on your face, neck, torso, and
limbs.
