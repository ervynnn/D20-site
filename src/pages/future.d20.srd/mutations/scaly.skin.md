##  Scaly Skin [COSMETIC]

Your flesh becomes thicker and less porous, giving rise to a thin layer of
scales covering your flesh. The scales are typically smooth and dry, like
those of a snake, and can vary in color and pattern. The scales may not cover
your entire body, instead appearing in patches on your face, neck, torso, and
limbs.

MP Cost: 0.

Benefit: None.

Special: A creature with fur, scales, or chitin cannot gain this mutation.
