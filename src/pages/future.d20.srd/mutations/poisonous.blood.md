title: Poisonous Blood

Your blood is poisonous to your own body. You must take regular doses of
antitox to resist the poison’s effects.

MP Value: 6.

Drawback: If you go 24 hours without taking a dose of antitox you must make a
successful Fortitude save (DC 15) or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage.
Taking a dose of antitox cures the ability damage caused by antitox
deprivation in 1d6 rounds. Ability damage caused by antitox deprivation cannot
be restored through natural healing.

Special: This drawback can be taken only in Progress Level 6 or higher
campaigns (when antitox is available).
