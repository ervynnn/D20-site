##  Enlarged Form [MAJOR]

You grow, becoming an freakishly large specimen of your kind.

MP Cost: 6.

Benefits: You become as large as your size category allows (8 feet tall for
Medium-size characters, 4 feet tall for Small characters). However, you
function in many ways as if you were one size category larger. Whenever you
are subject to a size modifier or special size modifier for an opposed check
(such as during grapple checks, bull rush attempts, and trip attempts), you
are treated as one size larger when it is advantageous to you. You are also
considered to be one size larger when determining whether special attacks
based on size (such as improved grab or swallow whole) can affect you. You can
use weapons designed for a creature one size larger without penalty (for
example, a Medium-size character with this mutation can wield a Large weapon
one-handed).

This mutation does not change your face or reach.
