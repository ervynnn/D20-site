##  Unnatural Skin [COSMETIC]

The color of your skin or exoskeleton changes drastically, assuming a hue or
texture that is both unnatural and atypical of your species. Your skin might
be a single color, splotched, or patterned in some freakishly unnatural way.
Your skin might gain dynamic pigments that change color based on outside
stimuli, such as exposure to ultraviolet light.
