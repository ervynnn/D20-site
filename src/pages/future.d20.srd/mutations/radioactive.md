You are immune to some radiation and can emit bursts of harmful radiation from
your body.

MP Cost: 5.

Benefits: You are immune to mild, low, and moderate degrees of radiation
exposure. In addition, your body acts as a radiation battery, storing the
energy for later use. Once per day as a free action, you may release a
60-foot-radius burst of radiation centered on you. All creatures within the
burst radius are exposed to a moderate degree of radiation (Fortitude DC 18,
incubation period 3d6 hours, initial and secondary damage 1d6–1 Con).
