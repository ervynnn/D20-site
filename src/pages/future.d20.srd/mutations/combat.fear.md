title: Combat Fear
layout: '~/layouts/MarkdownLayout.astro'
---
Due to a chemical imbalance in your brain, you are gripped by an inexplicable
fear whenever you face a dangerous or frightening situation.

MP Value: 4.

Drawback: After initiative is rolled but before you take your first action in
combat, make a Will saving throw (DC 15). If you fail the Will save, you are
shaken for the rest of the encounter, taking a –2 penalty on attack rolls,
saving throws, and skill checks. If the save succeeds, you overcome your
moment of fear and negate the ill effects.
