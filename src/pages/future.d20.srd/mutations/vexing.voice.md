##  Vexing Voice [MAJOR]

You can vex another creature using the peculiar resonance of your voice.

MP Cost: 4.

Benefit: Select any living creature within 30 feet of you as the target; the
creature must be able to hear your voice to be affected. Upon hearing your
voice, the creature must make a successful Will save (DC 10 + one-half your
level + your Charisma modifier) or be dazed for 1 round. A successful save
negates the effect. This ability is a mind-affecting compulsion usable three
times per day. Using this ability is a free action.
