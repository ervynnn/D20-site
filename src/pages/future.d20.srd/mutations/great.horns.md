title: Great Horns
layout: '~/layouts/MarkdownLayout.astro'
---
You sprout horns capable of damaging or goring a target. The horns may be
curled like a ram’s or pointed like a bull’s. Conversely, you may grow a
single horn in the middle of the forehead, like that of a rhinoceros, or a
large rack of antlers, like that of an moose.

MP Cost: 1.

Benefit: You gain a single gore attack that deals bludgeoning damage (curled
ram horns or moose antlers) or piercing damage (pointed bull horns or one
great rhino horn). The amount of damage depends on your size: Small 1d4,
Medium-size 1d6, Large 1d8. If you get multiple attacks in a round, you can
gore multiple times. Your horns are treated as natural weapons and do not
provoke attacks of opportunity.
