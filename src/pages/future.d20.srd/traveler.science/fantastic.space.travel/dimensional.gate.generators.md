## Dimension Gate Generators

The technology behind dimension gates is highly advanced. The first working
gates are treated as late Progress Level 7 technology, and concerted human
exploration of alternative dimensions begins at Progress Level 8. The
calculations required for dimensional travel are complex, but the calculations
for safe travel—arriving at the intended destination with no loss of carrier
signal—are tens of thousands of times more complex.

Actually traveling through a dimension gate is easy, but changing the setting
is more complex. A character must succeed on a Navigate check (DC 30) to reset
the gate to a known destination; setting the gate to an unknown (but safe)
destination is a DC 40 Navigate check. (These checks should be rolled
secretly.) Performing either check requires 30 minutes of calibration. Of
course, if the destinations have been preset, any character can change the
settings as a move action without making a check.

Dimension gate generators come in a variety of forms, each operating somewhat
differently.

### D-Gate Generator (PL 7–9)

The first dimension gate generators—appearing at Progress Level 7— are
Gargantuan objects that cannot be transported once assembled. The PL 7 D-gate
creates a transdimensional aperture approximately 10 feet in diameter and
allows for one-way transport only. Due to the incredible power drain, the gate
remains open for only 1 round, after which the generator shuts down and cannot
be activated again for 24 hours.

The PL 8 D-gate is a Huge object weighing 200 pounds, but due to its bulk, the
generator requires at least two people to lift and haul it. It creates a
transdimensional aperture up to 20 feet in diameter, and the generator can
keep the gate open for up to 10 rounds, after which the generator shuts down
and cannot be activated again for 24 hours. Dimensional mapping makes
calculations to reset the gate’s destination easier (Navigate check, DC 25),
and any given gate can store up to five predetermined destinations. Travel is
still one-way, but with the larger aperture and the destination presets, the
equipment to construct another D-gate can be transported through, and the
travelers’ home dimension can be locked into the new gate upon startup.

At PL 9, D-gates large enough to transport starships exist (although they can
be almost any size), and they can store up to twenty predetermined
destinations. The calculations are even easier (Navigate check, DC 20), and
scientists have finally learned how to keep the gate open indefinitely. Best
of all, dimensional travel through PL 9 D-gates is two-way, allowing for round
trips.

Purchase DC: 54 (PL 7 D-gate generator), 48 (PL 8 D-gate generator), 46 (PL 9
D-gate generator).

Restriction: Military (+3).

### D-Drive Generator (PL 8–9)

The D-drive generator can be incorporated into a starship’s engine design,
allowing the ship to travel between dimensions. Considered the safest form of
dimensional travel, D-drive generators allow ships in space to cross
dimensions. Due to the enormous power drain, the Ddrive generator shuts down
for 12 hours after the dimensional jump is completed. In addition, the
starship’s weapon systems, defense fields, defense screens, and engines shut
down for 2 hours. At Progress Level 8, only Colossal starships can be fitted
with a D-drive generator. Progress Level 9 sees many improvements in the
D-drive generator.

Any size starship can be equipped with one, and the generator can be
reactivated after 6 hours; the ship’s disabled weapons, defense fields,
defense screens, and engines come back online after only 10 minutes.

Purchase DC: 48 (PL 8 D-drive generator), 44 (PL 9 D-drive generator).

Restriction: Military (+3).

### Dimension Wand (PL 8–9)

The dimension wand is a personal dimension gate generator. It creates a
rupture in the fabric of reality just large enough for one character to step
through into another dimension. The gate remains open until the wand itself
passes through, so multiple characters can step through without using their
own wands. The drawback to the dimension wand is that it must be recalibrated
after each use (see Equipment Failure, above), or entirely new dimensional
coordinates must be entered, as though changing the settings. The PL 8 version
of the dimension wand weighs only 1 pound. The PL 9 version has the same
purchase DC, with the added benefit that it stores the last five dimensional
coordinates automatically, enabling anyone to thumb through settings without
recalibrating the wand.

Weight: 1 lb.

Purchase DC: 42.

Restriction: Restricted (+2).

### Other Gear

### Dimensional Transceiver (PL 8)

A dimensional transceiver permits two-way communication across dimensions,
although dimensional static can sometimes hinder or block communications. The
somewhat bulky PL 8 transceiver can be carried like a backpack; a handheld
version is available at PL 9.

A dimensional transceiver must be calibrated to transmit signals to a given
dimension. Assuming the coordinates have already been plotted using some kind
of dimension generator (see above), calibrating the transceiver takes a full-
round action and requires a successful Computer Use check (DC 15), The PL 9
version can store the coordinates of up to five different dimensions.

Size: Medium (PL 8), Tiny (PL 9).

Weight: 4 lb. (PL 8), 1 lb. (PL 9)

Purchase DC: 24.

Restriction: Restricted (+2).
