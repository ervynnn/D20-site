Temporal displacement drives—colloquially known as “time machines”—do not
exist until Progress Level 8. The first time machines are faintly reminiscent
of the brass, ivory, and quartz machine invented by H.G. Wells in his novel
The Time Machine, though made of lightweight aluminum and resembling something
more like bathyspheres. Those that follow are constructed as fixed tunnels
leading to nowhere, while those mounted in starships turn the entire ship into
the time machine.

### Time Sphere (PL 8)

Time spheres are small, two-seated modules designed to withstand any
reasonable amount of buffeting that might occur when the machine finally comes
to rest in a different time period. At the very least, the self-contained
atmosphere should give the occupants time to “reverse course” should they
discover that conditions outside are too hostile to disembark. The time sphere
carries sensors designed to test outside conditions immediately upon arrival.

The temporal displacement mechanism itself is arranged around the inside of
the sphere, giving the occupants full access to the electronics in case of
emergency. The main computer has all programs necessary to operate the machine
and is crammed with historical and linguistic information, electronic
encyclopedias, and any other information that might be necessary to survive in
a different time. Operation of the time sphere is quite simple for characters
familiar with computers. One simply sets the desired date and time and presses
the “Go” button.

Time spheres are not sold commercially. In fact, doing so is illegal, but the
plans to construct them are quite common. The components have a total purchase
DC of 36. Building a time sphere chassis takes 12 hours and requires a
successful Craft (mechanical) skill check (DC 25). Building and filling the
time sphere’s computer (a much more daunting exercise) takes 120 hours and
requires a successful Craft (electronic) check (DC 35).

Time spheres have the following statistics:

Crew 2; Passengers 0; Cargo 120 lb.; Defense 6; Hardness 5; Hit Points 24;
Size Huge; Purchase DC: 65; Restriction: Illegal (+4).

### Temporal Drive Generator (PL 9)

Like the D-drive generator, which is designed to carry starships across
dimensional boundaries, the temporal drive generator (or “T-drive generator”)
carries starships through time. The drive can be mounted in a starship of any
size and turns the entire ship into a time machine.

Purchase DC: 60.

Restriction: Military (+3).

### Time Bridge (PL 9)

Doing away with the issue of portability, the time bridge opens a portal to
both other times and other places. The time bridge also has the advantage of
not leaving a fragile piece of vital equipment lying about while its operators
go exploring. Instead, the travelers use a simple “message-drop” system to
communicate with their base of operations: Upon arrival, they conceal a small
transmitter somewhere near their point of embarkation. They then have a
prearranged amount of time to explore and return to the location to catch the
next appearance of the time bridge. If they do not return, an operative from
their base emerges to search for the transmitter.

Assuming he finds it, the operative records a message on the transmitter,
letting the explorers know when the bridge will reappear again, or he collects
any recorded message the explorers might have left indicating where and when
to pick them up. The process repeats until the explorers are brought back
safely. Travel through the time bridge is comparable to walking through a
tunnel. Operators at the base set the temporal and physical coordinates at the
other end, and a team of travelers walks into the tunnel and seems to vanish.
For the travelers, the point of origin simply becomes less “real” as the
destination becomes more real. The bridge is large enough to accommodate
vehicles up to Huge size.

Purchase DC: 71.

Restriction: Illegal (+4).
