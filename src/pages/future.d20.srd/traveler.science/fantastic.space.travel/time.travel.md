The dream of time travel probably arose out of a desire to go back and correct
one’s past mistakes—or to visit the future and subsequently return to take
advantage of foreknowledge. The concept intrigues historians and
archaeologists for obvious reasons. Science fiction has explored the
possibility of time travel many times, as well as the pitfalls of visiting the
past and impacting the future.

Technically, time travel—of the “into the future” sort—is within the realm of
possibility. In fact, it happens all the time—just on such a small scale that
no one notices. Given that a starship engine could be developed that
accelerates a ship to relativistic speeds at which time dilation occurs, time
travel can be achieved simply by achieving 90% of the speed of light for a
short time, then returning to one’s point of origin. For every minute you
spend flying at 90% the speed of light, 2.3 minutes pass everywhere else.
Travel at relativistic speeds long enough and you could return to a time
predating the rise of human civilization!

Traveling into the future isn’t a very useful ability if one has no way
back—which is where the concept of traveling into the past breaks down. The
principle of causality rather logically argues that an effect cannot occur
before its cause—meaning, in this case, that one cannot arrive in the past via
the use of a time machine before that time machine is invented.
