## Reentry

Anything that travels too fast in an atmosphere generates an enormous amount
of friction, which produces tremendous heat. (Temperatures of 2,280 degrees
Fahrenheit have been recorded.) Objects trying to enter a planetary atmosphere
safely must shed velocity. However, decelerating consumes large amounts of
fuel, and many ships (especially at Progress Level 5) simply don’t have
enough. As an alternative, scientists have developed ways to slow ships in
reentry by using the atmospheric friction itself. Ablative shielding or
ceramic tiles take care of any excess heat. Even so, entering a planet’s
atmosphere is a tricky business; the angle of entry is precise, and deviation
either way causes the heat to build up too quickly for the heat shields to
reflect away from the ship. Worse yet, during the most intense heating, the
ship is surrounded by a thin layer of plasma that blocks radio signals, and
the crew have no contact with ground control.

Entering planetary atmosphere safely requires a Pilot check (DC 20) each round
for the 1d10+20 rounds it takes to slow the ship using friction alone. Success
means that the ship takes only 3d6 points of fire damage each round. Failure
means that the ship’s angle is too low, and that it is not shedding velocity
fast enough; the ship takes 6d6 points of fire damage each round until the
pilot succeeds at the Pilot check to correct the angle of descent. If the
check fails by 5 or more, the angle is too steep, and the ship takes 10d6
points of fire damage each round until the pilot succeeds at the Pilot check
to correct the angle. Each round spent at too low an angle does not count
toward the number of rounds required to land the ship; the ship isn’t making
any downward progress. Conversely, each round spent at too steep an angle
counts as 2 rounds, indicating that the ship is descending much faster than it
should.
