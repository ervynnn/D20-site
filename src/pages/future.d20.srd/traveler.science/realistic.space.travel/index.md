When speaking of space travel, it is important to distinguish interplanetary
travel from interstellar travel. Travel between planets is within the grasp of
modern technology and is likely to become easier as science develops new fuel
sources or new ways to maximize existing fuel sources. Travel between stars,
on the other hand, calls for some truly radical leaps in a number of different
fields.
