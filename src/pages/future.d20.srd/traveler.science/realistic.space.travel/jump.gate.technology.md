## Jump Gate Technology

If a starship cannot reach the speed of light through sheer thrust, perhaps
the answer lies in bending the laws of time and space so that the distance
itself is shorter. A ship could then get around the need to travel at
relativistic speeds, leaving behind the problem of increased mass and
negating—if not actually reversing— the effects of time dilation. In other
words, if one could find a shortcut through the galaxy, it might be possible
for spacecraft to travel quickly between star systems, and perhaps even travel
backward in time.

Shortcuts through space and time are called wormholes. Wormholes are created
naturally when black holes collapse, though they tend to close so rapidly that
a ship attempting to pass through would instead encounter a singularity—a
point with infinite density and a radius of zero—and be instantly crushed.
But, if the technology were developed to enable a wormhole to remain open, it
might become possible for spaceships to enter wormholes, travel for a few
million miles, and emerge several light years away—perhaps at the point of a
white hole.

White holes are theoretical objects that spew energy into the universe from
unknown sources. One theory suggests that quasistellar objects (also known as
quasars) are actually white holes, at the far end of which might be wormholes.
Thus, it is theoretically possible to enter a wormhole in one location in the
universe, and emerge from a white hole in another. Such a stable conduit could
be called a jump gate.

At Progress Level 5, the technology does not exist to stabilize wormholes in
order to create jump gates, though by PL 6 scientists might have developed the
technology to map the exit points of wormholes. With a theoretical advance in
astrophysics, humanity might be ready to make the first safe jump by Progress
Level 7.

### Jump Holes

In theory, a collapsing wormhole in a strong enough gravitational field could
remain open of its own accord, creating a kind of natural jump gate, or “jump
hole.” The jump hole would function the same way as a jump gate but could
close while travelers are en route to the exit point.

A jump hole might collapse while there are ships still traveling through its
jump space. Roll d% each hour; on a result of 100, the hole collapses. If this
happens, any ships in its jump space immediately drop back into “real”
space—most likely in the middle of nowhere. Determine what percentage of the
journey the ship had completed, then compare that percentage to the real
distance; this is how far from its destination the ship is.

### Jump Gate (PL 7)

Jump gates consist of gigantic rings in space that use fusion reactors to
generate a magnetic field capable of holding open a collapsing wormhole. This
allows starships to enter the wormhole, engage their engines, and reduce the
effective travel distance to the wormhole’s exit point by a factor of 1,000.
For example, the 48,360,000-mile trip from the Earth to Mars would be reduced
to 48,360 miles via a jump gate (assuming a wormhole had appeared near the
Earth and that its exit point was near Mars). Thus, a starship with PL 6 ion
engines traveling through “jump space” could reach Mars in approximately 1.6
hours (instead of 67.2 days) and completely avoid the effects of time
dilation.

Jump gates have a few limitations:

  * Jump gates have only one exit point. Therefore, a jump gate from Pluto to Alpha Centauri is useless to characters who don’t want to go to Alpha Centauri.
  * Jump gates are one-way. The journey to the exit point might be comparatively short, but the journey back could take just as long as it always did—or require a circuitous route from jump gate to jump gate, some of which could be dozens of light years out of the way.
  * Jump gates are rarely located near one another. A starship might have to cross an entire system to get from one exit point to the next jump gate.
  * Maneuvering a jump gate into position requires a successful Navigate check (DC 35). If this check fails by 5 or more, the jump gate collides with the closing wormhole and is crushed against the forming singularity.

In PL 7, jump gates are most likely owned by megacorporations that charge for
their use. The toll varies according to the real distance between the jump
gate and the exit point: Divide the real distance by 1,000,000 miles to
determine the purchase DC for passage through the jump gate.

Purchase DC: 75 (per jump gate).

Restriction: Licensed (+1).

### Jump Network (PL 8)

As science develops ways to harness the power of singularities,
astrophysicists apply the technology to wormholes. A jump network is a series
of jump gates that can each serve as an entry or exit point. Thus, jump gates
are no longer one-way: A jump gate can take a ship from the Earth to Mars and
back. Further, the network could also include jump gates leading to and from
Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto.

Jump gates in the network are still expensive, but the risk of placing one has
completely vanished; the jump gate merely has to be moved into the desired
position—usually a Lagrange point—and switched on.

Many gates in the jump network are owned by megacorporations, who charge for
their use. Some gates are operated by the military and have restricted access.
However, the gates between common locations like planets and stars are
government owned and designated for public use.

Purchase DC: 75 (per jump gate).

Restriction: Licensed (+1).

### Jump Drive (PL 9)

The jump drive is a portable version of a jump gate. Ships carrying a jump
drive can create a stable, though temporary, wormhole. The artificial wormhole
lasts until the ship that created it emerges from the exit point.

The jump drive suffers from one major limitation. Once a ship has entered jump
space, it has only two real options: continue to the exit point or deactivate
the jump drive. The ship cannot change course while in jump space; it must
drop out of jump space, set a new course, and re-engage the jump drive. The
drawback to this is that jump drives require a lot of energy; recharging the
drive takes hours, as shown on Table: Jump Drive Recharge Time.

Purchase DC: 25 + one-half the base purchase DC of the starship.
