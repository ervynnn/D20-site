## Interplanetary Travel

In Progress Level 5, humanity has the technology to send unmanned probes to
the edge of the solar system. However, human sojourns into space are limited
to orbital missions and trips to the Moon, as longer journeys would take
decades and consume ridiculous amounts of fuel and oxygen.

Interplanetary travel becomes possible at Progress Level 6. Ships fitted with
magnetic ram scoops allow the crew to manufacture fuel from particles of
hydrogen gas floating loose in space (though at only a few atoms per cubic
inch). Such a ship could even incorporate a particle accelerator that converts
matter into antimatter—with far more efficient thrust-to-payload ratios than
solid fuel. With a sufficient supply of food, water, and oxygen, a ship so
equipped could travel to the edges of the solar system and perhaps to another
solar system entirely.
