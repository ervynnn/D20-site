## Civilian Trucks

Trucks usually have the same features as civilian cars, with the same luxury
options. Trucks provide three-quarters cover to their occupants, except as
noted below. The operative skill for trucks is Drive.

### Cretan Motors “Hecaton” (PL 6)

The national automobile company of Crete came late to the industry, but has
made impressive strides toward winning over truck buyers. The Hekatoncheires
pickup truck—inaccurately referred to as the “Hecaton” by its target
market—combines impressive power with high durability and generous cargo room
in the bed. The sixwheel design includes puncture-resistant tires and is
popular with construction companies. The cab can be sealed against harsh
environments—ads show them driving into lakes and being pulled out with the
interior dry as a bone and the occupants casually listening to the stereo. The
Hekatoncheires is 3 squares wide and 4 squares long.

### Cretan Motors Kentaur (PL 6)

Cretan Motors produces a smaller, faster, “light-duty” pickup with many of the
same features of the larger Hekatoncheires but without all the cargo space.
The Kentaur is 2 squares wide and 3 squares long.

### Gaia Motor Company Virgo (PL 6)

The Gaia Motor Company developed a line of automobiles powered by the popular
fusion minireactor. The Virgo minivan is a top seller, capable of high speeds
yet comfortably easy to handle. It is 2 squares wide and 3 squares long.

### Zhang Motors XRL (PL 7)

The XRL is designed to operate using a less expensive particle reactor, rather
than t he s lightly more stable fusion minireactor. This gamble ultimately
paid off when an XRL won the Australian Rally Challenge. The XRL comes only in
a two-door style. It is 2 squares wide and 3 squares long.
