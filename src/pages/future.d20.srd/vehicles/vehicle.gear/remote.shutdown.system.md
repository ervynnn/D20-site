title: Remote Shutdown System

This public safety feature, introduced at Progress Level 6, is required by law
on all civilian vehicles. The remote shutdown system consists of a
microcomputer attached to the vehicle’s electrical system plus a microantenna.
At a coded signal from an authorized law enforcement officer (via a dashboard-
mounted unit installed in most police cruisers), the remote shutdown system
switches off the vehicle, bringing it to a slow, safe stop (and, in the case
of flying or hovering vehicles, a safe descent).

Law enforcement agencies maintain huge databases of codes for civilian
vehicles, enabling officers to quickly determine the code for a vehicle by
make, model, year, or license plate. Searching for a code requires a full-
round action. Entering the code to shut down the vehicle is an attack action.

This system is installed on all civilian vehicles. Acquiring a civilian
vehicle without a remote shutdown system or acquiring a vehicle with an
altered code (so that the owner can shut it down, but no one else can) is
treated like buying an illegal item. Removing the system—an illegal
act—requires a successful Disable Device check (DC 15). Changing the code—also
an illegal act—requires a successful Computer Use check (DC 30).

An installed remote shutdown system does not increase a vehicle’s purchase DC.
