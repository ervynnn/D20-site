Anti-accident systems use airbags, fire-retardant foam, no-skid brakes,
gyroscopic stabilizers, and other safety features to improve a driverâ€™s
chances of surviving or averting accidents.

The system reduces collision damage by half, though this only applies to the
vehicle equipped with an anti-accident system.

Further, the operator of a vehicle so equipped gains a +2 equipment bonus on
Drive or Pilot checks to make hard brake or hard turn maneuvers.

Purchase DC: 17.

Restriction: None.
