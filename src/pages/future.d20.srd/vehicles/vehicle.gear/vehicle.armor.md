## Vehicular Armor

Armor can be welded or otherwise fixed securely to a vehicle’s chassis,
providing an equipment bonus to the vehicle’s Defense. Vehicular armor also
makes a vehicle more ungainly, imposing a penalty on the vehicle operator’s
Drive or Pilot checks. Vehicular armor does not require a special license to
purchase. Installing armor on a vehicle requires 12 hours and a Craft
(mechanical) check (DC 20). Armor can be removed in half the time with a
successful Repair check (DC 20).

Different types of vehicular armor are described below, complete with the
following statistics:

**Equipment Bonus** : The equipment bonus that the armor provides to the
vehicle.

**Drive/Pilot Check Penalty** : Apply this penalty to the vehicle operator’s
Drive or Pilot checks.

**Purchase DC** : The cost of the vehicular armor.

### Alumisteel Armor (PL 5)

This easy-to-acquire alloy is lightweight and reasonably strong.  
**Equipment Bonus** : +5.  
**Drive/Pilot Check Penalty** : –3.  
**Purchase DC** : 15 + the vehicle’s hardness.

### Duraplastic Armor (PL 5)

Duraplastic armor is made of advanced plastic polymers, like carbon fiber and
high-grade fiberglass. Although relatively cheap and light, it doesn’t offer
tremendous protection.  
**Equipment Bonus** : +3.  
**Drive/Pilot Check Penalty** : –2.  
**Purchase DC** : 10 + the vehicle’s hardness.

### Duralloy Armor (PL 6)

Duralloy is harder, heavier, and more durable than alumisteel.  
**Equipment Bonus** : +8.  
**Drive/Pilot Check Penalty** : –4.  
**Purchase DC** : 15 + the vehicle’s hardness.

### Resilium Armor (PL 6)

Resilium is more malleable alloy than duralloy, although not as strong.  
**Equipment Bonus** : +6.  
**Drive/Pilot Check Penalty** : –2.  
**Purchase DC** : 10 + the vehicle’s hardness.

### Crystal Carbon Armor (PL 7)

“Grown” in orbital laboratories, crystal carbon is a composite fiber material
that narrowly outperforms neovulcanium (see below) on the battlefield.  
**Equipment Bonus** : +10.  
**Drive/Pilot Check Penalty** : –4.  
**Purchase DC** : 20 + the vehicle’s hardness.

### Neovulcanium Armor (PL 7)

Similar to duralloy, neovulcanium uses plasma-forging techniques to create an
alloy of surprising resilience.  
**Equipment Bonus** : +10.  
**Drive/Pilot Check Penalty** : –5.  
**Purchase DC** : 15 + the vehicle’s hardness.

### Megatanium Armor (PL 8)

Sandwiched layers of crystal carbon and neovulcanium held in a magnetic
matrix, megatanium is exceedingly hard and durable.  
**Equipment Bonus** : +12.  
**Drive/Pilot Check Penalty** : –5.  
**Purchase DC** : 20 + the vehicle’s hardness.

### Reactive Armor (PL 8)

Consisting of layers of insulating gel or compressed gas between cerametal
sheets, reactive armor provides the same protection as crystal carbon armor
but is considerably cheaper and easier to produce.  
**Equipment Bonus** : +8.  
**Drive/Pilot Check Penalty** : –2.  
**Purchase DC** : 15 + the vehicle’s hardness.
