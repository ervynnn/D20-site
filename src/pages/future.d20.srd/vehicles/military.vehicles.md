## Military Vehicles

Despite being grouped together under the military vehicle heading, some of
these vehicles are used by law-enforcement and emergency services. The
operative skill for these vehicles depends on their mode of travel. Generally,
the Drive skill is used for vehicles that travel on the ground or on water; if
the vehicle flies or hovers, Pilot is the operative skill.

### Appel-Siems Gyrocopter (PL 6)

Appel-Siems created its one-seat helicopter for the military, but many exist
in the law enforcement roles and in the corporate sector. The mostly enclosed
cockpit gives its pilot three-quarters cover. Its body is 1 square wide and 3
squares long.

### EU2A1 Mendez (PL 6)

The Mendez armored personnel carrier is fusion-powered and fully enclosed. The
crew consists of a driver and two gunners. The vehicle has three topside
hatches, located directly above each crew position, with a large door/ramp in
the back for infantry troops to board or disembark. Entering or disembarking
through a top hatch requires a full-round action. The Mendez is 3 squares wide
and 4 squares long, and it provides full cover to all its occupants.

The EU2A1 Mendez has a pair of mounted twin thunder machine guns mounted near
two of the three topside hatches.

### UN-500 Turtledove (PL 6)

One of the last military helicopters in use by the United Nations before they
were replaced with hovervehicles, the Turtledove was a familiar sight over the
battlefields of PL 6. It is 4 squares wide and 10 squares long.

### IS-2000 Ifrit (PL 7)

The IS-2000 Ifrit APC is faster, more durable, and carries more troops than
the Mendez APC. The Ifrit is crewed by a commander, a driver, and two gunners,
each of whom has a topside hatch located directly above them. Entering or
disembarking through a top hatch requires a full-round action. The rear door
is not built for fast deployment, requiring a full round to open or close. The
Ifrit is 3 squares wide and 4 squares long, and it provides full cover to all
its occupants. The IS-2000 Ifrit has a mounted twin thunder machine gun near
one topside hatch and a mounted rail gun near another. The twin thunder fires
PL 6 plasma-coated rounds, while the rail gun fires rail gun shards.

### M-300 Hovertank (PL 7)

The M-300 Hovertank is powered by a particle reactor and crewed by a pilot,
gunner, gun loader, and commander. It comes equipped with a fully turreted
M-300 Rhino mass cannon as its main gun and a T-95 Cavalcade chaingun in a
separate turret located above the commander’s hatch. (Modified versions of
these weapons designed for mecha also exist.) Each crew position has a topside
hatch located directly above it. Entering or disembarking through a top hatch
requires a full-round action, and starting the Hovertank requires another full
round action.

The M-300 Hovertank is 3 squares wide and 6 squares long, and it provides full
cover to all its occupants. A more expensive version of the Hovertank comes
equipped with neovulcanium armor and an onboard tactical assist system (see
Vehicle Gear, below).

Statistics for the Hovertank’s M-300 Rhino mass cannon and T-95 Cavalcade
chaingun are presented in Table: M-300 Hovertank Weapons.
