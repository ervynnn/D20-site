### New Vehicles

As oil prices rise and consumers insist on more safety measures in vehicles,
engineers push the technology envelope. The major motor companies create
personal hovermobiles that handle like cars, build cars that drive themselves,
and unveil vehicles that can travel over water, underwater, and, in some
cases, underground.

### Vehicles And Progress Levels

Although each of the vehicles listed below has a Progress Level associated
with it, specifics of the vehicle can be modified to fit into an earlier or
later Progress Level. Modify the top speed, initiative, and maneuver scores of
vehicles—lower numbers for lower PLs, higher numbers for higher PLs—and adjust
the purchase DC accordingly.
