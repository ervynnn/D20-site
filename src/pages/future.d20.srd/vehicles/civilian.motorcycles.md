## Civilian Motorcycles

Mounting a motorcycle is a free action, and the motorcycle provides no cover
to its occupants—except as noted below. The operative skill for motorcycles is
Drive.

### Harris-Musselman Dirt Bike (PL 6)

Known as the “Muscleman,” the H-M is a popular recreational motorcycle that
also happens to enjoy wide use by military recon units. It is 1 square wide
and 2 squares long.

### Stradtler Valkyrie (PL 7)

Stradtler’s version of the street bike upholds the Norwegian motor company’s
reputation for high performance and luxury. Constructed on the “chopper”
frame, the Valkyrie has a triple-wide rear tire and a center of gravity set
slightly further back than normal street cycles, enabling it to get up on the
rear wheel for impressive displays of motorcycle riding. It is 1 square wide
and 2 squares long.
