The following gadgets are found in the Gravity Age and can apply to weapons of
that era or later, provided all gadget-specific restrictions are observed.

###  Sound Suppressor

Similar to the technology that produced the silent suit, the sound suppressor
gadget is the Gravity Age replacement for the silencers of the modern era.
Since energy weapons cannot make use of the traditional silencers found on
most ballistic weapons, the sound suppressor takes over this function with
almost all Gravity Age weapons.

The sound suppressor generates a field of sonic energy that cancels sound
produced within field, reducing weapon firing noise to a mere whine of sonic
energy discharge. The sound suppressor adds +10 to the DC of Listen checks
made to hear the weapon firing.

**Restrictions** : Ranged weapons only.  
**Purchase DC Modifier** : +3.
