The following gadgets are found in the Fusion Age and can apply to weapons of
that era or later, provided all gadget-specific restrictions are observed.

### Scope, Video

The video scope is a special modification to ranged weapons that provides an
easier way to survey remote portions of the battlefield from the comfort of a
safe haven. The video scope is a three-inch- by-three-inch viewscreen attached
to the rear of a standard scope. It allows the weapon’s user to sit back and
examine the details in the image rather than having to press his eye against
the scope. Additionally, the viewscreen can be used to freeze-frame and take
still images and boasts zoom and image enhancement software, allowing on-the-
fly computer analysis and dissection of battlefield images. Some video scopes
are capable of receiving broadcast images from remote locations, allowing the
screen to be used for video communication (by jacking in an optional earpiece
and microphone) or to transmit maps and movement orders with visual aides.

**Restrictions** : Ranged weapons only.  
**Purchase DC Modifier** : +3.
