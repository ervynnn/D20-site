### Medium Combat Armor

Designed for heavy warfare and dangerous situations, medium combat armor
covers the user almost head to toe in armor plating. Medium combat armor comes
with a helmet that fits snugly on the head and does not interfere with the
soldier’s field of vision.

### Silent Suit

The silent suit uses cutting-edge sonic dampening technology to increase the
stealth of the user. Silent suits look like form-fitting bodysuits with
padding on the shoulders, elbows, and knees. Sonic dampening field generators
are built into the suit, reducing to a minimum the noise made by movement. A
character wearing a silent suit gains a +10 equipment bonus on all Move
Silently checks.

### Space Combat Armor

Space combat armor is the first true powered armor to reach common use. Space
combat armor consists of heavy body armor with an environmental seal and
built-in communications gear. Additionally, space combat armor boasts a
jetpack specifically designed to function in space, allowing the user to
maneuver in zero-g conditions. Space combat armor can be difficult and
unwieldy, but makes even individual soldiers a threat in ship-to-ship combat.
