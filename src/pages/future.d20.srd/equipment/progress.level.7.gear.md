The Gravity Age sees many of the most revolutionary changes to technology,
particularly to technology used on the battlefield. Plasma weapons are finally
made small enough to become practical for battlefield use, while the first
powered armors begin to take shape. The advent of gravity-related technology
brings some new forms of construction as well, incorporating new gravity-based
technologies in practical ways.
