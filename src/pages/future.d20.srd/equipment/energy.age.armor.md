### Boost Armor

Boost armor is powered armor that augments the character’s physical abilities.
A character wearing boost armor is stronger, faster, and more nimble than ever
before. Special mechanisms augment physical strength, granting a +4 bonus to
the character’s Strength score. Sensors can detect incoming attacks and
augment reaction times, granting a +2 bonus on all Reflex saves.

Additionally, boost armor can improve traction and augment the ability to move
quickly, increasing the character’s movement speed by 10 feet. Boost armor is
lightweight and form-fitting, and provides less protection than heavier combat
armors.

### Unisoldier Heavy Combat Armor

The ultimate step in the creation of the one-soldier army, unisoldier heavy
combat armor is an all-in-one package that makes the wearer a formidable
opponent in combat. The wearer is covered from head to toe. The helmet
includes a built-in heads-up display and a visor that changes tint to dampen
the effects of sudden bright lights, making flash-bang grenades useless
against the wearer. Additionally, the armor usually has built-in slots for the
addition of onboard computer systems, though not all armors make use of the
option.
