At the dawn of the Information Age, the value of knowledge and accurate
intelligence became a crucial aspect of warfare. The ability to connect to a
global communications network was critical to the success of any army, as
intelligence traveled at the speed of light across the globe to command
centers safe behind defended battle lines. The satellite datalink gadget
enables any piece of equipment, from computer to communication device to
heads-up display, to connect to a global (or, if in place, galactic) satellite
network and communicate with computer systems in far remote areas.

**Restrictions** : This gadget may only be used with gear containing
