##  Paint-On LCD

One of the most revolutionary advances in computer technology during the
Information Age and beyond is the paint-on LCD gadget. This allows almost any
surface to be used as a computer display, as it grafts the color-changing
pixels common to all display devices onto another surface.

Any piece of equipment with the paint-on LCD gadget can be used as a display
for any piece of computer or communications equipment. Additionally, weapons
and armor may make use of the paint-on LCD gadget at the normal cost, but gain
no special benefit from the modification other than being able to display
data.

**Restrictions** : None.  
**Purchase DC Modifier** : +4.
