almost any situation is the ability to store and carry small items in a safe
place. The storage compartment gadget accomplishes just that, incorporating an
empty space where other objects can be carried by the wearer with relative
ease. Each storage compartment gadget allows the wearer to carry two items of
size Small or smaller in a container built into the armor. This gadget may be
taken multiple times, each time providing another compartment where small
items may be carried.
