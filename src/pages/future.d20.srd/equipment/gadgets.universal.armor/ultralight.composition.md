##  Ultralight Composition

The development of new and experimental alloys constantly allows armor
technology to advance to the point where once bulky and heavy armors become as
easy to carry as lighter models. Any armor with the ultralight composition
gadget weighs significantly less than similar pieces of armor and is more
easily used and worn. The armor reduces its Armor Check Penalty (if any) by 1.
Furthermore, the armor’s speed limitation is increased by 5 feet (to a maximum
of the user’s normal speed). So, for example, an armor with an Armor Check
Penalty of –2 and a speed limitation of 20 feet now has an Armor Check Penalty
of –1 and a speed limitation of 25 feet.

**Restrictions** : None.  
**Purchase DC Modifier** : +4.
