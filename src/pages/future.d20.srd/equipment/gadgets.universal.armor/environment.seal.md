##  Environment Seal

Since many armors are designed with a particular environment in mind, this
gadget provides the wearer protection from harsh conditions.

The environment seal gadget transforms any armor into a stable and insulated
artificial environment. This provides the wearer with the right amount of
breathable air and external pressure to assure comfort and survival for up to
eight hours, ensuring that the armor can function in the extremes of the deep
sea or deep space,along with any environment in between. Only certain types of
armor can handle this modification and those that do usually integrate a
sealed helmet, body glove, and emergency air tanks to generate internal
atmosphere.

**Restrictions** : Medium, heavy, or powered armor only.  
**Purchase DC Modifier** : +4.
