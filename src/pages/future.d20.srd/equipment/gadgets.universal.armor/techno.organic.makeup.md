##  Techno-Organic Makeup

Though the technology of Earth is based on electronics and mechanics, some
alien cultures may have developed technology based on living organisms working
in harmony for an intended purpose. Additionally, advanced civilizations may
make use of certain biological forms of technology integrated with their own
mechanical devices to form a techno-organic hybrid capable of performing
certain tasks with increased efficiency.

An armor with the techno-organic makeup gadget is composed of living tissue or
a biological/mechanical hybrid material. Unlike normal armors, armor with this
gadget heals itself at a rate of one hit point per hour when damaged.
Additionally, armor with this gadget is susceptible to diseases and poisons
specifically designed to target techno-organic material.
