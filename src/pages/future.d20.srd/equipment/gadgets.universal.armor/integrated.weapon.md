##  Integrated Weapon

Some armors are designed with specific combat purposes in mind and build in
certain weapons as standard equipment. Examples run from a pair of pop-out
wrist blades to shoulder-mounted plasma cannons. Additionally, many armors
link their weapons to integrated heads-up displays, turning the user into a
walking combat machine.

When selecting the integrated weapon gadget, choose a single weapon. That
weapon is integrated into the base armor and can be used at any time.
Additionally, you must choose whether or not the weapon may be physically
separated from the base armor or not at the time of purchase. This gadget may
be selected multiple times, each time adding a single additional weapon to the
base armor.

**Restrictions** : The character must also purchase the weapon to be
integrated separately from the base armor, before the gadget modification is
made.  
**Purchase DC Modifier** : See text.
