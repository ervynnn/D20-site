##  Gravity Age Equipment Gadgets

The following gadgets are found in the Gravity Age and can apply to equipment
of that era or later, provided all gadget-specific restrictions are observed.

###  Hud Software, Ammunition Tracker

A piece of software for the heads-up display device, the Ammunition Tracker is
able to keep track of exactly how many shots have been expended from a
particular weapon. Additionally, when a character starts to get low on
ammunition, a warning flashes on the HUD indicating that a reload must occur
soon.

**Restrictions** : Heads-up display only, requires a weapon with an integrated
computer. **Purchase DC Modifier** : +1.

###  Sound Suppressor

Similar to the technology that produced the silent suit, the sound suppressor
gadget silences almost any noise. It generates a field of sonic energy that
cancels sound produced within field, reducing all noise to a mere whine of
sonic energy discharge. The sound suppressor adds +10 to the DC of Listen
checks made to hear the weapon firing.

**Restrictions** : None. **Purchase DC Modifier** : +3.
