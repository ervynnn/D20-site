##  Stun Module

One advantage of energy weapons over their ballistic and physical counterparts
is that they are capable of altering their own output on the fly. With the
stun module gadget, this means that an energy weapon can be used to apply
nonlethal force. The stun module is an alternate firing mode; switching to or
from stun mode is a free action (just like changing a weaponâ€™s rate of fire).
Whenever a character fires a weapon set to stun and successfully hits the
target, the target must make a Fortitude save (DC determined by cost of the
gadget) or be stunned for 1d4 rounds.

**Restrictions** : Energy weapons only.  
**Purchase DC Modifier** : +2 (Fort DC 12); +4 (Fort DC 15); +6 (Fort DC 18).
