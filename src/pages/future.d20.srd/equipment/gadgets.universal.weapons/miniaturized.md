##  Miniaturized

By eliminating wasted space and using microscopic components, some engineers
are capable of producing weapons vastly smaller than normal. Any weapon that
makes use of the miniaturized gadget is two size categories smaller than
normal, to a minimum size of Diminutive.

A weapon to which the miniaturized gadget has been added cannot fire standard
ammunition. It must fire appropriate ammunition modified by the miniaturized
universal equipment gadget.

This gadget can only be added to ranged weapons, as most melee weapons rely on
size and mass to deliver damage.

**Restrictions** : Ranged weapons only.  
**Purchase DC Modifier** : +5.
