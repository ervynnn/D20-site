Some weapons are designed to be concealed from sight and then quickly drawn
into the hand at a moment’s notice. The spring-loaded gadget ensures that
small weapons can remain hidden under layers of clothes or armor and still be
called to action at any time. The bearer of a weapon with this gadget
automatically gains the benefits of the Quick Draw feat with this weapon only,
even if the weapon is hidden from sight on that character’s person.

**Restrictions** : Weapons of size Small or smaller only.  
**Purchase DC Modifier** : +2
