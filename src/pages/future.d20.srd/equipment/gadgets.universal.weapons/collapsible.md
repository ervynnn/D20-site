In situations that call for stealth and deception, it is of great value to be
able to separate an item into its parts and transport them in their broken
down state. A weapon that makes use of the collapsible gadget is easily
disassembled and reassembled at a moment’s notice. Breaking down a weapon into
its individual parts requires a full-round action, while reassembling them in
the correct order requires another full-round action. Obviously, the weapons
must be fully assembled to be used. In its disassembled state, a weapon is not
easily identified; a Knowledge (technology) check (DC 17) is required to
identify a collapsed weapon for what it really is.

**Restrictions** : None.
