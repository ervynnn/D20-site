##  Voice Recognition System

A countermeasure commonly built into weapons is the voice recognition system
gadget. It requires any user to speak a command word to unlock the weapon
before it can be used. Some weapons couple the voice recognition system with
the booby trap gadget to require a voice command to reset the weapon to its
previous state. Any weapon with the voice recognition system gadget will not
fire or activate unless the owner (or designated group) gives the command word
to the weapon.

**Restrictions** : None.  
**Purchase DC Modifier** : +1.
