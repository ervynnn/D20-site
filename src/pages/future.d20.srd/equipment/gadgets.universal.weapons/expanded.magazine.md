##  Expanded Magazine

Some weapon engineers recognize that stopping to reload a weapon in combat is
a dangerous and potentially life-threatening maneuver. Taking steps to reduce
the amount of time required to keep the weapon full, these engineers have
increased the ammunition capacity of the weapon to reduce the frequency with
which it must be reloaded. Any weapon with the expanded magazine gadget
doubles its normal magazine capacity. This gadget may only be taken once per
weapon.

**Restrictions** : Ranged weapons only.  
**Purchase DC Modifier** : +2.
