##  Autoloader Module

Many weapons rely on box magazines or power packs to function. The autoloader
gadget facilitates quick reloading. This may come in the form of an integrated
power pack alternator, or in spring-mounted magazine loaders worn on the wrist
of the user. Regardless of their location on the owner’s body or the form that
the autoloader takes, a weapon with the autoloader module gadget is always
automatically reloaded as a free action as soon as the previous magazine or
power pack is expended. This module cannot be transferred from one weapon to
another, even those of similar types, due to the fact that each autoloader
module is keyed to the individual weapon for which it was designed.

**Restrictions** : Ranged weapons using box magazines or power packs only.  
**Purchase DC Modifier** : +3.
