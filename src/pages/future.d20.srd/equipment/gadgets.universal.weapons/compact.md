By eliminating wasted space and using smaller components, some engineers are
capable of producing weapons far smaller than their standard counterparts. Any
weapon that makes use of the compact gadget is one size smaller than normal,
to a minimum size of Diminutive.

This gadget can only be added to ranged weapons, as most melee weapons rely on
size and mass to deliver damage.

**Restrictions** : Ranged weapons only.  
**Purchase DC Modifier** : +2.
