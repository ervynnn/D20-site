From simple metal detectors to advanced x-ray scanners, there’s a way to
detect every weapon. As the technology level increases, so does the accuracy
of weapons sensing devices. The ability to confuse these sensors can be
invaluable, especially when smuggling weapons past security. Any weapon with
the sensor baffling gadget grants a +4 bonus on any checks made to conceal the
weapon from sensors or other detection devices.

**Restrictions** : None.  
**Purchase DC Modifier** : +2.
