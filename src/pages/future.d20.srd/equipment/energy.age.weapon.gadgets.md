## Energy Age Weapon Gadgets

The following gadgets are found in the Energy Age and can apply to weapons of
that era, provided all gadget-specific restrictions are observed.

### Teleporting Magazine

One disadvantage to the use of ranged weapons has always been limited
ammunition. Unless the weapon’s bearer is willing to cart around a bulky power
backpack or ribbons of ammunition, reloading is always a problem. The
teleporting magazine gadget allows a character to reload without ever having
to actually reload; when the weapon detects that it has run out of ammunition,
the current box magazine is teleported out of the weapon and another one is
teleported in instantaneously. Though the character never has to reload, he
must possess enough magazines or power packs to be teleported in or else the
gadget does not function.

**Restrictions** : Ranged weapons only. **Purchase DC Modifier** : +6.
