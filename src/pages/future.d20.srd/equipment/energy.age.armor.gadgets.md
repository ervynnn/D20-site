## Energy Age Armor Gadgets

The following gadgets are found in the Energy Age and can apply to armors of
that era, provided all gadget-specific restrictions are observed.

### Gravity Anchor

With space combat almost as common as ground combat in the Energy Age, armor
manufacturers seek to make their armor more useful in both space and
atmospheric combat. One such enhancement is the gravity anchor gadget, which
generates a field of artificial gravity around the armor’s wearer. In low
gravity and zero gravity conditions, the gravity anchor can be activated to
give the wearer the benefits of full gravity in any situation. Characters with
this gadget are unaffected by low gravity and zero-g conditions.

**Restrictions** : None.  
**Purchase DC Modifier** : +4.

### Morphic Metal Alloy

A combination of nanotechnology and armor engineering, morphic metal alloy is
a special material used in the construction of armor to enhance the user’s
ability to move freely. When activated, morphic metal bends and shapes itself
to the contours of the wearer’s body, giving it both a snug fit and increased
mobility. An armor with the morphic metal alloy gadget reduces its armor check
penalty by 1 and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus by 1 as well.

**Restrictions** : None.  
**Purchase DC Modifier** : +6.

### Neg-Grav Boosters

Similar in design to the gravity anchor, but with an opposite purpose, neg-
grav boosters can be installed into any armor to give the wearer the benefits
of low gravity conditions. Neg-grav boosters create a low-gravity field around
the user and counteract the effects of gravity, allowing the character to jump
to incredible heights. Any armor with this gadget grants a +10 bonus on all
Jump checks in any situation where gravity is a factor. This gadget has no
function in zero-g environments.

**Restrictions** : None.  
**Purchase DC Modifier** : +4.
