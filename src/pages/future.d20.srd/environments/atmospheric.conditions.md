## Atmospheric Conditions

As with variants in gravity, a change in atmospheric conditions can cause
major problems for characters. Unfortunately, not every planet will have the
same atmospheric density or chemical composition as Earth, meaning that worlds
otherwise hospitable to human life may not be ideal for humans born and raised
on Earth.

Various atmospheric conditions (and their effects) are presented below.

### Corrosive Atmosphere

Some atmospheres (breathable or not) contain corrosive chemicals and gases.
Corrosive atmospheres slowly eat away at foreign equipment and can cause
significant equipment failure. The corrosion can be particularly troublesome
in atmospheres that demand special survival gear, as any breach in a
protective environmental suit renders it useless. Unprotected equipment
exposed to a corrosive atmosphere takes 1d4 points of acid damage per hour of
exposure. This damage ignores hardness and deals damage directly to the
equipment, eating away at it slowly.

Creatures not wearing protective gear in a corrosive atmosphere take 1d4
points of acid damage per round of exposure.

### Thin Atmosphere

Planets with thin atmospheres have less oxygen per breath than the standard
Earth atmosphere. Many thin atmospheres are the equivalent of being at a high
elevation on Earth, such as on top of a mountain or in the upper atmosphere. A
creature exposed to a thin atmosphere must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 20)
every hour. On the first failed save, the creature is fatigued. A fatigued
creature that fails a subsequent save becomes exhausted for as long as it
remains in the thin atmosphere. After 1 hour of complete, uninterrupted rest
in a normal atmosphere, an exhausted creature becomes fatigued. After 8 hours
of complete, uninterrupted rest, a fatigued creature is no longer fatigued.

### Thick Atmosphere

Thick atmospheres are those that contain a more dense concentration of certain
elements, like nitrogen, oxygen, or even carbon dioxide, than the standard
Earth atmosphere. These dense atmospheres sometimes contain a different
balance of elements, while others simply contain a higher number of gas
particles in each breath. The effects of exposure to a thick atmosphere are
similar to those of a thin atmosphere (see Thin Atmosphere, above), except the
Fortitude save DC is 15 instead of 20

### Toxic Atmosphere

Some atmospheres (breathable or not) contain toxic gases that are debilitating
or lethal to some or all forms of life. The atmosphere is treated as always
containing a type of inhaled poison.

### Vacuum

Despite some popular myths, moving into a vacuum does not cause the body to
explosively decompress, nor does it cause instant freezing as heat bleeds away
from the body. Rather, the primary hazards of surviving in the vacuum of space
are the lack of air and exposure to unfiltered ionizing radiation.

On the third round of exposure to vacuum, a creature must succeed on a
Constitution check (DC 20) each round or suffer from aeroembolism (“the
bends”). A creature that fails the save experiences excruciating pain as small
air bubbles form in its bloodstream; such a creature is considered stunned and
remains so until returned to normal atmospheric pressure. A creature that
fails the Constitution check by 5 or more falls unconscious.

The real danger of vacuum comes from suffocation, though holding one’s breath
in vacuum damages the lungs. A character who attempts to hold his breath must
make a Constitution check (DC 15) every round; the DC increases by 1 each
round, and on a successful check the character takes 1 point of Constitution
damage (from the pressure on the linings of his lungs). If the check fails, or
when the character simply stops holding his breath, he begins to suffocate. In
the next round, he falls unconscious with 0 hit points. The following round,
he drops to –1 hit points. On the third round, he drops to –10 hit points and
dies.

Unfiltered radiation bombards any character trapped in the vacuum of space
without protective gear. A creature exposed to this ionizing radiation suffers
from severe sunburn as well as the effects of radiation exposure; the degree
of exposure depends on the nearest star’s classification (see Star Systems
below for more information).

### Decompression

The sudden decompression of a starship, vehicle, or other object can be
dangerous to creatures inside. Whenever a sealed environment within a vacuum
is breached, all of the air inside rushes out quickly to equalize the air
pressure. Creatures within the decompressing environment must succeed on a
Reflex save (DC 15) or be thrust toward the breach (and possibly beyond it) at
a speed of 60 feet per round. Creatures that are three size categories larger
than the breach’s size category are big enough not to get dragged toward the
breach (no Reflex save required). For example, a Fine breach pulls only Fine,
Diminutive, and Tiny creatures toward it; creatures of Small size or larger
are unaffected.

If the breach’s size category is larger than the creature’s size category, the
creature passes through the opening and is blown out into the vacuum. If the
breach’s size category is the same as the creature’s size category, the
creature is blown out into the vacuum and takes 1d6 points of damage as it
gets pushed through the breach. If the breach is one or two size categories
smaller than the creature’s size category, the creature isn’t thrust into the
vacuum but takes 2d6 points of damage as it slams against the area around the
breach. It takes another 2d6 points of damage each round until the air
completely evacuates from the decompressed compartment or until the creature
pulls itself away from the breach with a successful Strength check (DC 20).

The time it takes for all of the air to evacuate from a compartment depends on
the size of the breach and the volume of the decompressing compartment, as
shown in Table: Decompression Times.

Once the air has completely rushed out through the breach, the pressure
equalizes and the interior environment becomes a vacuum.
