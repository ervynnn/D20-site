## Star Systems

A star system can contain one star or multiple stars. Humans are more likely
to find habitable planets in systems with single stars. In reality, more than
half of all star systems have two or more stars, and these systems typically
contain planets that are inhospitable to human life.

### Star Type

Stars are classified using a lettering system that describes the star and
gives information about its type. Known as the spectral class of a star, a
designation of O, B, A, F, G, K, or M is given to the star based on its mass
and energy output. Class O stars are the hottest, largest, and brightest
stars, and class M stars as the smallest and coldest, with a gradual scale
between them. Since a star’s mass determines how hot it burns (as well as how
strong its gravity pull is), the star’s classification actually helps
extrapolate the kinds of planets that might be in that star’s system. Since
larger stars burn hotter and smaller stars burn cooler, the mass of a star
determines the climate of the worlds that orbit it.

In addition to the standard array of star types, several other types of stars
(or what were once stars) might be found at the center of a star system. Most
of these stars (called “non-main sequence stars”) have characteristics that
make certain planetary conditions impossible, and no type of non-main sequence
star is likely to support worlds hospitable to human life. Types of non-main
sequence stars include black holes, neutron stars, white dwarf stars, black
dwarf stars, brown dwarf stars, and red supergiants.

Degree of Ionizing Radiation: Ionizing radiation—radiation that breaks down
atoms within living tissue—is common in space. All stars produce and emit
harmful levels of ionizing radiation, and a star system is considered an
“irradiated area” for the purposes of determining radiation exposure,
particularly in the vacuum of space. (Planetary atmospheres and protective
environment suits can protect a creature from ionizing radiation.) The degree
of radiation exposure depends on the nearest star’s classification, as shown
in Table: Star Systems. For systems with two or more stars, increase the
degree of radiation by one grade (lightly becomes moderately, moderately
becomes highly, and highly becomes severely).

Number of Planets: The number of planets in a given star system can be
determined by rolling on Table: Star Systems. For systems with multiple stars,
use the star with the fewest planets allowable to determine the number of
planets in the system.

### Hospitable Stars

The chief classifications of hospitable stars are F, G, and K. These stars
produce the right amounts of heat and the right types of radiation to allow
human-compatible worlds to exist. Not every world around a Class F, G, or K
star is hospitable; however, even inhospitable worlds within such systems
could be made to support human life with artificial modifications to their
ecosystems (a long a painstaking process called “terraforming”).

### Inhospitable Stars

Class O, B, A, and M stars are the least likely to support planets capable of
hosting human life. T he s tars toward the hotter end of the spectrum simply
produce too much heat to allow living, breathing organisms to thrive. Class M
stars do not give off enough heat to support life at the distance Earth orbits
its sun, and these stars are also known to be violently unstable and prone to
bursts of stellar activity.

### Black Holes

Black holes are stars that have expended their fuel sources and exploded in a
massive supernova. Few, if any, planetary bodies survive the initial death of
such a star. Once the star has exploded, its gravity is so great that it
collapses in on itself and warps light, time, and space around it. Black holes
drag all nearby matter into its center, collecting rings of cosmic debris
called accretion discs that can be seen at great distances. Some planets and
asteroids might survive being pulled into a black hole long enough for some
adventuring, but they are incredibly dangerous places to explore.

### Neutron Stars

A neutron star is a large star that has exhausted its fuel source but hasn’t
collapsed in on itself. Instead, the entire star’s remaining matter compresses
into a much smaller body mere kilometers in diameter. Within this tightly
packed core, the star’s density crushes the atoms into an object composed
entirely of subatomic particles known as neutrons. Planets orbiting a neutron
star are typically cold, lifeless, and severely irradiated. Another type of
neutron star is the pulsar, which emits severe levels of radiation at great
distances.

### White Dwarf Stars

A white dwarf star is so much smaller than a neutron star that it does not
have the mass to collapse in on itself. Instead, white dwarfs are typically
small and dense and surrounded by rings of wreckage that were once planetary
bodies in its system. White dwarfs emit little light or energy, and the rings
surrounding them are usually cold and dark. However, these rings are not
bombarded by as high levels of radiation as in a neutron star and could
potentially support life, assuming enough heat could be generated.

### Black Dwarf Stars

Black dwarf stars completely burn out after expending their fuel. Truly the
most stable of dead stars, black dwarfs simply consume their fuel supply and
then cool into a cinder that emits no light or heat. Any planetary systems
that existed around a black dwarf will remain intact; however, they usually
become barren and frozen once their heat and light source is gone.

### Brown Dwarf Stars

In many ways, the brown dwarf is not even a star. Brown dwarf stars are
stellar bodies that almost coalesced into true stars but never managed to form
completely. Brown dwarfs are dim and small. They may have planets in their
system, but rarely can these worlds support life due to the lack of heat or
light.

### Red Supergiants

Most red supergiants begin their lives as average-sized stars. However, they
burn hot and expend their hydrogen fuel supplies quickly. When its hydrogen
supply is depleted, a red supergiant begins burning other, heavier elements
such as helium, causing the star to expand to enormous size. An expanding red
supergiant consumes its innermost planets and then burns so hot and bright
that it renders all other planets in its system incapable of supporting life
naturally.
