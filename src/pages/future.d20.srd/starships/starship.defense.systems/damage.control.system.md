##  Damage Control System (PL 5)

A starship equipped with a damage control system can perform damage control as
a move action. With a successful Repair check (DC 15), the ship regains a
number of hit points depending on its type, as shown on Table: Damage Control
Systems. Damage control cannot be performed if the ship has been reduced to
negative hit points.

Purchase DC: Varies by starship type (see Table: Damage Control Systems).

Restriction: None.
