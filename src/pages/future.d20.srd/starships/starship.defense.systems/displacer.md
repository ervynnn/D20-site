##  Displacer (PL 7)

Using the same technology that will someday drive the PL 9 spatial compression
engine, the displacer “shifts” the ship a few hundred yards several times a
second in a random series of short-range teleportations.

All enemy attacks against the displacing ship have a 30% miss chance, as
though it has three-quarters concealment.

A mine can be equipped with a displacer.

Purchase DC: 10 + one-half the base purchase DC of the starship or mine.

Restriction: Military (+3).
