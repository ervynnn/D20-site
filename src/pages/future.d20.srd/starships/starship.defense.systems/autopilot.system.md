##  Autopilot System (PL 5)

An autopilot system “kicks in” whenever the pilot is unable to fly the
starship. An autopilot system isn’t as good at avoiding attacks as a living
pilot, but it’s better than nothing. Larger vessels have more adaptive
autopilot systems than smaller ships (although this increased sophistication
doesn’t outweigh the penalties associated with the ships’ larger sizes).

An autopilot system provides an equipment bonus to the starship’s Defense
depending on the ship’s size: Huge +1, Gargantuan +2, Colossal +4. This bonus
applies only when the autopilot system is engaged.

Purchase DC: 5 + one-quarter the base purchase DC of the starship.

Restriction: None.
