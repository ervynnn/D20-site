title: Light Fortification
layout: '~/layouts/MarkdownLayout.astro'
---
The starship’s structural integrity is reinforced so that the ship can shake
off attacks that would cripple it otherwise. Light fortification converts 25%
of all critical hits into regular hits.

Installing light fortification requires a Craft (structural) check instead of
a Craft (mechanical) check.

Purchase DC: 10 + one-half the base purchase DC of the starship.

Restriction: Licensed (+1).
