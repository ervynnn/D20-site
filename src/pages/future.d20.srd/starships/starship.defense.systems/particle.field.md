Generators project a field of alpha particles (helium nuclei that have been
stripped of their electrons) around the ship. The field absorbs energy damage;
weapons that wholly or partly deal concussion, electricity, fire, or
nonspecific energy damage (such as beam weapons) fired at the starship take a
–4 penalty on attack rolls.

A mine can be equipped with a particle field.

Purchase DC: 10 + one-half the base purchase DC of the starship or mine.

Restriction: Military (+3).
