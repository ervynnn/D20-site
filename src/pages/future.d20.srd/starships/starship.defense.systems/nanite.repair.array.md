title: Nanite Repair Array
layout: '~/layouts/MarkdownLayout.astro'
---
The final refinement of damage control systems, the nanite repair array
consists of numerous nodules filled with nanites—microscopic robots—scattered
throughout the ship. The nanite repair array can repair a ship with negative
hit points; however, not even nanites can repair a destroyed ship.

Purchase DC: 10 + one-half the base purchase DC of the starship.

Restriction: Restricted (+2).
