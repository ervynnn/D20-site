## Nanite Repair Array (PL 8)

The final refinement of damage control systems, the nanite repair array
consists of numerous nodules filled with nanites—microscopic robots—scattered
throughout the ship. The nanite repair array can repair a ship with negative
hit points; however, not even nanites can repair a destroyed ship.

Purchase DC: 10 + one-half the base purchase DC of the starship.

Restriction: Restricted (+2).
