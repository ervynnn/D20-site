### Fusion Beam (PL 6)

The fusion beam initiates a fusion reaction and then directs the blast at the
target.

### Gauss Gun (PL 6)

The gauss gun is an electromagnetic accelerator that fires tiny ball bearings
at an extremely high velocity.

### Laser (PL 6)

The simplest beam weapon, the laser is used generally for small craft. It
consists of a focused beam of white-hot light.

### Laser, Heavy (PL 6)

The heavy laser is simply an oversized laser that pours more energy on the
target. It’s too big to install on light spacecraft, but is common on
destroyers and larger warships.

### Mine, Fusion (PL 6)

A fusion mine initiates a fusion reaction that deals damage to all starships
in its square and all adjacent squares.

### Missile, CHE (PL 6)

A CHE (conventional high-explosive) warhead can destroy a small vessel, but
it’s less effective against larger warships unless launched in numbers. Heavy
vessels, such as battleships, can usually ignore the weapon despite its
payload of hundreds of kilos of advanced chemical explosives.

### Missile, KE Submunition (PL 6)

This warhead consists of a bundle of dozens or even hundreds of tungsten steel
darts, each mounted on small rocket motors. As the weapon approaches its
target, the warhead splits open, unleashing a lethal hail of high-velocity
metal arrows. The impact alone can vaporize several square yards of heavy
armor.

### Missile, Nuclear (PL 6)

This 1-megaton warhead is essentially a fusion bomb rigged to a guided rocket.

### Needle Driver (PL 6)

The needle driver is a larger, heavier version of the rail cannon (see below),
with an extremely high rate of fire. It fires small metal flechettes at the
rate of thousands of rounds per minute.

### Neutron Gun (PL 6)

This device directs an intense blast of neutron radiation at the target.

### Neutron Gun, Heavy (PL 6)

This weapon is simply a larger version of the neutron gun.

### Rail Cannon (PL 6)

Rail cannons use a series of electromagnets to propel projectiles down a
magnetic track. The projectiles are kinetic-energy weapons with no explosive
charge, but at close ranges, they can still be quite devastating.
