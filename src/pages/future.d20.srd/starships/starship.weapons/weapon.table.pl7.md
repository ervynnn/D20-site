### Antimatter Gun (PL 7)

Using the same basic technology as the PL 6 rail cannon, the antimatter gun
throws a piece of antimatter at the target. The impact alone is extremely
destructive. Following the initial impact damage, the “splatter” of antimatter
from the disintegrating warhead creates a cluster-bomb effect around the point
of impact, increasing the chance of a critical hit.

### Mass Cannon (PL 7)

The mass cannon uses gravitic technology to “charge” a small bit of matter
with incredible gravitational energy, then hurls it at the target, where its
increased gravitational pull causes it to slam into the target like a wrecking
ball.

### Mass Cannon, Heavy (PL 7)

The heavy mass cannon is a larger and more powerful version of the mass
cannon.

### Mine, Gravitic (PL 7)

When a gravitic mine detonates, it creates a brief artificial gravity well
that pulls on ships in its square and in all adjacent squares, tearing their
hulls.

### Missile, Mass Reaction (PL 7)

This warhead uses a dark matter reaction to unleash a powerful wave of energy.
The effect is more concentrated than a nuclear blast, but it’s less likely to
cause unwanted collateral damage.

### Missile, Plasma (PL 7)

The plasma warhead improves on the PL 6 chemical explosive. It creates a burst
of white-hot plasma that can blast a small ship out of space with one shot.

### Particle Beam (PL 7)

The next phase of the PL 6 neutron gun, the particle beam projects a stream of
protons, neutrons, or alpha particles at the target—each particle accelerated
to near light-speed.

### Particle Beam, Heavy (PL 7)

This weapon is simply a larger version of the particle beam.

### Plasma Cannon (PL 7)

Using a powerful electrical charge to convert a mix of chemicals into white-
hot plasma, this weapon then accelerates the plasma mass toward the target
with a simple rail gun. The result is a bolt of incandescent plasma that can
explosively vaporize objects in its path.

### Plasma Cannon, Heavy (PL 7)

This weapon is simply a larger version of the plasma cannon.

### Quantum Cannon (PL 7)

The quantum cannon fires a stream of highly charged subatomic particles,
destabilizing the atoms of the target and creating localized fission
reactions.
