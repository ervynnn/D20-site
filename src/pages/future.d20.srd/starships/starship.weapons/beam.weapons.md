## Beam Weapons

Beam weapons deal energy damage, usually of a nonspecific type. They range
from weapons as simple as a high-powered laser to monstrous devices capable of
harnessing the fundamental forces of the universe.

Beam weapons draw power from a starship’s power plant and are considered to
have unlimited ammunition.

Beam Weapon Mounts: Beam weapons are mounted on turrets or in banks that,
coupled with the starship’s ability to adjust its orientation, allow the
weapons to fire in any direction. The cost of a turret mount or bank is
included in the purchase DC of the weapon.
