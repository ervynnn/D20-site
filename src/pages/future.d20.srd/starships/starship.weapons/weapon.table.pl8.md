### Automaser (PL 8)

The automaser uses multiple firing arrays to channel high-energy maser
compressions into shorter pulse widths. This weapon fires only in automatic
mode.

### EMP Cannon (PL 8)

The EMP cannon induces an electromagnetic pulse effect similar to that of a
nuclear explosion. This makes the EMP cannon especially effective against
electronic equipment. In addition to taking damage, the starship is dazed for
1 round. Neither crew nor passengers are dazed, however.

### Kinetic Lance (PL 8)

The kinetic lance creates a high-velocity stream of virtual particles
simulating solid matter. The impact of these particles is quite
destructive—rather like a collision with a solid object.

### Maser Cannon (PL 8)

Maser cannons channel an enormous amount of power through a linear antenna
array, creating a broad-spectrum blast of energy that devastates the target
with heat, light, and intense radiation.

### Maser Cannon, Heavy (PL 8)

The heavy maser cannon is a larger version of the maser cannon. With 1 hour of
work and a successful Repair check (DC 30), a heavy maser can be reconfigured
for semiautomatic or automatic fire mode. (Resetting the weapon to its
original configuration requires another check and another hour of labor.)
Increase the purchase DC of the modified pulse maser by +5.

### Mine, Zero Point (PL 8)

This mine creates a spontaneous quantum fluctuation of energy—the same energy
as the Big Bang, though obviously on a smaller scale.

### Missile, Nova Burst (PL 8)

The nova burst warhead generates an incredible gravitational force that
compresses normal matter into an incredibly dense mass, which then explodes in
a colossal detonation.

### Missile, Starload (PL 8)

The starload warhead is essentially an improved version of the PL 7 mass
reaction missile.

### Neutronium Driver (PL 8)

This version of the rail gun is configured to fire a projectile of false
neutronium—a slug the size of a baseball, but with a temporary mass of
thousands of tons. Because neutronium is electrically neutral, the driver
mechanism actually encapsulates the projectile in a sleeve or sabot of
ordinary matter to fire the slug.

### Sliver Gun (PL 8)

An efficient mass driver loaded with flechettes of tungsten steel, the sliver
gun is the PL 8 version of a heavy machine gun. It cycles at a rate of fire of
almost 4,000 rounds per minute, and each sliver can tear through a yard or
more of heavy armor.

### Zero Bore (PL 8)

The zero bore creates a stream of energy that encourages extraordinary amounts
of quantum energy fluctuation—the so-called “zero point” energy. Anything in
its path is wrecked by the spontaneous destruction of space itself.
