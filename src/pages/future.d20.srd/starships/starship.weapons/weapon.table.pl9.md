### Blacklaser (PL 9)

Using the fluorescent gaseous form of dark matter, a blacklaser fires a beam
of coherent light. To human eyes, it appears to be a beam of purplish light
bordering on ultraviolet, but it is composed of radiation much more energetic
and dangerous than ordinary photons.

### Mine, Null (PL 9)

This weapon is horrifyingly simple in design. It harnesses nuclear strong
force to generate a field in which all atomic bonds cease to exist. Matter in
the mine’s square and all adjacent squares is pulverized into subatomic dust.

A null mine ignores a ship’s hardness.

### Singularity Cannon (PL 9)

The singularity cannon creates a quantum black hole and fires it at the enemy.
A quantum black hole is no bigger than a single molecule, but it masses
hundreds of millions of tons and can rip even the toughest armor to shreds.

### String Projector (PL 9)

The string projector creates a super-dense cosmic string that passes through
the target. A cosmic string is a short-lived chain of extraordinary mass; the
effect on the target is similar to being pierced by the mass of a mountain,
but concentrated into a space the size of a strand of hair.

### Tachyon Gun (PL 9)

The tachyon gun fires a blast of high-energy, faster-than-light particles at
the target.
