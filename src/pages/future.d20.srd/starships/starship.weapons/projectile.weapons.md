## Projectile Weapons

Projectiles are generally solid slugs delivered to the target, where the
velocity and density of the slug hopefully punch through the target’s
defenses. The most basic projectile weapons launch a small hunk of metal at
roughly the speed of sound; the most advanced can push around mountains or
molecules at greater than the speed of light.

Projectile weapons tend to be slightly more expensive than beam weapons, but
the top end damage is considerably higher.

Starships have sufficient storage space to contain a virtually unlimited
supply of projectile weapon ammunition.

Projectile Weapon Mounts: Like beam weapons, projectile weapons are mounted on
turrets or in banks that, coupled with the starship’s ability to adjust its
orientation, allow the weapons to fire in any direction. The cost of a turret
mount or bank is included in the purchase DC of the weapon.
