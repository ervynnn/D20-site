The ability to communicate with other ships and bases is vital to starships.
The more advanced a ship’s communications capabilities, the better informed
its crew is, and the better they can coordinate with other ships in the same
fleet.

To build a communication system from scratch, a character must succeed at a
Craft (electrical) check (DC 30) after investing a number of hours equal to
the ship’s Hit Dice. A character without an electrical tool kit takes a –4
penalty on the skill check. The character must also make a Wealth check
against the system’s purchase DC.

Installing a comm system requires a successful Craft (mechanical) check (DC
30) and a successful Craft (electrical) check (DC 30) after investing 30
hours. A character without a mechanical or electrical tool kit takes a –4
penalty on the appropriate skill check.

The following section describes various ship-to-ship comm. systems.

Purchase DC: The cost of the comm system.

###  Internal Comm Systems

Internal comm systems, though as vital as ship-to-ship communications, are not
covered in depth here. Obviously, the larger a ship’s crew complement, the
greater its need for internal communications. The crew must stay in contact to
do their jobs properly. Smaller ships can often get by with headsets jacked
into the ship’s network, or short-range two-way radios, or even just shouting
to each other from nearby crew stations. Larger ships require a more
sophisticated system.

A standard internal communication system allows twoway audio communication
from any comm station to any other comm station on the same ship. An internal
comm system has a purchase DC based on the ship’s type: ultralight 13, light
16, mediumweight 19, heavy 22, superheavy 25. Increase the purchase DC by +2
if the comm stations include video screen displays as well.
