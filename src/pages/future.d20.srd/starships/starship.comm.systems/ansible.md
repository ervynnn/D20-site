##  Ansible (PL 9)

The ansible is a device that induces precise changes in the energy states of
atomic nuclei, without regard to distance or time. In effect, it permits
instantaneous interstellar communications—voice, video, or data transfer—to
any other ship or station equipped with an ansible. Much like a radio, the
receiving station has to be attentive to a particular “frequency,” so two
ansible-equipped stations must have some prearranged communications protocols;
an ansible cannot pick up any transmissions not intended for that specific
frequency.
