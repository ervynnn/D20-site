The drive transceiver is the first interstellar comm system that’s truly
practical for small ships or second-rate colonies. It operates like the much
larger PL 7 drivesat comm array, sending a signal up to 50 lightyears distant.
The signal travels at a rate of 5 light-years per hour. The target station
must also be equipped with a drive transceiver.

Purchase DC: 28.
