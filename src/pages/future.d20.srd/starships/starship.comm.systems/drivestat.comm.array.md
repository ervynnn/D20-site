##  Drivesat Comm Array (PL 7)

This massive comm array provides rapid interstellar communications. The array
consists of a constellation of dozens of small transmitters that transmit and
receive messages through space at faster-thanlight speeds, enabling
communications with a range of 50 light-years.

The signals travel at a rate of 5 light-years per hour. Because of the need
for steady signal, the ship must remain stationary to transmit and receive
messages. If the ship moves while its drivesat array is transmitting or
receiving, the shipâ€™s communication officer must make a Computer Use check (DC
30) to avoid losing the signal.

Only mediumweight, heavy, and superheavy ships can be equipped with a drivesat
comm array.

Purchase DC: 53.
