title: Grapplers

Grapplers consist of two or more robotic arms fitted with magnetic grips or
pads capable of latching onto a single target, usually another ship. Grapplers
can also be used to grab Small or larger objects adrift in space.

Using grapplers against another ship or an unattended object is an attack
action. Against another ship, this action provokes an attack of opportunity if
the ship being grabbed has a point-defense system. To successfully grab the
target, the starship must first enter the target’s square; then the starship’s
pilot must succeed at a Pilot check. The Pilot check’s DC depends on the size
and Defense of the target being grabbed, as shown on Table: Grappler Pilot
Check DCs below. If the check succeeds, the starship successfully latches onto
the target, and the two ships continue to occupy the same space until the
grapplers release their hold. The grappling ship cannot move as long as it
wishes to remain latched and moves in concert with the grappled ship. Neither
ship can attack the other as long as the grapplers maintain their hold.

As an attack action, a grabbed starship can free itself from a grabbing ship
by succeeding at an opposed Pilot check. Each ship adds a special grapple
bonus on its check based on its size: Huge +8, Gargantuan +12, Colossal +16. A
ship may only attempt to free itself once per round.

A starship using grapplers to latch onto another ship can release the hold and
retract the grapplers as a free action.

Purchase DC: 10 + one-half the base purchase DC of the starship.

Restriction: None.
