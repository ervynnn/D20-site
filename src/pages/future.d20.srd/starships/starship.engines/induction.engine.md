## Induction Engine (PL 7)

Hands-down the best engine available at this or any previous Progress Level,
the induction engine uses artificial gravity to provide incredible thrust and
maneuverability. The induction engine requires no fuel and produces no
exhaust; it’s ideal for atmospheric, orbital, or deep-space work.

Minimum Ship Size: Huge.

Tactical Speed Bonus: +1,000 feet (+2 squares).

Purchase DC: 15 + one-half the base purchase DC of the starship.
