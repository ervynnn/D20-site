##  Gravitic Redirector (PL 8)

A refinement of the induction engine, the gravitic redirector creates a
gravitic singularity—essentially, a sub-microscopic black hole—in the vicinity
of the ship, producing a constant pull on the ship. By changing the location
of the singularity relative to the ship, the pilot can change the direction of
the ship’s travel. The gravitic redirector is more powerful and more efficient
than the induction engine, and at the height of the technology’s heyday,
virtually foolproof. A gravitic redirector does not operate within a planetary
atmosphere, and most ships fitted with this kind of engine also have secondary
thrusters or rely on shuttlecraft.

Minimum Ship Size: Colossal.

Tactical Speed Bonus: +1,500 feet (+3 squares).

Purchase DC: 10 + one-half the base purchase DC of the starship.
