## Achilles Targeting Software (PL 8)

Any starship with a targeting system can have Achilles targeting software; the
software does not take up one o f the starship’s sensor system slots.

Achilles targeting software enables the ship to better train its weapons on an
enemy’s critical systems. Achilles targeting software increases the critical
threat ranges of the ship’s beam, projectile, and missile weapons by 1. This
effect stacks with other systems that expand a weapon’s critical threat range,
such as weapon batteries.

The purchase DC of Achilles targeting software depends on the size of the
ship.

Purchase DC: 26 (Huge), 31 (Gargantuan), or 36 (Colossal).

Restriction: Restricted (+2).
