## Starship Class Templates

A starship class template allows the creation of modified or improved versions
of the various starship subtypes presented above. A template usually has an
evocative name, giving rise to such ships as the Lightning-class frigate or
the Katana-class assault fighter.

A starship class template is nothing more than an alternative list of design
specs that allow players and GMs to increase (or decrease) a ship’s Hit Dice
and swap out some or all of a starship’s systems. The following starship class
templates are presented as examples:

  * [Lightning Class](/future.d20.srd/starships/starship.types/starship.class.templates/lightning.class.template)
  * [Katana Class](/future.d20.srd/starships/starship.types/starship.class.templates/katana.class.template)
