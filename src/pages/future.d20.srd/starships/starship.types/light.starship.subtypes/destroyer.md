Destroyers take their name from the torpedo-boat destroyers of the late 19th
century. They are integral to the defense of a task force, screening it
against small craft and attack ships. Destroyers are often armed with one or
two bombs or missiles useful against much larger ships. A destroyer is usually
about 450 to 600 feet long and masses about 8,000 tons. It carries a crew of
150 to 200.
