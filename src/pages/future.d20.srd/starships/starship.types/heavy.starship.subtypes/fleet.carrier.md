title: Fleet Carrier
layout: '~/layouts/MarkdownLayout.astro'
---
The fleet carrier has the ability to launch devastating attacks from millions
of miles away, in the form of large numbers of fighters or assault fighters.
Most fleet carriers are lightly armed, as they rely on their escorting vessels
and payload of fighters to defend them against attack.

In addition to its normal cargo capacity, a fleet carrier can hold 16 fighters
or assault fighters. Its listed crew complement does not include the ace
pilots who fly these fighter craft. (Pilots count against the passenger
capacity.) A fleet carrier can deploy up to 4 ultralight craft as a move
action.
