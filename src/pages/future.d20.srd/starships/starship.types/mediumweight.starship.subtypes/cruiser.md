## Cruiser (PL 6)

The cruiser is a warship that serves several roles. It may be part of a task
force, escorting capital ships or laying mines. It may operate independently
as a scout and raider. Conversely, it may serve in diplomatic and scientific
tasks. Light cruisers frequently have outstanding endurance and can operate
with little or no resupply for months on end. A cruiser hull could serve
equally well as an escort carrier or assault transport.
