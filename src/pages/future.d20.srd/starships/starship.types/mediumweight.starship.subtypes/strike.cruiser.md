##  Strike Cruiser (PL 7)

These armored cruisers often serve as the centerpiece of raiding or patrolling
task forces, especially if heavier warships are unavailable. Many strike
cruisers are configured for task force command functions; the command cruiser
is a common variant of this hull type. A strike cruiser hull could easily
serve as a light carrier or assault carrier.
