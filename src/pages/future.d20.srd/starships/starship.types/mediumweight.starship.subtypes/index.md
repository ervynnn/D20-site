## Mediumweight Starship Subtypes

Mediumweight starships encompass cruisers, clippers, and most transports. They
balance firepower and defense with speed and maneuverability.

A mediumweight starship measures 501–1,000 feet long. It occupies a
1,000-foot-by-1,000-foot fighting space (4 500-foot squares). In addition, all
mediumweight starships share the following design specs.

Engines: All mediumweight starships have thrusters plus one other type of
engine (see Starship Engines).

Armor: A mediumweight starship has one type of armor (see Starship Armor).

Defensive Systems: A mediumweight starship has a maximum of one defensive
system per 25 Hit Dice (see Starship Defense Systems).

Sensors: A mediumweight starship has a maximum of three sensor systems (see
Starship Sensors).

Communications: A mediumweight starship has up to two external communication
systems (see Starship Comm Systems).

Weapons: A mediumweight starship has one beam, projectile, or missile weapon
per 25 Hit Dice (see Starship Weapons).

These weapons are often fire-linked or arrayed in batteries. A minelayer is
considered a single weapon. Although it weighs no more than a few thousand
pounds, each mine consumes 100 tons of a ship’s cargo capacity (most of it
taken up by the launch system and radiation shielding).

Grappling Systems: A mediumweight starship may have up to two grappling
systems (see Grappling Systems). Each grappling system takes away one of the
ship’s weapon slots (see above).
