##  Star Carrier (PL 7)

A larger version of the fleet carrier, the star carrier serves as a mobile
base for smaller craft. A star carrier’s fighting space takes up 36 500- foot
squares (a 6-square-by-6-square area).

In addition to its normal cargo capacity, a star carrier can hold 72 fighters
or assault fighters. Its listed crew complement does not include the ace
pilots who fly these fighter craft. (Pilots count against the passenger
capacity.) A star carrier can deploy up to 8 ultralight craft as a move
action.
