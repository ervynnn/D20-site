## Starship Types and Subtypes

Every starship has a type and a subtype. A starship’s type represents its
relative mass and determines its fighting space (how many 500-foot squares it
occupies) on the battle grid. There are five types of starships: ultralight,
light, mediumweight, heavy, and superheavy.

A starship’s subtype identifies the ship’s basic purpose or configuration.
Starship subtypes include the following: fighter, corvette, destroyer, strike
cruiser, battleship, and freighter.
