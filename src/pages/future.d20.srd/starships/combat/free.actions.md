## Free Actions

A starship can perform multiple free actions during its turn, subject to the
GM’s approval. In general, if one or more free actions take longer than 6
seconds to complete, they are not free actions. Free actions include
communicating via a comm system and turning.

### Communicate Via Comm System

Starships (and their crews) can communicate and coordinate with each other as
a free action. A GM may rule that a particularly long or complex message
cannot be communicated as a free action.

### Turn

Starships—even immensely large ones—are highly maneuverable in space. As a
free action, a ship can adjust its orientation on the battle grid by pivoting
or turning. The direction a starship is facing has no bearing on combat, since
its weapons can be trained to fire in any direction.
