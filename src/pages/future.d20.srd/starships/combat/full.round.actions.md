## Full-Round Actions

A full-round action requires an entire round to complete. If it doesn’t
involve moving any distance, a starship can combine it with a 500-foot shift.
Jump To Cruising Speed

As a full-round action, a starship can leave the battlefield by jumping to
cruising speed. Doing so effectively takes the ship out of the fight, although
enemy ships can pursue the fleeing ship if they wish.

A starship cannot jump to cruising speed if it has 0 or fewer hit points.

Attacks of Opportunity: A starship that jumps to cruising speed provokes
attacks of opportunity from threatening enemy ships armed with point-defense
systems (see Starship Defense Systems).

### Surge Forward

A starship can use its afterburners to surge forward as a full-round action.
When a starship surges forward, it can move up to four times its tactical
speed in a straight line. (It does not get a 500-foot shift.) It loses its
pilot’s Dexterity bonus to Defense and any dodge bonuses to Defense since it
can’t avoid attacks.

A starship can surge forward for as many rounds as the pilot likes.

Attacks of Opportunity: A starship that surges forward provokes attacks of
opportunity from threatening enemy ships armed with point-defense systems (see
Starship Defense Systems).

### Withdraw

Withdrawing from combat is a full-round action. When a starship withdraws, it
can move up to twice its tactical speed. (It doesn’t also get a 500-foot
shift.) The square it starts from is not considered threatened for purposes of
withdrawing, and therefore enemies with point-defense systems do not get
attacks of opportunity against it when it moves from that square.

If, during the process of withdrawing, the starship moves through another
threatened square (other than the one it started in) without stopping, enemies
get attacks of opportunity as normal.
