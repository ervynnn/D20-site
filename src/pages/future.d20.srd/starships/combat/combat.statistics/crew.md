## Crew

The quality of the crew determines how well a starship performs in and out of
combat. Unless otherwise noted, every starship has a trained crew of nonheroic
characters. However, situations could arise where a starship must rely on an
untrained crew. Conversely, expert crews and ace crews are also available—for
the right price. Table: Crew Quality compares four different qualities of
crew: untrained, trained, expert, and ace.

Skill Check Modifier: Apply this modifier to all skill checks made by crew.

Pilot’s Dexterity Modifier: A pilot’s Dexterity modifier applies to the
starship’s initiative rolls and the starship’s Defense.

Pilot’s Class Bonus to Defense: A pilot’s class bonus to Defense applies to
the starship’s Defense and to opposed grapple checks.

Gunner’s Attack Bonus: A gunner’s attack bonus applies to all ranged attacks
made by the ship.

Modifier to Starship’s Base Purchase DC: The amount by which the crew
increases the base purchase DC of the ship. (This modifier is already factored
in to the base purchase DCs of the ships presented below.)

### Crew Improvement

To improve in quality, a starship’s crew of nonheroic characters must “put in
the hours” and gain combat experience. Table: Crew Improvement shows the
length of the crew’s tour of duty and the number of ship-to-ship battles the
crew must survive to be considered of a particular quality. A crew cannot be
elevated to a higher quality until it meets the minimum required time spent
serving aboard the ship and the minimum amount of ship-to-ship combat
experience.
