title: Starship Evacuation
layout: '~/layouts/MarkdownLayout.astro'

Most ultralight starships are equipped with evacuation pods or fully enclosed,
detachable cockpits that jettison the crew to safety in the event of a
shipwide catastrophe. In fact, unless noted otherwise, every starship has
sufficient evacuation pods or launches to accommodate its normal crew
complement and passenger manifest.

A ship’s crew and passengers can evacuate any time before the ship is
destroyed (see above). Table: Evacuation Times shows the time required for
crews to evacuate, based on the ship’s type. While the crew is evacuating, the
starship either flies on autopilot (if it has 1 hp or more remaining) or is
stopped dead in space (if it has been disabled or is breaking apart).

Use the statistics for a launch (see below) to represent a typical evacuation
pod.
