title: Attack Roll
layout: '~/layouts/MarkdownLayout.astro'

An attack roll represents one starship’s attempt to strike another on its turn
in a round. Most starships are armed with ranged weapons aimed by gunners.
When a starship makes an attack roll, roll 1d20 and add the appropriate
modifiers (described below). If the result equals or beats the target’s
Defense, the attack hits and deals damage. A starship’s attack roll is:

1d20 + gunner’s ranged attack bonus + range penalty + starship’s size modifier
+ targeting system’s equipment bonus

Gunner’s Ranged Attack Bonus: Unless noted otherwise, all starship gunners are
assumed to have the Starship Gunnery feat. Without this feat, a starship
gunner takes a –4 nonproficient penalty on attack rolls with starship weapons.

For simplicity, all gunners aboard a starship have identical ranged attack
bonuses.

Range Penalty: The range penalty for a ranged weapon depends on what weapon
the starship is using and the distance to the target. All ranged weapons have
a range increment, as noted in Table: Starship Weapons.

As with character weapons, any attack from a distance of less than one range
increment is not penalized for range. However, each full range increment
causes a cumulative –2 penalty on the attack roll.

A beam weapon has a maximum range of 10 increments. A projectile weapon has an
unlimited range, since projectiles don’t lose inertia in space. Starship’s
Size Modifier: Starships are Huge, Gargantuan, or Colossal in size. Table:
Starship Sizes notes the size modifiers for ships of different sizes.
Targeting System’s Equipment Bonus: Most starships have computerized targeting
systems to help gunners train weapons on targets. A standard targeting system
provides an equipment bonus on the gunner’s attack roll depending on the
ship’s size: Huge +1, Gargantuan +2, Colossal +3. Improved targeting systems
(see Starship Sensors) grant higher bonuses. Table: Starship Sizes summarizes
the targeting system equipment bonuses for ships of different sizes.

Automatic Misses and Hits: As in character combat, a natural 1 on the attack
roll is always a miss. A natural 20 is always a hit. A natural 20 also always
threatens a critical hit (see Critical Hits, below).
