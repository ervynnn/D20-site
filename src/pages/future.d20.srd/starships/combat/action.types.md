As in character combat, starships may make attack actions, full-round actions,
move actions, and free actions. In a normal round, a starship can perform an
attack action and two move actions (in any order), two move actions, or a
single full-round action. It can also perform as many free actions as the GM
allows. In some situations (such as in the surprise round), a starship may be
limited to taking only a single attack or move action.

### Attack Action

An attack action allows a starship to make an attack or perform other similar
actions.

### Move Action

A move action allows a starship to move its tactical speed or perform some
other action that takes a similar amount of time.

If a starship moves no actual distance in a round, it can take one 500-foot
shift before, during, or after the action. The ship cannot take a 500-foot
shift if it used one or both of its move actions to move.

### Full-Round Action

A full-round action consumes all of a starshipâ€™s time during a round. The only
movement it can take during a full-round action is a 500-foot shift before,
during, or after the action. Some full-round actions do not allow you to take
a 500-foot shift. A starship can also perform free actions (see below).

### Free Action

Free actions consume a very small amount of time and effort, and over the span
of the round, their impact is so minor that they are considered free. However,
the GM puts reasonable limits on what a ship can really do for free.
