Every round, each starship gets to do something. The starships’ initiative
checks, from highest to lowest, determine the order in which they act.

### Initiative Checks

At the start of a battle, each starship makes a single initiative check. An
initiative check is a Dexterity check that uses the starship pilot’s Dexterity
modifier. (A ship without a pilot has an initiative check modifier of +0.) A
pilot with the Improved Initiative feat gets a +4 bonus on the check.

The GM determines what order starships are acting in, counting down from
highest initiative result to lowest, and each starship acts in turn. On all
following rounds, the starships act in the same order (unless a starship takes
an action that changes its initiative; see Special Initiative Actions). If two
or more starships have the same initiative check result, the starships that
are tied go in order of total initiative modifier (including Dexterity
modifier and Improved Initiative feat bonus, if applicable). If there is still
a tie, roll a die.

Flat-Footed Starships: At the start of a battle, before a starship has had a
chance to act (specifically, before its first turn in the initiative order),
it is flat-footed. It can’t apply the pilot’s Dexterity bonus to Defense while
flat-footed.
