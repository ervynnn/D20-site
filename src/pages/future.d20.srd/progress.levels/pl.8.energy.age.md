The continuing miniaturization of induction engine technology allows power
plants the size of marbles to harness the basic forces of creation. Powerful
personal force screens and energy weapons dominate the battlefield, as
projectile weapons finally disappear after ruling the battlefield for a
thousand years. Miniaturized sensors, shields, and engines allow mass
production of small, practical starfighters. At the other end of the spectrum,
advanced construction techniques allow humans to build enormous, self-
sustaining cities in space.
