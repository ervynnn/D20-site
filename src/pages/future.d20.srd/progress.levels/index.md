A Progress Level (PL) is an indication of the state of technology that exists
in a particular society or civilization (which, in a science fiction setting,
may be located on a planet other than Earth). This state of technological
development generally pervades all aspects of a culture, particularly at
higher levels (PL 5 and beyond) when long-range communication is virtually
instantaneous. Even at lower levels, it’s unlikely—but not impossible—for a
group of humans (or other sentient beings) to be at one Progress Level in some
respects and at another one in other respects.

Progress Level may vary wildly from place to place on the same world or even
the same continent.

### Purchasing Items of Lower or Higher Progress Level

Progress Levels are relative, and depending on the economics of a campaign, a
GM may choose to make certain items of a higher or lower Progress Level
unavailable, cheaper, or more expensive to purchase. For the sake of game
balance, GMs who want to make lower-PL and higher-PL items available to
characters should adjust the purchase DCs of items as follows.

  * –2 to Purchase DC for each Progress Level lower than the current Progress Level, except in the case of valuable antiques.
  * +5 to Purchase DC for equipment from the next highest Progress Level (the limit for purchasing cutting-edge technology).

### Low Progress Levels in the Future

Most modern campaigns are set at Progress Level 5. Consequently, campaigns set
in Earth’s future typically feature societies with access to Progress Level 6
technology or higher. However, characters in a futuristic setting may still
encounter technologically backward societies, possibly through the exploration
of time travel, a journey to another world, or some other plot device. For
this reason, the lower Progress Levels are included here.

### Gravity Induction

Control of gravity is one of the key features of Progress Level 7. The
development of gravitonic science and gravitonic engineering leads to a host
of miraculous devices: levitating cars, interplanetary drives that require no
reaction mass, and a wide range of military tools. Just as the application of
electricity was spurred by the discovery of the induction principle, the
creation of devices that induce gravitational energy leads to an effective
control over weight.

Gravity induction relies on the phenomenon first set forth in Einstein’s
Theory of Special Relativity: An object’s mass approaches infinity as the
object’s velocity approaches the speed of light. By using a cyclotron to
accelerate a tiny particle to near-light speed, the gravity generator creates
gravitons between the particle and the surrounding mass. These gravitons can
be siphoned off, redirected, or stored by use of the induction coil.

At PL 7, gravity inducers can be miniaturized to the size of hockey pucks for
special applications. An inducer powerful enough to negate a human’s
gravitational attraction to the Earth is about the size of a discus, while the
induction motor in a flying car requires a gravity generator about the size of
a spare tire.
