## PL 3: Age Of Reason

The Age of Reason is an era in human history when the development of ideas and
systems of thought takes precedence over technological invention. The
scientific method improves humankind’s understanding of the world.
Experimentation becomes the means by which the physical properties of nature
are systematically examined. The study of the various scientific
disciplines—chemistry, electromagnetics, medicine, biology, and
astronomy—flourishes. Instruments such as microscopes and telescopes enable
scientists to greatly extend the range of their observations and discoveries.
The new reliance on science generates waves on all levels of society.
Superstition falls away, and exploration of the world reaches its apex.
Society begins to experiment with new forms of organization, such as
democracy. Corporations and economic alliances continue to evolve.
Economically, this Progress Level is a transition from the cottage industries
of the Middle Ages to industrialization.

The cannon becomes the dominant factor in naval warfare, while massed musket
fire and horse-pulled field pieces rule the battlefield. Even the reliable bow
vanishes, replaced by the flintlock. Light melee weapons remain common.
