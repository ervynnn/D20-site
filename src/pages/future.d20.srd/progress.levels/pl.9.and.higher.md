## PL 9 And Higher

Generally, these Progress Levels are beyond reach or comprehension, although
isolated worlds or undiscovered species may exist that have access to them. In
many cases, the signature technologies of an earlier age are abandoned in
favor of more elegant and more powerful technologies.

Practical control of matter at the subatomic level, the ability to travel
through time, or the power to “fold space” to shorten travel distances may be
possible at this stage of technological development.
