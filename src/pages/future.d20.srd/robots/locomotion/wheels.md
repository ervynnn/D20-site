Wheels are somewhat more effective than treads on level ground, but the robot
moves at half speed when navigating poor surface conditions. Most wheeled
robots have four, six, or eight wheels. Robots with wheels cannot jump or
swim.

Base Speed: 30 feet.

Purchase DC: One-half the base purchase DC of the robotâ€™s frame.
