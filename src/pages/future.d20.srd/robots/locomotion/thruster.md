##  Thruster (PL 7)

Thrusters use a miniature impulse engine to produce a stream of high-energy
particles, contained and directed by magnetic fields. The exhaust is hot, but
not dangerously so. Thrusters enable the robot to fly and hover.

Base Speed: Fly 30 feet (poor).

Purchase DC: One-half the base purchase DC of the robotâ€™s frame.
