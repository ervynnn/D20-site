The robot has a propeller for air travel. It cannot travel on land without
another mode of locomotion. If for some reason the robot’s speed drops below
its base speed during any given round, it falls.

Base Speed: Fly 40 feet (clumsy).

Purchase DC: One-quarter the purchase DC of the robot’s frame.
