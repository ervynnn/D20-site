The robot follows a preset track and cannot deviate from that course. If the
robot is somehow separated from the track, it becomes effectively stationary.
The robot can maneuver over an obstacle only if the track leads over the
obstacle, but if something obstructs the track, the robot comes to a halt.

Base Speed: 10 feet.

Purchase DC: One-tenth the base purchase DC of the robot’s frame (rounded
down).
