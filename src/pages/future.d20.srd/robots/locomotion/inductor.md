## Inductor (PL 8)

Induction engine technology allows the robot to move about on a thin cushion
of artificial gravity. The thrust does not enable the robot to corner quickly,
but it can hover and float above liquid surfaces (including water).

Base Speed: 30 feet.

Purchase DC: One-half the base purchase DC of the robotâ€™s frame.
