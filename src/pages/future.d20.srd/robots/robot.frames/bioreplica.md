## Bioreplica (PL 7)

A step up from biodroids, bioreplicas are robots so convincingly lifelike that
they are virtually indistinguishable from their living counterparts. The
bioreplica’s components are made up of lightweight plastics in a synthetic
sheath that looks and feels like real flesh and skin. Bioreplicants are
restricted, and in some areas, buying or owning one is illegal.

To build a bioreplica frame from scratch, a character must succeed at two
skill checks—a Craft (mechanical) check (DC 30) and a Craft (electronic) check
(DC 30). These checks are made after investing time in the frame’s
construction: 48 hours for a Large or smaller frame or 72 hours for a Huge or
larger frame. A character without a mechanical tool kit or electrical tool kit
takes a –4 penalty on the skill check (–8 if the character has neither). The
character must also make a Wealth check against the frame’s purchase DC.

Table: Bioreplica Robot Frames provides the base purchase DC, Hit Dice, and
ability scores for factory-model bioreplica robots, as well as purchase DC
modifiers for improving ability scores.

Critical Systems: Although they are constructs, bioreplicas have vital areas
and critical systems. Consequently, they are subject to critical hits.

Lifelike Appearance: Distinguishing a bioreplica from members of its emulated
species requires a successful Spot check (DC 20). A bioreplica can use the
Disguise skill to increase the Spot check DC.

Restriction: Restricted (+2) or Illegal (+4).
