title: Liquid-State
layout: '~/layouts/MarkdownLayout.astro'
---
The liquid-state robot is a mass of metal alloy resembling liquid mercury. It
contains a molecular network of subprocessors that interpret the central
processor’s instructions to form a nearly endless variety of shapes. The
liquid metal can emulate radically different densities within the same form,
meaning that the robot can feel like flesh on the outside, but be as solid as
stone on the inside.

Being able to assume different forms does not allow the robot to duplicate
appearances or abilities; a liquid-state robot cannot change its color any
more than it can breathe fire. For example, if it assumes the shape of a
human, the robot would appear to be a human made of metal. Furthermore, a
liquid-state robot is limited to the quality of its own components. A liquid-
state robot equipped with a rotor for locomotion cannot simply change shape
and acquire a pair of legs, for example; any change must be of the same
Progress Level or lower. A liquid-state robot can, however, reattach separated
components.

To build a liquid-state “frame” from scratch, a character must succeed at two
skill checks—a Craft (mechanical) check (DC 30) and a Craft (electronic) check
(DC 30). These checks are made after investing 96 hours the frame’s
construction. A character without a mechanical tool kit or electrical tool kit
takes a –4 penalty on the skill check (–8 if the character has neither). The
character must also make a Wealth check against the frame’s purchase DC.

Table: Liquid-State Robot Frames provides the base purchase DC, Hit Dice, and
ability scores for factory-model liquid-state robots, as well as purchase DC
modifiers for improving ability scores.

Natural Armor: A liquid-state robot gains a +5 natural armor bonus to Defense.

Attacks: A liquid-state robot, regardless of its form, has two appendages
(treat as natural weapons) with which it can attack each round. It can shape
these appendages into various crude weapons as a free action; depending on
their shape, one or both weapons can deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing
damage. The robot’s size determines the amount of damage these appendages
deal: Fine 1, Diminutive 1d2 , Tiny 1d3, Small 1d4, Medium-size 1d6, Large
1d8, Huge 2d6, Gargantuan 2d8, Colossal 4d6.

Amorphous Form (Ex): Because a liquid-state robot can alter its shape and
density, it gains a +10 bonus on Escape Artist checks.

Fast Healing (Ex): A liquid-state robot has fast healing 10. This ability
ceases to function when the robot is destroyed (reduced to 0 or fewer hit
points).

Fire Vulnerability: A liquid-state robot takes 50% more damage from any fire-
based attack.

Immunities: Robots with liquid-state frames have all the normal construct
immunities, including immunity to critical hits.

Restriction: Military (+3).
