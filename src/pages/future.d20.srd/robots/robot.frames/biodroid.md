Biodroids are a step up from biomorphs, in that they can be mistaken, under
certain conditions, for what they are made to resemble. However, reasonably
close inspection reveals the presence of robotic parts and the lack of
biological parts. Purchasing a factory-model biodroid requires a license. To
build a biodroid frame from scratch, a character must succeed at two skill
checks—a Craft (mechanical) check (DC 30) and a Craft (electronic) check (DC
30). These checks are made after investing time in the frame’s construction:
48 hours for a Large or smaller frame or 72 hours for a Huge or larger frame.
A character without a mechanical tool kit or electrical tool kit takes a –4
penalty on the skill check (–8 if the character has neither). The character
must also make a Wealth check against the frame’s purchase DC.

Table: Biodroid Robot Frames provides the base purchase DC, Hit Dice, and
ability scores for factory-model biodroid robots, as well as purchase DC
modifiers for improving ability scores.

Critical Systems: Although they are constructs, biodroids have vital areas and
critical systems. Consequently, they are subject to critical hits.

Lifelike Appearance: Distinguishing a biodroid from members of its emulated
species requires a successful Spot check (DC 10). A biodroid can use the
Disguise skill to increase the Spot check DC.

Restriction: Licensed (+1).
