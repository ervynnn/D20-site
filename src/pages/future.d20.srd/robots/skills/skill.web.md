A skill web allows a robot with ordinary class levels to gain skill points as
normal for its class. The skill web expands as the robot advances in level. An
integral component of the robot, it cannot be salvaged if the droid is
destroyed. Skill webs allow a robot to benefit from skill synergy.

A skill web’s skills cannot be altered except through level advancement.

Purchase DC: One-half the base purchase DC of the robot’s frame.
