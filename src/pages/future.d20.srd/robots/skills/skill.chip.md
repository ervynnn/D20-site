##  Skill Chip (PL 5)

A skill chip enables a robot to gain up to 8 ranks in any one of the following
skills: Computer Use, Demolitions, Disable Device, Listen, Repair, Search, or
Spot. A robot can have multiple skill chips. However, skill chips do not allow
a robot to benefit from skill synergy.

A skill chip can be erased and reprogrammed with 12 hours of work and a
successful Computer Use check (DC 20 + number of skill ranks emulated by the
software).

A Techie or a Technosavant can reprogram a skill chip in 1 hour and can modify
it to hold as many ranks as he has in the emulated skill.

Purchase DC: 4 Ã— number of skill ranks.
