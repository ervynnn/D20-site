This sensor system includes a video camera with infrared capability, capable
of discerning creatures and objects by their heat signatures. It also includes
a basic audio receiver and a crude chemical sniffer (a series of filters that
detect free-floating chemical residues).

Disable Device, Forgery, and Repair checks. All other skill checks are made
without penalty.
