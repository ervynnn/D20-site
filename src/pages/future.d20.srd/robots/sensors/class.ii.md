## Class II Sensor System (PL 5)

This sensor system includes a video camera with infrared capability, capable
of discerning creatures and objects by their heat signatures. It also includes
a basic audio receiver and a crude chemical sniffer (a series of filters that
detect free-floating chemical residues).

A robot with a Class II sensor system takes a â€“4 penalty on all Demolitions,
Disable Device, Forgery, and Repair checks. All other skill checks are made
without penalty.

Type: Audio, Olfactory, Visual.

Purchase DC: 15.
