## Sensors

Robots are unable to perceive their surroundings without a sensor system of
some kind. Without sensors, they are effectively blind and deaf, and they
suffer penalties on certain checks—if they can attempt them at all.

Sight: A robot without visual sensors suffers a –4 penalty on all skill checks
and cannot make Spot checks.

Sound: A robot without audio sensors suffers a –2 penalty on all skill checks
and cannot make Listen checks.

Touch: A robot without tactile sensors suffers a –4 penalty on all
Demolitions, Disable Device, Forgery, and Repair checks.

Smell: A robot without olfactory sensors suffers no particular penalties.

Taste: A robot without gustatory sensors suffers no particular penalties.

To build a sensor system from scratch, a character must succeed at a Craft
(electrical) check (DC 30) after investing 60 hours in its assembly. A
character without an electrical tool kit takes a –4 penalty on the skill
check. The character must also make a Wealth check against the sensor system’s
purchase DC.

Robot sensor systems are further separated by type and purchase DC:

Type: The type of sensors (visual, audio, tactile, olfactory, gustatory)
included in the system.

Purchase DC: The cost of the sensor system.

Restriction: A sensor system does not require a special license to purchase.
