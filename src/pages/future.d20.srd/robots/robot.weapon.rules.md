##  Robot Weapon Rules

A robot can be armed with manipulators, handheld weapons, mounted weapons, or
any combination of the three. However, during any given round of attacks, it
must choose whether to attack with its manipulators, handheld weapons, or
mounted weapons, as it cannot switch between them during the same turn.

Manipulators are considered natural weapons, and using them does not provoke
attacks of opportunity.

A robot armed with handheld weapons follows the normal rules of combat,
suffering the usual penalties for two-weapon fighting.

A robot armed with multiple mounted weapons gains one primary attack with a
mounted weapon of its choice; the rest of its mounted weapons are treated as
secondary attacks (â€“5 penalty on the attack roll). Using a mounted ranged
weapon provokes attacks of opportunity.
