The Armed Police Escort (APE) robot is designed to help police deal with civil
disobedience and unrest in the urban jungle. This robot resembles a hulking,
apelike man with thick arms and legs, clad headto- toe in interlocking
duralloy plates. The robot’s hands can be used for grappling or carrying
items. It usually carries an OICW assault rifle. In addition, it has a mini-
grenade launcher (with a compartment for concussion grenades) mounted in its
left forearm and a laser pistol mounted in its right forearm. The APE robot
cannot use its mounted weapons if it is grappling.
