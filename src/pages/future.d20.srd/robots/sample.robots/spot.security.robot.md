This robot looks like a man-sized, mechanical guard dog with four powerful
legs, wicked jaws, and resilium armor covering its body. It growls and barks
at intruders with the aid of a vocalizer. “Spot” functions as a robotic
watchdog and can only be mistaken for an actual dog at distances of 100 feet
