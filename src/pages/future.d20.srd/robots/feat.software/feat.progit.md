## Feat Progit (PL 6)

Sophisticated emulation software encased in a thin but durable plastic casing,
a feat progit is installed in the robotâ€™s central processing unit and enables
the robot to gain a single feat.

A robot can have a number of feat progits equal to 1 + one-third its Hit Dice
(rounded down).

A feat progit can be erased and reprogrammed with 12 hours of work and a
successful Computer Use check (DC 30).

Purchase DC: 20.
