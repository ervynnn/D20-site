##  Feat Net (PL 7)

A feat net consists of a series of interlocking programs that allow the robot
to emulate multiple feats. A feat net holds as many as four feats.

A robot can have multiple feat nets, but the total number of feats a robot can
have installed cannot exceed 1 + one-third the robot’s Hit Dice (rounded
down).

The biggest advantage of the feat net over the feat progit is that you only
make one Wealth check to purchase a feat net, whereas buying individual feat
progits requires separate Wealth checks. A feat net can be reprogrammed one
feat at a time. Replacing one feat with another requires 12 hours of work and
a successful Computer Use check (DC 30).

Purchase DC: 15 (one feat), 17 (two feats), 19 (three feats), 20 (four feats).
