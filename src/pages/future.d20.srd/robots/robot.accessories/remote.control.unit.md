Referred to colloquially as a “remcon,” this handheld, self-powered control
stick has a small video screen and audio receiver built into it. It also comes
in the form of a mechanical gauntlet worn on the hand.

The remcon allows its operator to control a specific robot from afar. For it
to work, the robot must be equipped with an AV transmitter and a robolink
adjusted to the same frequency as the remote control unit.

Using a remcon to activate or deactivate a robot is an attack or move action.
Using it to make the robot move, attack, or use a skill is a full-round action
for the operator.

Purchase DC: 15.

Restriction: None.
