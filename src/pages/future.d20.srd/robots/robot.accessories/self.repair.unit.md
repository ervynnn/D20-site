A self-repair unit enables a robot to repair itself by replacing damaged parts
with cannibalized or replicated ones. A robot with a self-repair unit can
spend 1 hour repairing itself; this automatically restores 1d10 points of
damage (no Repair check necessary). A robot cannot use this unit to repair
another robot.
