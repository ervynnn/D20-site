## Inertial Inhibitor (PL 7)

The inertial inhibitor generates a thin magnetic field that radiates out from
the robot, slowing the velocity of potentially damaging weapons and
projectiles. The robot gains damage reduction 5/energy (the inertial inhibitor
does not protect against attacks that deal acid, cold, electricity, fire, or
sonic/concussion damage). The inertial inhibitor feeds on of the robotâ€™s
internal power source.

Purchase DC: 29.

Restriction: Military (+3).
