title: Inertial Inhibitor
layout: '~/layouts/MarkdownLayout.astro'
---
The inertial inhibitor generates a thin magnetic field that radiates out from
the robot, slowing the velocity of potentially damaging weapons and
projectiles. The robot gains damage reduction 5/energy (the inertial inhibitor
does not protect against attacks that deal acid, cold, electricity, fire, or
sonic/concussion damage). The inertial inhibitor feeds on of the robot’s
internal power source.
