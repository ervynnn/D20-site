The RRU enables a robot to repair itself or another robot by replacing damaged
parts with replicated new ones. In the latter case, the robot making the
repairs must be adjacent to the damaged robot. The robot must spend a full-
round action to repair itself or another robot; this automatically restores
1d10 points of damage (no Repair check necessary).

Purchase DC: 28.
