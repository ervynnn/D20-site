title: Tool Mount

Any robot with an armature, biomorph, biodroid, or bioreplica frame can be
equipped with a tool mount. Liquid-state robots, due to their amorphous
nature, cannot have tool mounts.

This mount is usually attached to the end of a robotic appendage and sports a
single tool. A tool mount easily adjusts to house different kinds of tools,
but it can hold only one tool at any given time.

The robot’s internal power source powers the tool, if necessary.

The tool can be up to one size category larger than the robot’s size category;
for example, a Medium-size robot’s tool mount can bear a Large or smaller
tool. The tool can be any general item.

Purchase DC: 1 + the purchase DC of the tool.

Restriction: None.
