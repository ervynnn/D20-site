## Self-Destruct System (PL 6)

Designed for robots in military and espionage roles, self-destruct systems
ensure that the robot cannot be captured, analyzed, and reprogrammed.
Installing a robot self-destruct system requires a Demolitions check (DC 20)
instead of a Craft (mechanical) check; if the Demolitions check fails by 10 or
more, the system detonates, destroying the robot and possibly harming others
nearby.

The default self-destruct system is rigged to detonate when the robot is
reduced to 0 hit points. With a second Demolitions check (DC 30), the system
can be modified to detonate when the robot has a higher number of hit points
remaining (5 hit points, for example).

The self-destruct system obliterates the robot regardless of how many hit
points it has left. A robot destroyed by its own self-destruct system has no
salvageable parts.

The robot’s self-destruction triggers an explosion of shrapnel that deals
collateral slashing damage to creatures in squares adjacent to the robot. A
successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the robot’s HD) reduces the damage by
half. Table: Robot Self-Destruct Systems shows the amount of collateral damage
(and the system’s purchase DC) based on the robot’s size.

Purchase DC: See Table: Robot Self-Destruct Systems.

Restriction: Military (+3).
