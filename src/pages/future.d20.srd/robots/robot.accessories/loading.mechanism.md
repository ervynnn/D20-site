title: Loading Mechanism

A loading mechanism allows a robot to reload a single handheld weapon as a
full-round action. The mechanism can hold enough ammunition to reload the
weapon three times. The mechanism works with weapons that use box ammunition,
speed-loaders (but not loose bullets), a grenade launcher round, some sort of
fuel tank (such as a flamethrower) or power cell.

A robot can have multiple loading mechanisms—one for each weapon it carries.

Purchase DC: 12 (doesn’t include ammunition).

Restriction: None.
