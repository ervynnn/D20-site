A remote audio-visual unit consists of a video camera and microphone connected
to the robot’s visual and audio sensors, with a transmitter to send the
information to a computer or a remote control unit (see Remote Control Unit,
below). The AV transmitter includes a transmitter with an effective range of
1,000 feet. This unit does not allow a remote operator to control the robot
(but see Robolink, below). It merely allows the operator to see and hear what
the robot sees and hears.

Purchase DC: 16.

Restriction: None.
