title: Ability Upgrades

Heroic and nonheroic robots can receive structural and programming upgrades
that increase their ability scores. (Heroic robots can also improve their
mental ability scores by gaining levels, much as organic characters do; see
Robots as Heroes for details.)

A robot can receive multiple upgrades to the same ability score. Robots with
armature and biomorph frames have no Intelligence score and therefore cannot
receive upgrades to Intelligence. No robot can receive an upgrade to
Constitution, since robots do not have Constitution scores.

Upgrades to physical abilities (Strength and Dexterity) always entail a refit
or reconstruction and require a factory, workshop, or other facility. Upgrades
to mental abilities (Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) are handled by using
a computer to reprogram or add new subroutines to the robot’s brain, neural
network, or central processing unit.

To perform a Strength or Dexterity upgrade from scratch, a character must have
access to a workshop or other suitable facility. Acquiring the necessary
components for the upgrade requires a Wealth check against the upgrade’s
purchase DC. After 24 hours spent performing the upgrade, the character must
succeed at a Craft (mechanical) check (DC 25). A character without a
mechanical tool kit takes a –4 penalty on the skill check.

To perform an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma upgrade, a character must
first acquire the necessary system components with a successful Wealth check
(against the upgrade’s purchase DC). The character must then succeed at a
Computer Use check (DC 30) after 1 hour spent reprogramming the robot.

Purchase DC: The cost of the upgrade.
