##  Drifter

Drifters are aimless wanderers and worldwise jacks-of-all-trades who move

them elsewhere. Along the way, they learn strange customs and pick up
interesting and diverse skills.

skill you select is already a class skill, you gain a +1 competence bonus on
checks using that skill.

Forgery (Int), Gamble (Wis), Gather Information (Cha), Hide (Dex), Knowledge
(streetwise) (Int), Navigate (Int), Sleight of Hand (Dex).
