## Scavenger

Scavengers turn society’s wreckage and discarded trash into useful tools or
items for trade, and if they’re lucky, their endeavors might even yield one or
two objects of special value. They effortlessly navigate and strip clean the
most treacherous places, and their playgrounds are abandoned space stations,
gutted buildings, and smoking battlefields.
