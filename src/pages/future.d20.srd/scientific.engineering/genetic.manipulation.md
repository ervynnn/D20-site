## Genetic Manipulation

Genetic manipulation becomes possible at PL 5 when technology advances enough
to create electron microscopes, computer-aided imagery, and the tools to
delicately examine and manipulate the tiniest building blocks of lifeâ€”genes.
At this point, scientists are able to experiment with DNA, gene splicing, and
other activities that eventually lead to more advanced techniques.
