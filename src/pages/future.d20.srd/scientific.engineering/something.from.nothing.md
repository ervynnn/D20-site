## Something From Nothing

Almost incomprehensible to modern science, one final means of replication
should also be considered. Creating an object literally from nothing is a
concept that cannot fit into modern scientific understanding. The laws of
conservation of energy and the idea that there is a finite amount of matter in
the universe dictate that creating an object without a basic set of materials
is impossible. However, some incredibly advanced societies may be able to do
just that, and matter replication without a basic material like protomatter
might be entirely feasibly and evidence of how far that societyâ€™s technology
is beyond all others.
