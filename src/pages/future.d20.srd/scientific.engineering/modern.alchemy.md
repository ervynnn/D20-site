##  Modern Alchemy

One source of matter replication is reminiscent of the ancient technique k
nown as alchemy. Replicators that rely on alchemy as their primary means of
producing new objects transform one element into another to create the final
object. These replicators require a basic object to transform; in most cases,
the object to transform must have the same mass as the desired object. This
type of replication relies heavily on the science of cold fusion and the
ability to alter the most basic building blocks of matter. This form of
replication is one of the earliest discovered and requires the most effort to
function.
