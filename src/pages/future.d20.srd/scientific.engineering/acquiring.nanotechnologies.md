In most settings, nanotechnology is not some cheap technology that can be
picked up off the street. While it is feasible that some campaign settings
could have nanotechnology so common that any character could go to the local
nanotech clinic and receive the latest nanite injection, it is more likely
that obtaining nanotechnology for personal use is more difficult than simply
dropping down the cash. Gamemasters might limit the availability of
nanotechnology by not only making nanocolonies expensive to purchase, but also
requiring the character to obtain permission or a permit.

Conversely, the Gamemaster may wish to dole out nanocolonies as a reward for
completing a task, or might determine that a nanite injection would be
standard procedure for a particular organization.
