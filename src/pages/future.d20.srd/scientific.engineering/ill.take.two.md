## I’ll Take Two

One of the simplest processes using matter replication is the duplication of
an existing object. In fact, duplication machines are far more common in most
settings than full-fledged replicators because they don’t require the storage
of massive amounts of blueprints.

Replacing the databank of blueprints are advanced sensors that analyze the
construction of an object and transform the collected data into a blueprint of
the object. Once the scanning process is complete, the replicator produces a
copy of the desired object just as quickly as creating it from a stored
blueprint. The duplication machine does not store blueprints, and so each
object must be scanned before duplication can occur.
