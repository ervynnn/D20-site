While matter replication can duplicate inanimate objects from the proper
blueprint, creating a living being is another issue altogether. The complexity
of a living being is far beyond that of even the most complicated machine and
computer; attempting to recreate a living being using a replicator almost
always meets with failure.

Moral and ethical concerns about creating new life aside, only the most
advanced societies have developed technology capable of mapping out something
so complex as the mind of an animal. Plant life duplication is somewhat
simpler, but still complex, and duplicating animal life is a task that can
result in horrible deformities if not perfected.
