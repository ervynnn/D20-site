“Nocturnal” is an acquired template that can be added to any humanoid or
monstrous humanoid (referred to hereafter as the character). It uses all the
character’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

The nocturnal template allows the character to function in darkness the way
normal humans do in the light. A character acquires the nocturnal template by
undergoing a course of gene therapy (see More Human than Human). The regimen
requires 25 successful Fortitude saving throws (DC 20).

Special Qualities: A nocturnal retains all the special qualities of the
character and gains the additional special qualities listed below.

Darkvision (Ex): Nocturnals have darkvision with a range of 60 feet.

Light Sensitivity (Ex): Nocturnals are blinded by sunlight, flashlights,
fluorescent lights, halogen lamps, and other sources of bright illumination.
They can counter the blindness and see normally by wearing dark-tinted
sunglasses or tinted visors.

Skills: Same as the character, with a +2 species bonus on Listen and Move
Silently checks.

Feats: Nocturnals gain Blind-Fight as a bonus feat.

Advancement: By character class.
