## Gene Screening

Using advanced PL 5 techniques, it is possible for scientists to learn a great
deal about an organism even while it is gestating. By taking a sample of a
developing creatureâ€™s DNA, they can tell what physical and mental qualities it
is liable to possess, what diseases or conditions it is predisposed toward,
and even what its emotional temperament is likely to be.
