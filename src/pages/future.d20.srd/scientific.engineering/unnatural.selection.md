Gene therapy as practiced at PL 5—targeting specific cells for localized
modification—affects only the patient directly receiving the treatment. She is
unable to pass the modifications on to her offspring. However, once the
technology reaches the point in PL 6 that it can imbue the subject with new
special qualities, the subject has been changed at a basic genetic level and
the traits may be passed along to children.

This process has the potential to create an entirely new race— winged humans,
for example. And if the genetic manipulation is extensive enough that the
subject’s DNA is no longer compatible with naturally occurring DNA—if she can
no longer mate with normal m embers her own kind—the subject has actually been
transformed into a new species. Such manipulation generally is not possible
until PL 7.

The most common use for such extensive genetic manipulation is to create
humans or other creatures who are capable of surviving in conditions that
would normally be deadly.
