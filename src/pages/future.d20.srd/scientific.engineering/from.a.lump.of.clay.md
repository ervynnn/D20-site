Another type of matter replication transforms a substance known as protomatter
into the desired object. In many respects, protomatter resembles the basic
shapechanging nanocolony known as UFog (see above) because it can be
transformed into almost any object. Protomatter is a generic base from which
all other matter is replicated; it can be transformed and molded as the
replicator’s computer system sees fit with no need to transform one element
into another. The use of protomatter is one of the most efficient forms of
matter replication and has the beneficial side effect of being environmentally
safe.
