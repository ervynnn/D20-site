##  Performing Experiments

Science is not a process that happens quickly, although key developments often
happen accidentally, reshaping the knowledge base overnight. Performing basic
experiments in genetic manipulation realistically would take a researcher
months (and more likely years) of effort. However, once the scientific
groundwork is laid, tests and procedures can be attempted more rapidly.

In general, testing any single hypothesis about a procedure, or discovering
the effects of performing a specific genetic modification, requires 3d10 days
and a successful Research check. The DC for this check should be no lower than
20 and can be as high as the GM prefers. Scientific research is painstaking
and even experiments based on solid theories must often be attempted several
times before providing a conclusive result.

If the GM is running a more cinematic campaign where scientists develop
theories and produce solutions in quick succession, she may opt to change the
time required to 3d10 hours and the Research DC to a minimum of 15.
