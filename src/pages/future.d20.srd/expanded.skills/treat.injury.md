##  Treat Injury (Wis)

This skill can be used to treat members of other species, provided they are
neither constructs nor undead.

Check: For all uses of this skill except surgery, the skill check’s DCs are
unchanged.

Performing surgery on creatures of a type different from your own carries a –8
penalty. The Surgery feat reduces the penalty to –4, while the Xenomedic feat
negates the penalty entirely.

Special: The Treat Injury skill cannot be used on nonliving or inorganic
creatures, such as constructs or undead.
