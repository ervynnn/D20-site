You can use this skill to repair vehicles, starships, mecha, cybernetic
attachments, and constructs (including robots). You can also use the Repair
skill to safely remove the “brain” of a destroyed robot.

Check: Repairing damage to a vehicle, starship, or mecha takes 1 hour of work,
a mechanical tool kit, and a proper facility such as a workshop or hangar bay.
(Without a tool kit, you take a –4 penalty on your Repair check.) At the end
of the hour, make a Repair check (DC 20). Success repairs 2d6 points of
damage. If damage remains, you may continue to make repairs for as many hours
as it takes to restore the vehicle or starship to full hit points.

The same rules apply to robots, other constructs, and cybernetic attachments,
except that each successful application of the Repair skill restores 1d10
points of damage (instead of 2d6), and the Repair check is more difficult to
achieve (DC 30).

This skill may also be used to transplant the “brain” of a destroyed robot
into a similar but intact robot frame. See the Robot Resurrection for more
information on robotic brain transplants.

Special: A vehicle, starship, cybernetic attachment, mecha, robot, or other
construct that is reduced to 0 hp cannot be repaired. It can be salvaged for
parts, however (see the Salvage feat description).
