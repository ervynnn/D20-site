In a campaign that features space travel or dimensional travel, you can use
the Navigate skill to plot a course between planets, star systems, or
dimensions.

Check: The rules for plotting a course over a great distance work as described
in the Navigate skill description. Aboard a starship, you need a functional
Class II sensor array (or better) to plot a course through space. You don’t
need to make a Navigate check when traveling along a pre-established space
route or passing through a dimension gate with a pre-calibrated destination.

Time: Plotting a course is a full-round action.
