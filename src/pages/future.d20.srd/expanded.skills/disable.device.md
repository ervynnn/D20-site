##  Disable Device (Int)

You can use this skill to disable a robot or external cybernetic attachment.

Check: Disabling a robot is a full-round action and requires a successful
Disable Device check (DC 30). The robot must be pinned before the check can be
made.

Disabling an external cybernetic attachment is a full-round action and
requires a successful Disable Device check (DC 30). The creature to which the
cybernetic unit is attached must be pinned before the check can be made. You
cannot disable internal cybernetic attachments.

Special: A disabled robot or disabled external cybernetic attachment can be
re-enabled with a successful Repair check (see Repair).
