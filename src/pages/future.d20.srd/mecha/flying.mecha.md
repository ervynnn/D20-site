The vehicle rules are entirely appropriate for ground cars and other normal
modes of transportation; however, even a clumsy mecha is more maneuverable
than a normal vehicle.

On the ground, mecha move as characters. They can turn at any time, move in
any direction, and stop on a dime. In the air, though, they are more limited.
Most flying mecha have to s low down to make a turn, and many are limited to
fairly wide turns and must maintain a minimum forward speed. Each flying mecha
has a maneuverability rating, as shown on Table: Flight Maneuverability. A
mecha’s flight systems determine its maneuverability.

Minimum Forward Speed: If a flying mecha fails to maintain its minimum forward
speed, it must land at the end of its movement. If it is too high above the
ground to land, it falls straight down, descending 150 feet in the first round
of falling. If this distance brings it to the ground, it takes falling damage.
If the fall doesn’t bring the mecha to the ground, the operator must succeed
at a Pilot check (DC 20) to recover. Otherwise, it falls another 300 feet. If
it hits the ground, it takes falling damage. Otherwise, it has another chance
to recover on its next turn.

**Hover** : The ability to stay in one place while airborne.  
**Fly Backward** : The ability to fly backward.  
**Reverse** : A mecha with good maneuverability uses up 5 feet of its speed to
start flying backward.  
**Turn** : How much the flying mecha can turn after covering the stated
distance.  
**Turn in Place** : A mecha with good or average maneuverability can “spend”
some of its speed to turn in place.  
**Maximum Turn** : How much the mecha can turn in any one space.  
**Up Angle** : The angle at which the mecha can ascend.  
**Up Speed** : How fast the mecha can ascend.  
**Down Angle** : The angle at which the mecha can descend.  
**Down Speed** : A flying mecha can descend at twice its normal flying speed.

Between Down and Up: An average, poor, or clumsy mecha must fly level for a
minimum distance after descending and before ascending. Any flying mecha can
begin descending after an ascent without an intervening distance.
