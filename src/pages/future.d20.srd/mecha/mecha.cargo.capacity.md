##  Mecha Cargo Capacity

Although they are not built to haul cargo, mecha superstructures have a
limited amount of storage space. Table: Mecha Cargo Capacity lists the maximum
weight in additional cargo (not including crew, weapons, or other integrated
equipment) a mecha can transport in its internal storage compartments, as well
as the maximum size of an object that will fit inside one of these internal
compartments.
