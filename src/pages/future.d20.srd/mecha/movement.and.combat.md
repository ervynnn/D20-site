Combat between mecha is conducted much as it is between characters. Characters
operating mecha are simply much larger and stronger than they would otherwise
be, and they can wield truly frightening weapons. However, they still obey the
essential rules of movement and combat. They still threaten squares within
their reach, take move actions and attack actions, duck behind cover to gain a
bonus to Defense, and so forth. In some respects, however, mecha movement and
combat differs from character movement and combat. The following sections
describe specific situations that arise when mecha maneuver and clash on the
battlefield.
