## Mecha Body Size

Mecha bodies come in Large, Huge, Gargantuan, and Colossal sizes. A mecha’s
size determines how many equipment slots (places where weapons and additional
equipment can be installed) it has, and how well it measures up in combat. See
Table: Mecha Sizes for a summary of this information.

**Size Modifier** : Apply this modifier to the mecha’s attack rolls and to its
Defense.  
**Equipment Slots** : The number of locations where weapons and other mecha
equipment can be installed.  
**Hit Points** : The mecha’s hit points, and the number of hit points the
mecha provides its operator.  
**Base Speed** : The mecha’s base land speed. Certain types of armor reduce
base speed (see Mecha Armor).  
**Height** : The mecha’s height in feet.  
**Weight** : The mecha’s weight in pounds.  
**Fighting Space** : The mecha’s fighting space.  
**Reach** : The mecha’s reach, even without weapons.  
**Purchase DC** : The base purchase DC of the mecha without armor, weapons,
and other equipment.  
**Restriction** : The level of license required to purchase the mecha legally.

### Large Mecha

Essentially big suits of armor, Large mecha excel in urban battlefields and
starship boarding actions, where they move through buildings and corridors to
find the enemy. Large mecha are the easiest to operate. However, they can’t
carry the intense array of weapons that bigger mecha can, nor are they as
strong or durable.

Combat Statistics: A Large mecha adds a +8 equipment bonus to a character’s
Strength score. It imposes a –1 size penalty on attack rolls and to Defense.
Depending on the material used, a Large mecha has 100 bonus hit points, which
are added to the character’s total and subtracted first when the character
takes damage. It takes a –4 penalty on Hide checks.

A Large mecha has a single slam attack that deals 1d8 points of damage (plus
the character’s increased Strength modifier). Its reach is 10 feet, and its
base speed is 30 feet.

Base Purchase DC: 40.

Equipment Slots: A Large mecha has 7 equipment slots available. These slots
are located as follows.

**Helmet** : 1 slot.  
**Back** : 1 slot.  
**Left arm** : 1 slot.  
**Right arm** : 1 slot.  
**Shoulders** : 1 slot.  
**Torso** : 1 slot.  
**Boots** : 1 slot.

### Huge Mecha

Common weapons on the futuristic battlefield, Huge mecha offer a solid balance
between cost, agility, and sheer bulk. They perform well in any combat
environment, but they favor locations with some variation in terrain. In the
wide-open desert or depths of outer space, they can fall prey larger mecha.

Combat Statistics: A Huge mecha adds a +16 equipment bonus to a character’s
Strength score. It imposes a –2 size penalty on attack rolls and to Defense.
Depending on the material used, a Huge mecha has 200 bonus hit points, which

**Torso** : 1 slot.  
**Belt** : 1 slot.

### Gargantuan Mecha

Gargantuan mecha are highly experimental in PL 6 societies, but quite common
at PL 7. Units of this size are titans of the battlefield, able to destroy
almost anything they can hit. Gargantuan mecha are common in outer space
environments but are often too expensive and unwieldy for planet-based
missions.

character’s Strength score and a –2 penalty to Dexterity. It imposes a –4 size
penalty on attack rolls and to Defense. Depending on the material used, a

### Colossal Mecha

Colossal mecha do not exist in PL 6 societies and are rare sights even at PL
7. Only at PL 8 do they leave the experimental stage and enter the battlefield
in respectable numbers. Massive juggernauts, Colossal mecha represent the
epitome of futuristic warfare, with firepower sufficient to destroy starships
or level entire city blocks. They typically serve as mobile artillery and
walking weapon platforms.

Combat Statistics: A Colossal mecha adds a +32 equipment bonus to a
character’s Strength score and a –4 penalty to Dexterity. It imposes a –8 size
penalty on attack rolls and to Defense. Depending on the material used, a
