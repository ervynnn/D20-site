## Cockpit Access

It takes a full-round action to climb into a mechaâ€™s cockpit and a move action
to activate its various systems so it can move and fight. It takes a full-
round action to get out of a mecha unless an HV-5 Haven escape pod or
similarly expeditious device is used (see Miscellaneous Equipment).
