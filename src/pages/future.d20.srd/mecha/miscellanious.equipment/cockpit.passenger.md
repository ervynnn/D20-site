title: Cockpit, Passenger
layout: '~/layouts/MarkdownLayout.astro'
---
This extra cockpit merely provides a comfortable place inside the mecha for a
Small or Medium-size passenger to sit. The passenger can’t do anything other
than observe the surroundings (seeing exactly what the mecha’s operator sees),
communicate privately with the operator and publicly over open frequencies,
and leave the cockpit as a full-round action. As a move action, the operator
can prevent any of the above by shutting off the cameras, locking the hatch,
and so on.
