## Miscellaneous Equipment

This section describes various other pieces of mecha equipment that don’t fall
neatly under the other categories, including a variety of electrical systems.
Building a system from scratch requires a character to make a Wealth check
against the system’s purchase DC, invest time in its assembly, and succeed at
a Craft (electrical), Craft (mechanical), or Craft (structural) check (DC
30)—whichever seems most appropriate given the type of equipment. See the
Craft skill description for further guidance. A character without the
appropriate electrical or mechanical tool kit takes a –4 penalty on the skill
check.
