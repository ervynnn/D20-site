title: HV-5 Haven Escape Pod
layout: '~/layouts/MarkdownLayout.astro'
---
The HV-5 Haven escape pod jettisons the cockpit and the mecha operator from
the rest of the mecha (typically because the mecha is about to be destroyed).
The operator can activate it as a move action and move normally at the Haven’s
fly speed. The Haven can also be activated as a free action, in which case it
flies under the operator’s direction up to its fly speed, but can move no
farther that round.

The Haven escape pod has a fly speed of 90 feet (clumsy), 50 hit points,
hardness 10, and a Defense of 18. Three rounds after it jettisons from the
mecha, it runs out of fuel, landing or crashing as appropriate.
