## Crackerjack Neural Link (PL 8)

This unit links the operator’s brain directly to the mecha, making it feel
less like a machine and more like an extension of the operator’s body. While
driving or piloting the mecha, the operator gains a +2 bonus on initiative
checks. In addition, the operator can use any of his nonmecha-specific feats
while operating a mecha. (This ability does not grant the operator any new
feats.)

**Equipment Slots** : 1, must be helmet or cranium.  
**Activation** : None.  
**Range** : Personal.  
**Target** : You.  
**Duration** : Persistent.  
**Saving Throw** : None.  
**Purchase DC** : 15 + one-quarter the mecha’s base purchase DC.  
**Restriction** : Restricted (+2).
