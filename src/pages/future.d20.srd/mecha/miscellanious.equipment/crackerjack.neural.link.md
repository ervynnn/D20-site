This unit links the operator’s brain directly to the mecha, making it feel
less like a machine and more like an extension of the operator’s body. While
driving or piloting the mecha, the operator gains a +2 bonus on initiative
checks. In addition, the operator can use any of his nonmecha-specific feats
while operating a mecha. (This ability does not grant the operator any new
feats.)
