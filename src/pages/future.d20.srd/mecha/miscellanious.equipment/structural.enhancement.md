## Structural Enhancement (PL 7)

Significant advances in engineering inspire a series of modifications to the
mecha’s superstructure, granting it an additional 50 hit points. A mecha can
undergo structural enhancement multiple times, gaining 50 additional hit
points each time, but it can never have more than twice its starting hit
points (as noted in Table: Mecha Sizes).

A character may structurally enhance a mecha with a successful Craft
(structural) check (DC 30) after devoting an amount of time that varies
depending on the mecha’s size: Large 30 hours, Huge 60 hours, Gargantuan 120
hours, Colossal 240 hours. A character attempting the procedure without a
mechanical tool kit takes a –4 penalty on the skill check.

Each time a mecha is structurally enhanced, it loses one equipment slot.
