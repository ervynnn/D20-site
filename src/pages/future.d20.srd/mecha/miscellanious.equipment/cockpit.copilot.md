## Cockpit, Copilot (PL 5)

This extra cockpit provides a comfortable station inside the mecha for a Small
or Medium-size copilot. A copilot has the ability to fire the mecha’s ranged
weapons, perform active scans using the mecha’s sensor systems, or aid the
pilot’s attacks and skill checks (using the aid another action). Melee combat,
defense, and movement remain under the control of the mecha’s operator in the
main cockpit. A copilot doesn’t grant the mecha additional attacks in a round,
and only one character may fire each ranged weapon each round. The mecha
operator or copilot can transfer weapon control as a free action.

As a move action, the mecha’s operator can lock out one or more copilot
cockpits, shutting off the cameras, locking the hatches, and so on.

It takes a successful Computer Use check (DC 25 if the operator is disabled,
35 if the operator is still active) to switch overall control of the mecha to
a copilot cockpit.
