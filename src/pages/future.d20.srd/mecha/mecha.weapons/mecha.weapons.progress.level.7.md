### Chrysanthemum Laser Array (PL 6)

A barrage of phosphorus lasers deals massive damage to the mecha’s
surroundings, making this a weapon of last resort. Everything within 60 feet
of the mecha (but not the mecha itself) takes 16d8 points of fire damage,
after which the lasers burn themselves out. A successful Reflex save (DC 25)
means the target takes only half damage.

Once fired, the Chrysanthemum burst array becomes nonfunctional and must be
replaced.

**Equipment Slots** : 1.  
**Activation** : Attack action.  
**Range:** 0 feet.  
**Area** : 60-foot-radius burst centered on you.  
**Duration** : Instantaneous.  
**Saving Throw** : Reflex half (DC 25).  
**Purchase DC** : 26.  
**Restriction** : Military (+3).

### M-300 Rhino Mass Cannon (PL 7)

The M-300 Rhino mass cannon charges a small bit of matter with incredible
gravitational energy, then hurls it at the target, where its increased
gravitational pull causes it to slam into the target like a wrecking ball. The
weapon deals 8d12 points of ballistic damage on a successful hit.

**Equipment Slots** : 2, including hand (or arm if Large), arm, or shoulders.  
**Activation** : Attack action.  
**Range Increment** : 100 feet.  
**Target:** Single target within 1,000 feet.  
**Duration** : Instantaneous.  
**Saving Throw** : None.  
**Purchase DC** : 29.  
**Restriction** : Military (+3).

### PS-25 Tiger Claws (PL 7)

An improvement over the PS-15 Panther claws, PS-25 Tiger claws have
monofilament edges that shear through armor plating like knives through
butter. They can be extended or retracted as a free action.

The claws convert the mecha’s slam attack into a claw attack that deals
slashing damage. The amount of damage is based on the mecha’s size: Large 6d8,
Huge 8d8, Gargantuan 10d8, and Colossal 12d8. The claws have a critical threat
range of 19–20.

The claws are one size category smaller than the mecha’s size category.

**Equipment Slots** : 1, must be hand (or arm if Large).  
**Activation** : Attack action.  
**Range:** Touch.  
**Target:** Single target within reach.  
**Duration** : Instantaneous.  
**Saving Throw** : None.  
**Purchase DC** : 10 + one-quarter the mecha’s base purchase DC.  
**Restriction** : None.

### Tsunami 480 Plasma Cannon (PL 7)

The Tsunami 280 plasma cannon has two aperture settings: focused beam and
wide-angle beam. The mecha operator can switch between settings as a move
action. The focused beam setting deals 12d6 points of fire damage with a
successful ranged attack, and it has a critical threat range of 20. On the
wide-angle setting, the weapon automatically hits everything within a 60-foot
cone for 12d6 points of fire damage, but those in the area can make a Reflex
save (DC 19) to reduce the damage by half. Critical hits aren’t possible on
the wide-angle setting.

**Equipment Slots** : 3, including hand (or arm if Large), arm, shoulders, or
visor.  
**Activation** : Attack action.  
**Range Increment** /**Range:** 150 feet (focused beam), or 60 feet (wide-
angle).  
**Target/Area** : Single target within 1,500 feet, or 60-foot cone.  
**Duration** : Instantaneous.  
**Saving Throw** : None or Reflex half (DC 19; see text).  
**Purchase DC** : 25.  
**Restriction** : Military (+3).

### XJ-A Python Electro-Whip (PL 7)

The XJ-A Python is an electrified cable with embedded servomotors that wrap
around the target. The Python deals electricity damage according to the
mecha’s size: Large 2d10, Huge 4d10, Gargantuan 6d10, and Colossal 8d10. The
Python has an extra 15 feet of reach.

When using the Python, you get a +2 equipment bonus on your opposed attack
roll when attempting to disarm an opponent (including the roll to avoid being
disarmed if you fail to disarm your opponent).

Because the electro-whip can wrap around an enemy’s leg or other limb, you can
make a trip attack with it by succeeding at a melee touch attack. If you are
tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop or detach the Python
electro-whip to avoid being tripped.

The electro-whip’s size category is the same as the mecha’s size category.

**Equipment Slots** : 1, must be hand (or arm if Large).  
**Activation** : Attack action.  
**Range:** Touch.  
**Target:** Single target within reach.  
**Duration** : Instantaneous.  
**Saving Throw** : None.  
**Purchase DC** : 10 + one-quarter the mecha’s base purchase DC.  
**Restriction** : Restricted (+2).
