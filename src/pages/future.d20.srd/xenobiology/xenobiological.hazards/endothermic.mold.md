##  Endothermic Mold (CR 2)

Endothermic mold feeds on warmth, siphoning heat from anything around it. A
patch of endothermic mold is red-brown in color and 5 feet in diameter, and
the temperature is always cold in a 30- foot radius around it. Living
creatures within 5 feet take 3d6 points of nonlethal cold damage. Fire brought
within 5 feet of the mold causes it to instantly double in size.

A 5-foot patch of endothermic mold is destroyed if it takes 5 or more points
of cold damage.
