This power makes a Medium-size or smaller person regard the manifester as his
or her trusted friend and ally. If the target is currently being threatened or
attacked by the manifester or allies, however, the subject receives a +5 bonus
on his or her [ saving throw ](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) .

The power does not enable the manifester to control the charmed person as if
he or she was an automaton, but he or she does perceive the manifester’s words
and actions in the most favorable way. The manifester can try to give the
subject orders, but the manifester must win an opposed [ Charisma](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) check to convince the subject to do
anything he or she would not ordinarily do. (The manifester can’t try again.)
A charmed person never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders. Any act by
the manifester or his or her apparent allies that threatens the charmed person
breaks the power. Note also that the manifester must speak the person’s
language to communicate his or her commands.
