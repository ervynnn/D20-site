##  Lesser Domination

[ Charisma ](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) [Compulsion, Mind- Affecting, Language-Dependent]

Level: [ Telepath ](/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/telepath) 3; Display:
Mental; Manifestation Time: [ Attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions) ; Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10
ft./level); Target: One Medium-size or smaller creature; Duration: 1
day/level; [ Saving Throw ](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) : Will
negates; [ Power Resistance](/modern.d20.srd/special.abilities/power.resistance) : Yes; Power Point Cost:
5

The manifester can control the actions of a Medium-size or smaller creature.
The manifester establishes a telepathic link with the target’s mind. If the
manifester and his or her subject share a common language, the manifester can
generally force the subject to perform as he or she desires, within the limits
of the subject’s abilities. The power fails if no common language is shared.
The manifester knows what the target is experiencing but does not receive
direct sensory input from him or her.

The target resists this control, and if forced to take an action that goes
against his or her nature he or she receives a new [ saving throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) with a bonus of +1 to +4, depending on
the type of action required. Obviously self-destructive orders are ignored,
regardless of the result of the [ saving throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) .

Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is
unlimited. The manifester need not see the target to control him or her.
