This power provides information about an object’s previous owner. The amount
of information revealed depends on how long the manifester studies a
particular object.

1st Round: Last owner’s gender.

2nd Round: Last owner’s age.

3rd Round: Last owner’s appearance.

4th Round: Last owner’s primary [ allegiance](/modern.d20.srd/basics/allegiances) (if any).

5th Round: How last owner gained and lost the object.

6th+ Round: Previous-to-last owner’s gender, and so on.

An object without any previous owners reveals no information. A manifester can
continue to run down the list of previous owners and learn details about them
as long as the power’s duration lasts. If the manifester reads the same object
again, he or she doesn’t pick up where he or she left off in the list of
previous owners.
