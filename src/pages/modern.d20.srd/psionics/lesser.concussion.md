The target is pummeled with telekinetic force for 1d6 points of
[damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage). The manifester may choose to have the
power deal only nonlethal [damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) instead of
lethal [damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage).

Concussion always affects a target within range that the manifester can see,
even if the subject is in melee or has partial

[concealment](/modern.d20.srd/combat/concealment). Inanimate objects canâ€™t be
damaged by this power.
