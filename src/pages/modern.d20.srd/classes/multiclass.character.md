##  Multiclass Characters

A character may add new classes as he or she progresses in levels, thereby
becoming a multiclass character. The class abilities from all of a character’s
classes combine to determine a multiclass character’s overall abilities.

###  Class and Level Features

As a general rule, the abilities of a multiclass character are the sum of the
abilities provided by each of the character’s classes.

###  Level

“Character level” is a character’s total number of levels. It is used to
determine when feats and ability score increases are gained

“Class level” is the character’s level in a particular class. For a hero whose
levels are all in the same class, character level and class level are the
same.

###  Hit Points

A hero gains [ hit points ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) from each class
as his or her class level increases, adding the new [ hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) to the previous total.

###  Base Attack Bonus

Add the base attack bonuses for each class to get the hero’s base attack
bonus. A resulting value of +6 or higher provides the hero with multiple
attacks.


<table> <tr> <th> Base Attack Bonus </th> <th> Additional Attacks at </th> </tr><tr> <td> +6 </td> <td> +1 </td> </tr> <tr class="shaded"> <td> +7 </td> <td> +2 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> +8 </td> <td> +3 </td> </tr> <tr class="shaded"> <td> +9 </td> <td> +4 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> +10 </td> <td> +5 </td> </tr> <tr class="shaded"> <td> +11 </td> <td> +6/+1 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> +12 </td> <td> +7/+2 </td> </tr> <tr class="shaded"> <td> +13 </td> <td> +8/+3 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> +14 </td> <td> +9/+4 </td> </tr> <tr class="shaded"> <td> +15 </td> <td> +10/+5 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> +16 </td> <td> +11/+6/+1 </td> </tr> <tr class="shaded"> <td> +17 </td> <td> +12/+7/+2 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> +18 </td> <td> +13/+8/+3 </td> </tr> <tr class="shaded"> <td> +19 </td> <td> +14/+9/+4 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> +20 </td> <td> +15/+10/+5 </td> </tr> </table>



To use multiple attacks in the same round, a character must use a full attack,
which is a [ full-round action ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions) .

###  [ Saving Throws ](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws)

Add the base save bonuses for each class together.

###  [ Defense ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/defense) Bonus

Add the Defense bonuses for each class together.

###  [ Reputation ](/modern.d20.srd/reputation) Bonus

Add [ Reputation ](/modern.d20.srd/reputation) bonuses together.

###  [ Skills ](/modern.d20.srd/skills)

A multiclass hero uses his or her character level to determine the maximum
ranks the hero can have in a skill. If a skill is a class skill for any of a
multiclass hero’s classes, then use character level to determine a skill’s
maximum rank. (The maximum rank for a class skill is 3 + character level.)
When a multiclass hero gains a level in a class, he or she spends that level’s
skill points as a member of that class. Only that class’s class skills may be
purchased as class skills. All other skills, including skills for another
class the hero has levels in, are considered cross-class skills when ranks in
those skills are purchased at this level.

###  Class Features

The character gets all class features (talents, bonus [ feats](/modern.d20.srd/feats) , or other special abilities) of all classes for the
levels he or she possesses.

###  [ Feats ](/modern.d20.srd/feats)

A multiclass character receives a new feat every three character levels,
regardless of individual class level. Taking one level in a new class does not
entitle a character to receive the two feats that a beginning 1st-level
character gets.

###  Ability Increases

A multiclass character increases one [ ability score](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) by +1 every four character levels,
regardless of individual class level.

###  Adding a Second Class

When a character with one class gains a level, he or she may choose to
increase the level of his or her current class or pick up a new class at 1st
level. This could be a [ basic class ](/modern.d20.srd/classes/basic) or, if
the character qualifies for it, an [ advanced class](/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced) .

The character gains the 1st-level base attack bonus, base save bonuses, class
skills, other class features of the new class, [ hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) of the appropriate die type, and the new
class’s number of skill points gained at each additional level (not that
number x4, as is the case for a 1st-level character).

Picking up a new class is not exactly the same as starting a character in that
class. When picking up a new class, a hero doesn’t receive maximum hit points
but should roll the new Hit Die.

###  Advancing a Level

Each time a multiclass character attains a new level, the hero either
increases one of his or her current class levels by one or picks up a new
class at 1st level.

When a multiclass character increases one of his or her class levels by one,
the character gets all the standard benefits that characters receive for
attaining the new level in that class: more [ hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) , possible bonuses on [ attack rolls](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll) , [ Defense](/modern.d20.srd/combat/defense) , and [ saving throws](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) (depending on the class and the new
level), a new class feature (as defined by the class), and new skill points.

[ Skill ](/modern.d20.srd/skills) points are spent according to the class that
the multiclass character just advanced in. [ Skills ](/modern.d20.srd/skills)
are purchased at the cost appropriate for that class.

In general, a character can have levels in as many different classes as there
are classes.
