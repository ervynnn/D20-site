## Basic Character Classes

### Basic Class Descriptions

### Ability

This entry tells which ability is typically associated with that class.

### Hit Die

The die type used by characters of the class to determine the number of hit
points gained per level.

A player rolls one die of the given type each time his or her character gains
a new level. The character’s
[Constitution](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) modifier is applied to
the roll. Add the result to the character’s hit point total. Even if the
result is 0 or lower, the character always gains at least 1 hit point. A 1st-
level character gets the maximum hit points rather than rolling (although the
[Constitution](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) modifier is still
applied).

### [Action Points](/modern.d20.srd/basics/action.points)

The number of [action points](/modern.d20.srd/basics/action.points) gained per
level.

### Class [Skills](/modern.d20.srd/skills)

This section of a class description provides a list of class skills and also
gives the number of skill points the character starts with at 1st level and
the number of skill points gained each level thereafter. A character’s
[Intelligence](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) modifier is applied to
determine the total skill points gained each level (but always at least 1
point per level, even for a character with an
[Intelligence](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) penalty).

A 1st-level character starts with 4 times the number of skill points he or she
receives upon attaining each level beyond 1st. The maximum ranks a character
can have in a class skill is the character’s level +3.

A character can also buy skills from other classes’ skill lists. Each skill
point buys a half rank in these cross-class skills, and a character can only
buy up to half the maximum ranks of a class skill.

### Starting [Feats](/modern.d20.srd/feats)

The feats gained at 1st level in the class.

in the class. It includes the following information.

Fort Save: The base save bonus for Fortitude [saving throws](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws). The character’s

[Dexterity](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) modifier also applies.

Will Save: The base save bonus for Will [saving throws](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws). The character’s

that follows.

[Reputation](/modern.d20.srd/reputation) bonus.

### Class Features

This entry details special characteristics of the class, including bonus feats
and unique talents, that are gained as a character attains higher levels in
the class.

### Talents

Every basic class offers a selection of talents to choose from. A character
gains a talent upon attaining each odd-numbered level in a class (including
1st level). Talents are considered to be extraordinary abilities. Some talents
have prerequisites that must be met before a character can select them.

### Bonus Feats

Every basic class offers a selection of bonus feats to choose from. A
character gains a bonus feat upon attaining each even-numbered level in a
class. These bonus feats are in addition to the feats that all characters
receive as they attain new levels. Some feats have prerequisites that must be
met before a character can select them.
