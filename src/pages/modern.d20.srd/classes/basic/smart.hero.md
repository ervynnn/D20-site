### Starting Feats

In addition to the two feats all characters get at 1st level, a Smart hero
begins play with the [Simple Weapons Proficiency](/modern.d20.srd/feats/simple.weapons.proficiency) feat.

### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the Smart hero.

### Talents

At 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level, the Smart hero selects a talent from the
following talent trees. Some trees have a set order that must be followed,
while others provide a list to choose from. As long as the hero qualifies, he
or she can select freely from any and all talent trees. No talent can be
selected more than once unless expressly indicated.

### Research Talent Tree

The Smart hero has a natural aptitude for study and fact-finding. These
talents can be selected in any order.

**Savant** : Select one of the skills listed in the following paragraph. The
hero must have ranks in the skill if it is Trained Only. The Smart hero gets
to add a bonus equal to his or her Smart level when making checks with that
skill. A Smart hero can take this talent multiple times; each time it applies
to a different skill.

[Computer Use](/modern.d20.srd/skills/computer.use),
[Craft](/modern.d20.srd/skills/craft) (any single skill), [Decipher Script](/modern.d20.srd/skills/decipher.script),
[Demolitions](/modern.d20.srd/skills/demolitions), [Disable Device](/modern.d20.srd/skills/disable.device),
[Forgery](/modern.d20.srd/skills/forgery),
[Investigate](/modern.d20.srd/skills/investigate),
[Knowledge](/modern.d20.srd/skills/knowledge) (any single skill),
[Navigate](/modern.d20.srd/skills/navigate),
[Repair](/modern.d20.srd/skills/repair),
[Research](/modern.d20.srd/skills/research),
[Search](/modern.d20.srd/skills/search).

**Linguist** : With this talent, the Smart hero becomes a master linguist.
Whenever the hero encounters a new language, either spoken or written, that he
or she does not know the Smart hero can make an
[Intelligence](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) check to determine if he
or she can understand it. The check is made with a bonus equal to the hero’s
Smart level. For a written language, the bonus applies to a [Decipher Script](/modern.d20.srd/skills/decipher.script) check instead.

The DC for the check depends on the situation: DC 15 if the language is in the
same group as a language the hero has as a [Read/Write Language](/modern.d20.srd/skills/read.write.language) or [Speak Language](/modern.d20.srd/skills/speak.language) skill; DC 20 if the language
is unrelated to any other languages the hero knows; and DC 25 if the language
is ancient or unique. With this special ability, a Smart hero can glean enough
meaning from a conversation or document to ascertain the basic message, but
this ability in no way simulates actually being able to converse or fluently
read and write in a given language.

A single check covers roughly one minute of a spoken language or one page of a
written language.

Prerequisite: At least 1 rank in either [Read/Write Language](/modern.d20.srd/skills/read.write.language) or [Speak Language](/modern.d20.srd/skills/speak.language) for each of three different
languages.

### Strategy Talent Tree

The Smart hero has the brainpower to see solutions in most situations. These
talents can be selected in any order, but before the hero can select a talent
from this tree he or she must have previously selected at least one talent
from the Research Talent Tree.

**Exploit Weakness** : After 1 round of combat, the Smart hero can designate
one opponent and try to find ways to gain an advantage by using brains over
brawn. The Smart hero uses a [move action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/move.actions) and makes an
[Intelligence](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) check (DC 15) with a
bonus equal to his or her Smart level. If the check succeeds, for the rest of
the combat the Smart hero uses his or her
[Intelligence](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) bonus instead of either
[Strength](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) or
[Dexterity](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) bonus on [attack rolls](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll) as the hero finds ways to outthink
his opponent and notices weaknesses in his opponent’s fighting style.

Prerequisite: One talent from the Research Talent Tree.

**Plan** : Prior to an encounter the Smart hero can develop a plan of action
to handle the situation. Using this talent requires preparation; a Smart hero
can’t use this talent when [surprised](/modern.d20.srd/combat/surprise) or
otherwise unprepared for a particular situation. Creating a plan requires 1
minute.

After creating the plan the Smart hero makes an
[Intelligence](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) check (DC 10) with a
bonus equal to his or her Smart level. The result of the check provides the
Smart hero and allies with a circumstance bonus. A Smart hero can’t [take 10](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#take10) or
[20](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#take20) when making this check.


<table> <tr> <th>Check Result</th><th>Bonus</th></tr> <tr><td>9 or lower</td><td>+0 (check failed)</td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td>10–14</td><td>+1</td></tr> <tr><td>15–24</td><td>+2</td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td>25 or higher</td><td>+3</td></tr> </table>


This bonus can be applied to all [skill checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) and attack rolls made
by the Smart hero and his or her allies, but the bonus only lasts for the
first 3 rounds after making the plan. After that time, reduce the bonus by 1
point (to a minimum of +0) for every additional round the situation continues,
as the vagaries of circumstance begin to unravel even the best-laid plans.

Prerequisite: One talent from the Research Talent Tree.

**Trick** : The Smart hero has the ability to temporarily confuse a target
through the use of ploy and deception. The target must have an
[Intelligence](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) score of 3 or higher to
be susceptible to a trick, must be within 30 feet of the hero, and must be
able to hear and understand the hero.

To play a trick on a target, the hero must use a [full-round action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions) and make an
[Intelligence](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) check (DC 15), adding
his or her Smart level as a bonus. If the
[Intelligence](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) check succeeds, the
target can try to think quickly and ignore the trick.

The target resists the trick by making a Will [saving throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) (DC 10 + Smart hero’s class level
+ Smart hero’s Int bonus). If the [saving throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) fails, the target becomes
[dazed](/modern.d20.srd/conditions) (unable to act, but can defend normally)
for 1 round.

A trick can only be played on a particular target once per encounter. After
the first trick in an encounter, whether the attempt succeeds or not, that
target becomes wary and immune to such ploys. This is a mind-affecting
ability.

Prerequisite: One talent from the Research Talent Tree.

### Bonus Feats

At 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th level, the Smart hero gains a bonus feat. This
feat must be selected from the following list, and the Smart hero must meet
any prerequisites.

[Cautious](/modern.d20.srd/feats/cautious), [Combat Expertise](/modern.d20.srd/feats/combat.expertise),
