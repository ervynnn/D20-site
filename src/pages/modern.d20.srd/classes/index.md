Character classes in the Modern d20 system are divided into two main categories: Basic Classes and Advanced Classes.

### Basic Classes

All characters begin with one of six basic hero classes. These classes represent broad character archetypes and provide the foundation for character development:

- **Charismatic Hero**: Masters of social interaction and leadership
- **Dedicated Hero**: Specialists in knowledge, healing, and support
- **Fast Hero**: Experts in speed, agility, and ranged combat
- **Smart Hero**: Intellectual characters focused on skills and problem-solving
- **Strong Hero**: Physical powerhouses specializing in melee combat
- **Tough Hero**: Durable characters with high hit points and resilience

### Advanced Classes

Once characters reach certain levels and meet specific prerequisites, they can multiclass into advanced classes. These specialized roles provide focused abilities and represent professional careers or specialized training.

### Multiclassing

Characters can combine levels from different classes to create unique builds. See the [Multiclass Characters](/modern.d20.srd/classes/multiclass.character) section for rules on mixing classes effectively.
