## Advanced Classes

An advanced class represents a focus and a calling for the experienced
adventurer. It provides a specialization and a range of power and ability to
give a character that something extra to set him or her apart.

Although each advanced class naturally builds from a certain [basic class](/modern.d20.srd/basics), every advanced class is available to all
characters who fulfill the prerequisites of the class, regardless of what
basic classes they have gained levels in. The associations between [basic classes](/modern.d20.srd/basics) and advanced classes are summarized on the
following table.


<table> <tr><th>Basic Class<sup>1</sup></th><th>Advanced Class</th></tr> <tr><td><a href="/modern.d20.srd/classes/basic/strong.hero">Strong</a></td> <td><a href="/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/soldier">Soldier</a>; <a href="/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/martial.artist">Martial Artist</a>; <a href="/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/battle.mind">Battle Mind</a>; <a href="/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/shadow.slayer">Shadow Slayer</a></td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td><a href="/modern.d20.srd/classes/basic/fast.hero">Fast</a></td> <td><a href="/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/gunslinger">Gunslinger</a>; <a href="/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/infiltrator">Infiltrator</a></td></tr> <tr><td><a href="/modern.d20.srd/classes/basic/tough.hero">Tough</a></td> <td><a href="/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/daredevil">Daredevil</a>; <a href="/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/bodyguard">Bodyguard</a></td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td><a href="/modern.d20.srd/classes/basic/smart.hero">Smart</a></td> <td><a href="/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/field.scientist">Field Scientist</a>; <a href="/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/techie">Techie</a>; <a href="/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/mage">Mage</a>; <a href="/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/occultist">Occultist</a></td></tr> <tr><td><a href="/modern.d20.srd/classes/basic/dedicated.hero">Dedicated</a></td> <td><a href="/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/field.medic">Field Medic</a>; <a href="/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/investigator">Investigator</a>, <a href="/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/acolyte">Acolyte</a></td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td><a href="/modern.d20.srd/classes/basic/charismatic.hero">Charismatic</a></td> <td><a href="/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/personality">Personality</a>; <a href="/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/negotiator">Negotiator</a>; <a href="/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/telepath">Telepath</a></td></tr> <tr><td colspan="2" style="font-size:.8em"><sup>1</sup> The given basic class provides the fastest path to both of the associated advanced classes, though not the only path.</td></tr> </table>


The Gamemaster may add advanced classes specifically suited to his or her
campaign. Conversely, the GM can decide that certain advanced classes arenâ€™t
available in the campaign. Check with your GM before selecting an advanced
class.

### Qualifying for an Advanced Class

Advanced classes are like basic classes, except that they have requirements
that must be met before a character can attain 1st level in the class. A
character who qualifies can choose an advanced class as an additional class as
he or she gains levels, using the multiclassing rules. Some combination of
base [attack bonus](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.bonus),
[feats](/modern.d20.srd/feats), and [skill](/modern.d20.srd/skills) ranks
determines whether a character is eligible to gain a level in an advanced
class.
