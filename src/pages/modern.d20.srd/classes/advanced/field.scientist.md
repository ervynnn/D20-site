### Class Features

The following features pertain to the Field Scientist advanced class.

### Smart Defense

A Field Scientist applies his or her
[Intelligence](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) bonus and his or her
[Dexterity](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) bonus to his or her
[Defense](/modern.d20.srd/combat/defense). Any situation that would deny the
Field Scientist his or her [Dexterity](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores)
bonus to [Defense](/modern.d20.srd/combat/defense) also denies the
[Intelligence](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) bonus.

### Scientific Improvisation

At 2nd level, a Field Scientist gains the ability to improvise solutions using
common objects and scientific know-how. This ability lets the Field Scientist
create objects in a dramatic situation quickly and cheaply, but that have a
limited duration.

By spending 1 [action point](/modern.d20.srd/basics/action.points) and
combining common objects with a [Craft](/modern.d20.srd/skills/craft)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) that corresponds to the
function desired, the Field Scientist can build a tool or device to deal with
any situation. The DC for the [Craft](/modern.d20.srd/skills/craft)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) is equal to 5 + the
purchase DC of the object that most closely matches the desired function. Only
objects that can normally be used more than once can be improvised.

Electronic devices, special tools, weapons, mechanical devices, and more can
be built with scientific improvisation. It takes a [full- round](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions) action to make an object
with scientific improvisation. The object, when put into use, lasts for a
number of rounds equal to the Field Scientist’s class level, or until the end
of the current encounter, before it breaks down. It can’t be repaired.

### Bonus [Feats](/modern.d20.srd/feats)

At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Field Scientist gets a bonus
[feat](/modern.d20.srd/feats). The bonus feat must be selected from the
following list, and the Field Scientist must meet all the prerequisites of the
feat to select it.

[Archaic Weapons Proficiency](/modern.d20.srd/feats/archaic.weapons.proficiency),
[Attentive](/modern.d20.srd/feats/attentive),
[Cautious](/modern.d20.srd/feats/cautious), [Combat Expertise](/modern.d20.srd/feats/combat.expertise),
[Educated](/modern.d20.srd/feats/educated),
[Gearhead](/modern.d20.srd/feats/gearhead), [Personal Firearms Proficiency](/modern.d20.srd/feats/personal.firearms.proficiency), [Point Blank Shot](/modern.d20.srd/feats/point.blank.shot),
[Renown](/modern.d20.srd/feats/renown),
[Studious](/modern.d20.srd/feats/studious).

### Skill Mastery

At 4th level, a Field Scientist selects a number of skills from his or her
class list equal to 3 + his or her
[Intelligence](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) modifier. When making a
[skill check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) using one of
these skills, the Field Scientist may [take 10](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) even if stress and
distractions would normally prevent him or her from doing so.

### Minor Breakthrough

Upon attaining 5th level, a Field Scientist receives credit for a minor
scientific breakthrough that earns him or her the recognition of her peers.
The Field Scientist chooses one of the following
[Knowledge](/modern.d20.srd/skills/knowledge) skills: behavioral sciences,
earth and life sciences, physical sciences, or technology. When dealing with
others with at least 1 rank in the same
[Knowledge](/modern.d20.srd/skills/knowledge) skill, the Field Scientist gains
a +2 bonus on [Reputation](/modern.d20.srd/reputation) checks.

This minor breakthrough also provides the Field Scientist with a +3 [Wealth bonus](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.bonus) increase.

### Smart Survival

A Field Scientist of 7th level or higher can spend 1 [action point](/modern.d20.srd/basics/action.points) to reduce the
[damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) dealt by a single
[attack](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll) or effect by 5 points.

### Smart Weapon

At 8th level, the Field Scientist selects one weapon that he or she is
proficient in and can use with one hand. With the selected weapon, the Field
Scientist can use his or her
[Intelligence](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) modifier instead of
[Strength](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) or
[Dexterity](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) modifier on [attack rolls](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll).

### Major Breakthrough

At 10th level, the Field Scientist gains a +2 bonus on
[Reputation](/modern.d20.srd/reputation) checks when dealing with individuals
who have at least 1 rank in any of the following
[Knowledge](/modern.d20.srd/skills/knowledge) skills: behavioral sciences,
earth and life sciences, physical sciences, or technology. This bonus stacks
with the bonus provided by the minor breakthrough ability.

This major breakthrough also provides the Field Scientist with a +3 [Wealth bonus](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.bonus) increase.
