### Class Features

The following features pertain to the Field Medic advanced class.

### Medical Specialist

The Field Medic receives a competence bonus on [Treat Injury](/modern.d20.srd/skills/treat.injury) checks. At 1st level, the bonus
is +1. It increases to +2 at 5th level, and to +3 at 8th level.

### Expert Healer

At 2nd level and higher, the Field Medic’s ability to restore [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) with a medical kit or surgery kit
and a successful use of the [Treat Injury](/modern.d20.srd/skills/treat.injury) skill improves. In addition to
the normal [hit point](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) recovery rate (1d4
for a medical kit, 1d6 per patient’s character level for surgery), the Field
Medic restores 1 [hit point](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) for every
level he or she has in this advanced class.

### Bonus Feats

At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Field Medic gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat
must be selected from the following list, and the Field Medic must meet all
the prerequisites of the feat to select it.

[Armor Proficiency (light)](/modern.d20.srd/feats/armor.proficiency.light),
[Armor Proficiency (medium)](/modern.d20.srd/feats/armor.proficiency.medium),
[Cautious](/modern.d20.srd/feats/cautious), [Defensive Martial Arts](/modern.d20.srd/feats/defensive.martial.arts),
[Dodge](/modern.d20.srd/feats/dodge),
[Educated](/modern.d20.srd/feats/educated), [Improved Initiative](/modern.d20.srd/feats/improved.initiative), [Medical Expert](/modern.d20.srd/feats/medical.expert), [Personal Firearms Proficiency](/modern.d20.srd/feats/personal.firearms.proficiency), [Surface Vehicle Operation](/modern.d20.srd/feats/surface.vehicle.operation), [Vehicle Expert](/modern.d20.srd/feats/vehicle.expert).

### Medical Mastery

When making a [Treat Injury](/modern.d20.srd/skills/treat.injury) [skill check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill), a Field Medic of 4th
level or higher may [take 10](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#take10)
even if stress and distractions would normally prevent him or her from doing
so.

### Minor Medical Miracle

At 7th level or higher, a Field Medic can save a character reduced to –10 [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) or lower. If the Field Medic is
able to administer aid within 3 rounds of the character’s death, he or she can
make a [Treat Injury](/modern.d20.srd/skills/treat.injury) check. The DC for
this check is 30, and the Field Medic can’t [take 10](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#take10) or [take 20](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#take20). If the check succeeds,
the dead character can make a [Fortitude save](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) (DC 15) to stabilize and be
restored to 0 [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points).

If the Field Medic fails the [skill check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) or the patient fails the
save, the dead character can’t be saved.

### Medical Miracle

At 10th level, a Field Medic can revive a character reduced to –10 [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) or lower. If the Field Medic is
able to administer aid within 3 minutes of the character’s death, he or she
can make a [Treat Injury](/modern.d20.srd/skills/treat.injury) check. The DC
for this check is 40, and the Field Medic can’t [take 10](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#take10) or [take 20](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#take20). If the check succeeds,
the dead character can make a [Fortitude save](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) (DC 20) to stabilize and be
restored to 1d6 [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points).

If the Field Medic fails the [skill check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) or the patient fails the
[Fortitude save](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws), the dead character
can’t be restored.
