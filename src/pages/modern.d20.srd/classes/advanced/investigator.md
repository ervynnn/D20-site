###  Class Features

The following features pertain to the Investigator advanced class.

###  Profile

By making a [ Gather Information ](/modern.d20.srd/skills/gather.information)
[ check ](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) (DC 15) when talking
to witnesses of a crime, the Investigator compiles a rough mental picture of
the suspect. This mental picture provides a physical description, including
distinguishing markings and visible mannerisms. Success makes the profile
accurate, at least concerning a particular suspect as seen by witnesses. (For
this [ Gather Information ](/modern.d20.srd/skills/gather.information) [ check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) , no money changes hands.)

The Investigator can expand the profile by making an [ Investigate](/modern.d20.srd/skills/investigate) [ check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) (DC 15) involving the crime
scene or other evidence linked to the suspect. If successful, the Investigator
combines eyewitness accounts with forensic evidence to develop a profile of
the suspect’s method of operation. This provides a +2 circumstance bonus on
any [ skill checks ](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) made to
uncover additional evidence or otherwise locate and capture the suspect.

###  Contact

An Investigator of 2nd level or higher cultivates associates and informants.
Each time the Investigator gains a contact, the GM should develop a supporting
character to represent the contact. The player can suggest the type of contact
his or her character wants to gain, but the contact must be an ordinary
character, not a heroic character.

A contact will not accompany an Investigator on missions or risk his or her
life. A contact can, however, provide information or render a service (make a
specific [ skill check ](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) on the
Investigator’s behalf).

At 2nd level, the Investigator gains a low-level contact, at 5th level a mid-
level contact, and at 8th level a high-level contact.

The Investigator can’t call on the same contact more than once in a week, and
when he or she does call on a contact, compensation may be required for the
assistance the contact renders. In general, a professional associate won’t be
compensated monetarily, but instead will consider that the Investigator owes
him or her a favor. Contacts with underworld or street connections usually
demand monetary compensation for the services they render, and experts in the
use of skills normally want to be paid for the services they provide.

For underworld or street contacts, this expense is represented by a [ Wealth check ](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.check) against a purchase DC of 10 for
the low-level contact, 15 for the mid-level contact, or 20 for the high-level
contact. For skilled experts, the purchase DC is 10 + the ranks the expert has
in the appropriate skill.

###  Bonus [ Feats ](/modern.d20.srd/feats)

At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Investigator gets a bonus [ feat](/modern.d20.srd/feats) . The bonus [ feat ](/modern.d20.srd/feats) must be
selected from the following list, and the Investigator must meet all the
prerequisites of the [ feat ](/modern.d20.srd/feats) to select it.

[ Advanced Firearms Proficiency](/modern.d20.srd/feats/advanced.firearms.proficiency) , [ Armor Proficiency (light) ](/modern.d20.srd/feats/armor.proficiency.light) , [ Armor Proficiency (medium) ](/modern.d20.srd/feats/armor.proficiency.medium) , [ Brawl](/modern.d20.srd/feats/brawl) , [ Defensive Martial Arts](/modern.d20.srd/feats/defensive.martial.arts) , [ Dodge](/modern.d20.srd/feats/dodge) , [ Double Tap](/modern.d20.srd/feats/double.tap) , [ Educated](/modern.d20.srd/feats/educated) , [ Knockout Punch](/modern.d20.srd/feats/knockout.punch) , [ Personal Firearms Proficiency](/modern.d20.srd/feats/personal.firearms.proficiency) , [ Point Blank Shot](/modern.d20.srd/feats/point.blank.shot) .

###  Nonlethal Force

At 4th level, an Investigator becomes adept at using nonlethal force to subdue
an opponent. From this point on, he or she can deal nonlethal [ damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) with a weapon that normally deals lethal [damage ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) (if he or she so chooses) without
taking the normal –4 penalty on the [ attack roll](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll) .

###  Discern Lie

At 7th level, an Investigator develops the ability to gauge whether another
character is telling the truth by reading facial expressions and interpreting
body language. The Investigator must be able to see and hear (but not
necessarily understand) the individual under scrutiny.

With a successful [ Sense Motive ](/modern.d20.srd/skills/sense.motive) [check ](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) opposed by the
subject’s [ Bluff ](/modern.d20.srd/skills/bluff) [ check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) result or against DC 10
(whichever is greater), the Investigator can tell whether the subject is
deliberately and knowingly speaking a lie. This ability doesn’t reveal the
truth, uncover unintentional inaccuracies, or necessarily reveal omissions in
information.

###  Sixth Sense

At 10th level, an Investigator becomes so attuned at solving mysteries that he
or she finds a way to put two and two together and rarely misses a clue.
Whenever the Investigator spends 1 [ action point](/modern.d20.srd/basics/action.points) to improve the result of a [ skill check ](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) made using certain
skills (see below), the Investigator gets to add an additional 1d6 to the
result.

The skills that sixth sense applies to are [ Gather Information](/modern.d20.srd/skills/gather.information) , [ Investigate](/modern.d20.srd/skills/investigate) , [ Listen](/modern.d20.srd/skills/listen) , [ Research](/modern.d20.srd/skills/research) , [ Search ](/modern.d20.srd/skills/search)
, and [ Spot ](/modern.d20.srd/skills/spot) .
