###  Sweep

An Infiltrator knows how to size up an area and get the lay of the land in a
single sweep of his or her eyes. This sweep provides a +4 circumstance bonus
on [ Spot ](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) checks and covers
an area out to 30 feet away from the Infiltrator. The Infiltrator can use this
bonus at the start of an encounter.

Anything not concealed can be spotted in a sweep with a successful [ check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) (DC 10). The DC for concealed
or less obvious threats is equal to their [ Hide](/modern.d20.srd/skills/hide) [ check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) result.

###  Improvised Implements

At 2nd level, an Infiltrator no longer takes a –4 penalty when wielding an
improvised weapon. Also, the Infiltrator is able to make do without proper
equipment in certain circumstances: the Infiltrator no longer takes a –4
penalty when using the [ Climb ](/modern.d20.srd/skills/climb) and [ Disable Device ](/modern.d20.srd/skills/disable.device) skills without the proper
tools.

###  Bonus [ Feats ](/modern.d20.srd/feats)

At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Infiltrator gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat
must be selected from the following list, and the Infiltrator must meet all
the prerequisites of the feat to select it.

[ Acrobatic ](/modern.d20.srd/feats/acrobatic) , [ Alertness](/modern.d20.srd/feats/alertness) , [ Armor Proficiency (light)](/modern.d20.srd/feats/armor.proficiency.light) , [ Athletic](/modern.d20.srd/feats/athletic) , [ Attentive](/modern.d20.srd/feats/attentive) , [ Brawl ](/modern.d20.srd/feats/brawl) ,
[ Cautious ](/modern.d20.srd/feats/cautious) , [ Defensive Martial Arts](/modern.d20.srd/feats/defensive.martial.arts) , [ Dodge](/modern.d20.srd/feats/dodge) , [ Elusive Target](/modern.d20.srd/feats/elusive.target) , [ Meticulous](/modern.d20.srd/feats/meticulous) , [ Mobility](/modern.d20.srd/feats/mobility) , [ Nimble ](/modern.d20.srd/feats/nimble) ,
[ Renown ](/modern.d20.srd/feats/renown) , [ Run ](/modern.d20.srd/feats/run)
, [ Stealthy ](/modern.d20.srd/feats/stealthy) .

###  Improved Evasion

If an Infiltrator of 4th level or higher is exposed to any effect that
normally allows a character to attempt a Reflex [ saving throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) for half [ damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) , the Infiltrator suffers no damage if he or
she makes a successful [ saving throw ](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws)
and only half [ damage](https://web.archive.org/web/20190908130310/file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/All%20Users/Documents/d20resources/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage)
on a failed [ save ](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) . Improved evasion
can only be used when wearing [ light armor](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/armor.light) or no armor.

For an Infiltrator who does not have evasion (see the [ Fast hero](/modern.d20.srd/classes/basic/fast.hero) class description), improved
evasion counts as evasion for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites on the
[ Fast hero’s ](/modern.d20.srd/classes/basic/fast.hero) defensive talent
tree.

###  Skill Mastery

At 5th level, an Infiltrator selects a number of skills from his or her class
list equal to 3 + his or her [ Intelligence](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) modifier. When making a [ check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) using one of these skills,
the Infiltrator may [ take 10](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) even if stress and
distractions would normally prevent him or her from doing so.

###  Improvised Weapon Damage

At 7th level, an Infiltrator’s [ attacks ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll)
with improvised weapons deal more [ damage ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) .
The Infiltrator treats an improvised weapon as one size category larger than
it is for the purpose of determining the [ damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) it deals.

###  Improved Sweep

At 8th level, an Infiltrator’s ability to get the lay of the land improves.
Now the Infiltrator not only spots potential perils with a successful check,
he or she can determine the relative strength of these dangers. A successful [check ](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) relates the danger’s
strength compared to the Infiltrator: stronger (higher level or Hit Dice), on
par (same level or HD), or weaker (lower level or HD).

###  Without a Trace

At 10th level, when an Infiltrator uses any of the following skills: [ Balance](/modern.d20.srd/skills/balance) , [ Climb ](/modern.d20.srd/skills/climb) ,
[ Disable Device ](/modern.d20.srd/skills/disable.device) , [ Escape Artist](/modern.d20.srd/skills/escape.artist) , [ Hide](/modern.d20.srd/skills/hide) , [ Move Silently](/modern.d20.srd/skills/move.silently) , and [ Sleight of Hand](/modern.d20.srd/skills/sleight.of.hand) , those using [ Investigate](/modern.d20.srd/skills/investigate) , [ Listen](/modern.d20.srd/skills/listen) , [ Search ](/modern.d20.srd/skills/search) ,
or [ Spot ](/modern.d20.srd/skills/spot) to detect the Infiltrator’s activity
take a –4 penalty.
