###  Class Features

The following features pertain to the Martial Artist advanced class.

###  Living Weapon

The Martial Artist attacks with either fist interchangeably, or even with
elbows, knees, and feet. This means that the Martial Artist may even make
unarmed strikes when his or her hands are full, and there is no such thing as
an off-hand [ attack ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll) for a Martial
Artist striking unarmed.

The Martial Artist also deals more [ damage ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage)
with unarmed strikes. At 1st level, the martial artist deals 1d6 points of [damage ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) with an unarmed strike. At 4th level,
[ damage ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) increases to 1d8. At 8th level, it
increases to 1d10.

This is an increase to [ Combat Martial Arts](/modern.d20.srd/feats/combat.martial.arts) damage; this has no effect on [Brawl ](/modern.d20.srd/feats/brawl) .

###  Flying Kick

Starting at 2nd level, a Martial Artist can use a charge to deliver a
devastating flying kick to an opponent. At the end of this charge, the martial
artist adds his or her class level as a bonus to the [ damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) he or she deals with an unarmed strike.

###  Bonus [ Feats ](/modern.d20.srd/feats)

At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Martial Artist gets a bonus [ feat](/modern.d20.srd/feats) . The bonus [ feat ](/modern.d20.srd/feats) must be
selected from the following list, and the Martial Artist must meet all the
prerequisites of the [ feat ](/modern.d20.srd/feats) to select it.

[ Acrobatic ](/modern.d20.srd/feats/acrobatic) , [ Advanced Combat Martial Arts ](/modern.d20.srd/feats/advanced.combat.martial.arts) , [ Archaic Weapons Proficiency ](/modern.d20.srd/feats/archaic.weapons.proficiency) , [ Combat Reflexes ](/modern.d20.srd/feats/combat.reflexes) , [ Combat Throw](/modern.d20.srd/feats/combat.throw) , [ Elusive Target](/modern.d20.srd/feats/elusive.target) , [ Exotic Melee Weapon Proficiency](/modern.d20.srd/feats/exotic.melee.weapons.proficiency) , [ Improved Combat Throw ](/modern.d20.srd/feats/improved.combat.throw) , [ Improved Combat Martial Arts ](/modern.d20.srd/feats/improved.combat.martial.arts) , [Unbalance Opponent ](/modern.d20.srd/feats/unbalance.opponent) .

###  Iron Fist

At 5th level, a Martial Artist gains the ability to spend 1 [ action point](/modern.d20.srd/basics/action.points) to increase the [ damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) he or she deals to a single opponent with a
single unarmed strike. The martial artist declares the use of the [ action point ](/modern.d20.srd/basics/action.points) after making a successful [unarmed strike ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll) . The result of the [action point ](/modern.d20.srd/basics/action.points) roll is added to the [damage roll ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) for that [ attack](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll) .

At 10th level, this ability improves. The Martial Artist now adds the result
of the [ action point ](/modern.d20.srd/basics/action.points) roll to all
successful attacks he or she makes in a round.

###  Flurry of Blows

At 7th level, a Martial Artist gains the ability to strike with a flurry of
blows at the expense of accuracy. The Martial Artist must be unarmored to use
this talent, and he or she must make unarmed strikes to gain the benefit. With
a flurry of blows, the Martial Artist may make one extra [ attack](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll) in a round at his or her highest [ base attack bonus ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.bonus) . This attack and each
other attack made in the round take a –2 penalty. This ability can only be
used when taking the [ full attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions) . The penalty applies to all
attacks for one full round, including [ attacks of opportunity](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attacks.of.opportunity) .
