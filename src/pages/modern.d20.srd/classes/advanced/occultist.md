### Class Features

The following features pertain to the Occultist advanced class.

### Arcane Skills

An Occultist has access to the following arcane skills. These skills are
considered class skills for the Occultist, and she can use her skill points to
buy ranks in them, just like other skills in the game.

**Concentration** [(Con)](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores): The normal
Concentration skill expands to include arcane applications, as defined below.

[Check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill): You must make a
Concentration [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) whenever
you may potentially be distracted while engaged in an activity, including
casting a spell or concentrating on an active spell, that requires your full
attention.

If the [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) succeeds, you
may continue with the action as normal. If the
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) fails, the action
automatically fails and is wasted. If you were in the process of casting a
spell, the spell is lost. If you were concentrating on an active spell, the
spell ends.

The table in the Concentration skill description summarizes the various types
of distractions. In situations where the distraction occurs while you are
casting a spell, you add the level of the spell to the DC.

Try Again?: You can try again, but doing so doesn’t cancel the effects of a
previous failure. If you lost a spell, the spell is lost.

Special: By making a check (DC 15 + spell level), you can use Concentration to
cast a spell defensively, thus avoiding attacks of opportunity. If the check
succeeds, you can attempt the casting without incurring any attacks of
opportunity.

### Use Magic Device [(Cha)](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores): Trained
only.


<table style="float: right"><tr><th>Task</th><th>DC</th></tr> <tr><td>Activate blindly</td><td> 25</td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td>Decipher a written spell</td><td> 25 + spell level</td></tr> <tr><td>Emulate class feature</td><td> 20</td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td>Emulate ability score</td><td> See text</td></tr> <tr><td>Emulate allegiance</td><td> 30</td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td>Use a scroll</td><td> 20 + caster level</td></tr> <tr><td>Use a wand</td><td> 20</td></tr> </table>


Use this skill to activate [magic devices](/modern.d20.srd/fx.items),
including [scrolls](/modern.d20.srd/fx.items/scrolls) and
[wands](/modern.d20.srd/fx.items/wands), that you could not otherwise
activate.

[Check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill): You can use this skill
to read a spell from a scroll or spellbook or activate a magic item. This
skill lets you use a magic item as if you had the spell ability or class
features of another class or a different
[allegiance](/modern.d20.srd/basics/allegiances).

When you’re attempting to activate a magic item using this skill, you do so as
an [attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions). However, the
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) you make to determine
whether you are successful at activating the item take no time by themselves
and are included in the activate magic item [attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions).

You make Use Magic Device
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) each time you activate
a device such as a [scroll](/modern.d20.srd/fx.items/scrolls) or a
[wand](/modern.d20.srd/fx.items/wands). If you are using the check to emulate
some quality in an ongoing manner, you need to make the
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) once per hour.

**Activate Blindly** : Some magic items are activated by special words,
thoughts, or actions. You can activate such items as if you were using the
activation word, thought, or action even if you’re not, and even if you don’t
know it. You do have to use something equivalent. You have to speak, wave the
item around, or otherwise attempt to get it to activate. You get a +2 bonus on
the [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) if you’ve activated
the item at least once in the past.

If you fail the [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) by 10
or more, you suffer a mishap. A mishap means that magical energy is released,
but it doesn’t do what you wanted it to. The GM determines the result of a
mishap. The default mishaps are that the item affects the wrong target or that
uncontrolled magical energy deals 2d6 points of
[damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) to you. This mishap is in addition to
the chance for a mishap normally associated with casting a spell from a scroll
when the spell’s caster level is higher than your level in this class.

**Decipher a Written Spell** : This works like the same use of the Spellcraft
skill (see the [Mage](/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/mage) Advanced Class),
except that the DC is 5 points higher. Deciphering a written spell takes 1
minute of concentration.

**Emulate Class Feature** : Sometimes you need a class feature to activate a
magic item. Your effective level in the emulated class equals your
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) result minus 20.

This skill use doesn’t allow you to use the class feature of another class. It
just lets you activate items as if you had the class feature.

If the class whose feature you are emulating has an allegiance requirement,
you must meet it. This may require a separate
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) to emulate allegiance
(see below).

**Emulate[Ability Score](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores)**: To cast a
spell from a scroll, you need a high [ability score](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) in the appropriate ability
([Intelligence](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) for [arcane spells](/modern.d20.srd/fx/arcane.spells),
[Wisdom](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) for [divine spells](/modern.d20.srd/fx/divine.spells)). Your effective ability score
(appropriate to the class you’re emulating when you try to cast a spell from a
scroll) equals your [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill)
result minus 15. If you already have a high enough score in the ability, you
don’t need to make this
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill).

**Emulate[Allegiance](/modern.d20.srd/basics/allegiances)**: Some magic items
have positive or negative effects based on your
[allegiance](/modern.d20.srd/basics/allegiances). You can use these items as
if you were of an [allegiance](/modern.d20.srd/basics/allegiances) of your
choice. You can only emulate one
[allegiance](/modern.d20.srd/basics/allegiances) at a time.

**Use a[Scroll](/modern.d20.srd/fx.items/scrolls)**: Normally, to cast a spell
from a [scroll](/modern.d20.srd/fx.items/scrolls), you must belong to a class
that has access to the arcane or divine spell inscribed therein. This use of
the skill allows you to use a [scroll](/modern.d20.srd/fx.items/scrolls) as if
you were of the appropriate spellcasting class. The DC equals 20 + the caster
level of the spell you are trying to cast from the
[scroll](/modern.d20.srd/fx.items/scrolls). To cast a spell from a scroll, you
must first decipher it.

In addition, casting a spell from a [scroll](/modern.d20.srd/fx.items/scrolls)
requires a minimum score of 10 + the spell’s level in the appropriate ability.
If you don’t have a sufficiently high score, you must emulate the ability
score with a separate [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill)
(see above).

**Use a Wand** : Normally, to use a wand you must belong to a class that has
access to the arcane or divine spell ensorcelled therein. This use of the
skill allows you to use a wand as if you were of the appropriate spellcasting
class.

Try Again?: Yes, but if you ever roll a natural 1 while attempting to activate
an item and you fail the check, then you can’t try to activate that item again
for 24 hours.

Special: You can’t [take 10](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#take10)
or [take 20](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#take20) with this skill.
Magic is too unpredictable to make the use of this skill reliable.

### Spell Resistance

An Occultist has spell resistance equal to 5 + her Occultist level. It never
interferes with her own spells, and she can voluntarily lower her spell
resistance at any time.

### Arcane Research ([Scrolls](/modern.d20.srd/fx.items/scrolls))


<table style="float:right;"> <tr><th>Level</th><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th><th>4</th><th>Research</th></tr> <tr><td>2nd</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>1 (DC 20)</td></tr> <tr><td>3rd</td><td>4</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>2 (DC 23)</td></tr> <tr><td>4th</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>3 (DC 25)</td></tr> <tr><td>5th</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>4 (DC 28)</td></tr> <tr><td>6th</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>5 (DC 30)</td></tr> <tr><td>7th</td><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>6 (DC 33)</td></tr> <tr><td>8th</td><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>7 (DC 35)</td></tr> <tr><td>9th</td><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>—</td><td>8 (DC 38)</td></tr> <tr><td>10th</td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>9 (DC 40)</td></tr> </table>


Starting at 2nd level, an Occultist can research spells and scribe
[scrolls](/modern.d20.srd/fx.items/scrolls). Indeed, the only way for an
Occultist to cast an [arcane spell](/modern.d20.srd/fx/arcane.spells) is by
using a [scroll](/modern.d20.srd/fx.items/scrolls). The method and process is
unique to the Occultist, and it differs from the Mage’s scribe
[scroll](/modern.d20.srd/fx.items/scrolls) ability. There is no purchase DC or
XP cost for the [scrolls](/modern.d20.srd/fx.items/scrolls) the Occultist
gains with each new level attained in this class.

When the Occultist attains 2nd level, and upon attaining each new level
thereafter, she uncovers spell [scrolls](/modern.d20.srd/fx.items/scrolls)
through arcane research and study. The GM randomly selects the spells
contained on the [scrolls](/modern.d20.srd/fx.items/scrolls), though the
Occultist can make a [Research](/modern.d20.srd/skills/research)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) to select a certain
number of her own spells. The table shows how many
[scrolls](/modern.d20.srd/fx.items/scrolls) of each spell level the Occultist
receives upon gaining a new level, and how many of these can be researched at
each level. A failed [Research](/modern.d20.srd/skills/research)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) indicates that the
Occultist instead discovers all random spells.

So, at 2nd level, the Occultist gains three 1st-level arcane spell
[scrolls](/modern.d20.srd/fx.items/scrolls). One of these spells can be
selected by the Occultist if she makes a successful
[Research](/modern.d20.srd/skills/research)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) (DC 20); the other two
spells are selected randomly. These are all the spell
[scrolls](/modern.d20.srd/fx.items/scrolls) the Occultist has until she
attains 3rd level. Once a spell is used, it disappears from the scroll that
contained it. The Occultist may find other scrolls in the course of her
adventures.

The Occultist uses the Use Magic Device arcane skill to cast a spell from a
[scroll](/modern.d20.srd/fx.items/scrolls) (see above).

### Bonus [Feats](/modern.d20.srd/feats)

At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Occultist gets a bonus
[feat](/modern.d20.srd/feats). The bonus [feat](/modern.d20.srd/feats) must be
selected from the following list, and the Occultist must meet all the
prerequisites of the [feat](/modern.d20.srd/feats) to select it.

[Alertness](/modern.d20.srd/feats/alertness), [Archaic Weapons Proficiency](/modern.d20.srd/feats/archaic.weapons.proficiency),
[Attentive](/modern.d20.srd/feats/attentive),
[Confident](/modern.d20.srd/feats/confident), [Defensive Martial Arts](/modern.d20.srd/feats/defensive.martial.arts),
[Focused](/modern.d20.srd/feats/focused), [Frightful Presence](/modern.d20.srd/feats/frightful.presence), [Iron Will](/modern.d20.srd/feats/iron.will), [Personal Firearms Proficiency](/modern.d20.srd/feats/personal.firearms.proficiency), [Point Blank Shot](/modern.d20.srd/feats/point.blank.shot).

### Shadow Contact

At 4th level, an Occultist gains a denizen of Shadow as a contact. The Shadow
creature can have HD equal to one-half the Occultist’s class level or less.
This Shadow creature may or may not be overtly hostile toward humans, but it
tolerates the Occultist. The Shadow creature will provide information or other
minor assistance as though its attitude toward the Occultist were friendly. It
might still omit important details, depending on its relationship with the
Occultist.

The Shadow creature doesn’t accompany the Occultist on adventures, and it may
not always be available when the Occultist wants it. In most cases, the Shadow
contact can be called upon once per week, and the creature requires some form
of compensation for each favor. Compensation can be a favor in return or
something appropriate to the creature in question.

If the Shadow creature dies, a new creature replaces it when the Occultist
attains her next level in this class.

### Bind Shadow Creature

At 5th level, an Occultist can select a type of Shadow creature (any creature
type other than [animal](/modern.d20.srd/creature.types/animal) or
[vermin](/modern.d20.srd/creature.types/vermin)) and bind one such creature
into service. A Shadow creature of the appropriate type and Hit Dice (GM’s
choice) appears at the Occultist’s side in 1d6+1 days. Thereafter, it serves
the Occultist, with an outward attitude of helpful (though it might inwardly
hate the Occultist who has trapped it into service). It obeys the Occultist,
providing protection, fighting at her side, and performing other services. It
always seeks to obey the letter of the Occultist’s command, and can sometimes
use this behavior to harm the Occultist or otherwise hinder as much as it
helps.

At 5th level, the Occultist can bind a Shadow creature with 2 HD or less.

At 8th level, the Occultist can bind a Shadow creature with 4 HD or less.

### Arcane Research (Items)

Starting at 7th level, an Occultist can perform research to find magic items.
The method and process is unique to the Occultist. There is no purchase DC or
XP cost for the magic items the Occultist gains with each new level attained
in this class.

When the Occultist attains 7th level, and upon attaining each new level
thereafter, she uncovers one magic item through arcane research and study. The
GM randomly selects the item, though the Occultist can make a Research
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) (DC 25) to specify the
type of item gained.

The item must be a [wondrous item](/modern.d20.srd/fx.items/wondrous.items), a
[wand](/modern.d20.srd/fx.items/wands), a [magic weapon](/modern.d20.srd/fx.items/weapons), or a set of [magic armor](/modern.d20.srd/fx.items/armor).

The Occultist uses the Use Magic Device arcane skill to use a magic item (see
above).

### Banish

At 10th level, an Occultist comes into her full power. By spending 1 [action point](/modern.d20.srd/basics/action.points) and an [attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions), the Occultist can utter a word
of power that forces a denizen of Shadow to return to the Shadow dimension.
The Shadow creature gets a [Will save](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws)
(DC 10 + Occultist’s level + Occultist’s
[Cha](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) modifier), adding a bonus equal
to its HD to the save. If the save succeeds, the Shadow creature doesn’t
disappear but is instead stunned for 1d4+1 rounds.
