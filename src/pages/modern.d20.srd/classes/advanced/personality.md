When others would normally make a
[Diplomacy](/modern.d20.srd/skills/diplomacy)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) or
[Bluff](/modern.d20.srd/skills/bluff)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) to smooth-talk or trick
their way into a private party or invitation-only event, the Personality adds
a bonus equal to his or her Personality level.

When a Personality buys a ticket to a show or for transportation, he or she
can make a [Diplomacy](/modern.d20.srd/skills/diplomacy)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) to get that ticket
upgraded. DCs are given below.

### Bonus Class Skill

At 2nd and again at 7th level, the Personality designates one cross-class
skill as a class skill. Once designated, the skill is considered a class skill
every time the character adds a new level of Personality.

### Bonus [Feats](/modern.d20.srd/feats)

At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Personality gets a bonus
[feat](/modern.d20.srd/feats). The bonus [feat](/modern.d20.srd/feats) must be
selected from the following list, and the Personality must meet all the
prerequisites of the [feat](/modern.d20.srd/feats) to select it.

[Alertness](/modern.d20.srd/feats/alertness), [Animal Affinity](/modern.d20.srd/feats/animal.affinity), [Combat Expertise](/modern.d20.srd/feats/combat.expertise),
[Confident](/modern.d20.srd/feats/confident),
[Creative](/modern.d20.srd/feats/creative),
[Deceptive](/modern.d20.srd/feats/deceptive), [Defensive Martial Arts](/modern.d20.srd/feats/defensive.martial.arts),
[Educated](/modern.d20.srd/feats/educated),
[Trustworthy](/modern.d20.srd/feats/trustworthy).

### Royalty

At 4th and 8th level, a Personality’s activities in the public eye generate
extra income. This income provides a [Wealth bonus](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.bonus) increase of +4.

### Winning Smile

At 5th level, a Personality develops such a force of personal magnetism that
he or she can convince a single target to regard him or her as a trusted
friend. (If the target is currently being threatened or attacked by the
Personality or his or her allies, this ability won’t work.)

The target makes a Will [saving throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws)
to avoid being persuaded by the Personality’s words and actions. The DC is 10
+ Personality’s class level + Personality’s
[Charisma](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) bonus.

This ability doesn’t enable the Personality to control the target, but the
target perceives the Personality’s words and actions in the most favorable
way. The Personality can try to give the target orders, but he or she must win
an opposed [Charisma](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) check to convince
the target to perform any actions the target wouldn’t normally undertake. The
target never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, and any act by the
Personality or his or her allies that threatens the target breaks the mood and
clears the target’s head. Otherwise, a target remains won over for 1 minute
per Personality level.

After the duration expires, the GM determines the reaction and attitude of the
target based on what the Personality compelled the target to do.

This is a Mind-Affecting ability.

### Compelling Performance

At 10th level, a Personality’s force of personal magnetism increases to the
point that he or she can arouse a single emotion of his or her choice—despair,
hope, or rage—in a target. To use this ability, the Personality must spend 1
[action point](/modern.d20.srd/basics/action.points). The emotion he or she
arouses affects one target (a GM character) within 15 feet of the Personality
(or within 15 feet of a television, radio, or telephone that broadcasts the
Personality’s performance). The performance requires a [full-round action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions), and its effects on the
target last for 1d4+1 rounds.

The target makes a Will [saving throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws).
The DC is 10 + Personality’s class level + Personality’s
[Charisma](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) bonus. If the target
succeeds at the [saving throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws), he or
she is immune to the compulsion of this performance. If the target fails, he
or she reacts to the emotion as described below.

Despair: The target takes a –2 morale penalty on [saving throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws)s, [attack rolls](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll), [ability checks](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores), [skill checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics), and weapon [damage rolls](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage).

Hope: The target gains a +2 morale bonus on [saving throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws)s, [attack rolls](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll), [ability checks](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores), [skill checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics), and weapon [damage rolls](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage).

Rage: The target gains a +2 morale bonus to
[Strength](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) and
[Constitution](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores), a +1 morale bonus on
[Will save](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws)s, and a –1 penalty to
[Defense](/modern.d20.srd/combat/defense). In a dramatic situation, the target
is compelled to fight, regardless of the danger.
