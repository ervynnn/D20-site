###  Class Features

All of the following are features of the Negotiator advanced class.

###  Conceal Motive

A Negotiator gets to add a bonus equal to his or her Negotiator level whenever
he or she opposes a [ Sense Motive ](/modern.d20.srd/skills/sense.motive) [check ](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) .

###  React First

Starting at 2nd level, a Negotiator gains the ability to react first when
trying to make a deal or mediate a settlement. The Negotiator must make
contact and speak to the participants prior to the start of combat. If he or
she does this, he or she gains a [ free readied action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/action.types) that allows the Negotiator to make
either a [ move ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/move.actions) or [ attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions) if either side in the negotiation
(other than the Negotiator) decides to start hostilities. The Negotiator gets
to act before any [ initiative ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/initiative) checks are
made, in effect giving him or her the benefit of surprise.

###  Bonus [ Feats ](/modern.d20.srd/feats)

At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Negotiator gets a bonus [ feat](/modern.d20.srd/feats) . The bonus [ feat ](/modern.d20.srd/feats) must be
selected from the following list, and the Negotiator must meet all the
prerequisites of the [ feat ](/modern.d20.srd/feats) to select it.

[ Advanced Firearms Proficiency](/modern.d20.srd/feats/advanced.firearms.proficiency) , [ Armor Proficiency (light) ](/modern.d20.srd/feats/armor.proficiency.light) , [ Armor Proficiency (medium) ](/modern.d20.srd/feats/armor.proficiency.medium) , [ Attentive](/modern.d20.srd/feats/attentive) , [ Confident](/modern.d20.srd/feats/confident) , [ Dead Aim](/modern.d20.srd/feats/dead.aim) , [ Deceptive](/modern.d20.srd/feats/deceptive) , [ Educated](/modern.d20.srd/feats/educated) , [ Far Shot](/modern.d20.srd/feats/far.shot) , [ Iron Will](/modern.d20.srd/feats/iron.will) , [ Personal Firearms Proficiency](/modern.d20.srd/feats/personal.firearms.proficiency) , [ Trustworthy](/modern.d20.srd/feats/trustworthy) .

###  Talk Down

A Negotiator of 4th level or higher can talk his or her way out of trouble.
Either prior to the start of hostilities or during combat, the Negotiator can
talk down a single opponent within 15 feet of his or her position or otherwise
able to hear the Negotiator’s voice. The target must be able to understand the
Negotiator. That opponent immediately stops fighting and reverts to an
indifferent attitude regarding the Negotiator and the situation in general.
Any hostile action by the Negotiator or by one of the Negotiator’s allies
directed at the opponent allows the opponent to act as he or she sees fit.

To initiate this talent, the Negotiator must spend a [ full-round action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions) talking to his or her opponent.
The opponent makes a Will [ saving throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) . The DC is equal to 10 + Negotiator’s
class level + Negotiator’s [ Charisma ](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores)
bonus. If the save fails, the opponent stops fighting. If the [ save](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) succeeds, the opponent continues as
normal.

At 7th level, a Negotiator can talk down a number of opponents equal to his or
her [ Charisma ](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) bonus within 15 feet
of his or her position or within 15 feet of a television, radio, or telephone
broadcasting the Negotiator’s message.

At 10th level, the range extends to 30 feet and covers all opponents who can
hear and understand the Negotiator’s voice.

This is a Mind-Affecting ability.

###  No Sweat

Starting at 5th level, whenever a Negotiator spends 1 [ action point](/modern.d20.srd/basics/action.points) to improve the result of a die roll,
he or she rolls an additional 1d6. The Negotiator can then select the highest
die roll to add to his or her d20 roll.

###  Sow Distrust

A Negotiator of 8th level or higher can turn one character against another.
The Negotiator must spend a [ full-round action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions) and know the name of the
character he or she is attempting to persuade as well as the name of the
character toward whom the target’s distrust will be directed. The target must
be able to hear and understand the Negotiator.

The target makes a [ Will save ](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) . The
DC is equal to 10 + Negotiator’s class level + Negotiator’s [ Charisma](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) bonus. If the target fails the [ save](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) , his or her attitude toward the other
designated character worsens by one step: helpful turns to friendly, friendly
to indifferent, indifferent to unfriendly, unfriendly to hostile (see the [Diplomacy ](/modern.d20.srd/skills/diplomacy) skill). The target makes a [Will save ](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) whenever the Negotiator uses
this talent against him or her. As long as the target continues to fail the [Will save ](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) , the Negotiator can
continue taking [ full-round actions](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions) to worsen the target’s attitude
toward a designated character. When the target’s attitude drops to hostile, he
or she attacks the designated character.

A successful [ Will save ](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) doesn’t
restore previous attitude shifts, but it does render the target immune for 24
hours to further attempts by the Negotiator to sow distrust.

The Negotiator can’t use this talent on his or her allies.

This is a Mind-Affecting ability.
