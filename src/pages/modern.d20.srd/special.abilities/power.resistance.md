## Power Resistance (Ex)

A creature with power resistance can avoid the effects of [psionic powers](/modern.d20.srd/psionics/index) that directly affect it. To determine
whether a [spell](/modern.d20.srd/fx/index) or spell-like ability works, the
[psionic power](/modern.d20.srd/psionics/index) manifester must make a level
check (1d20 + manifester’s level). If the result equals or exceeds the
creature’s power resistance, the power works normally, although the creature
is still allowed a [saving throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws).
