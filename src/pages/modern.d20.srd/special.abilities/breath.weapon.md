## Breath Weapon (Su)

A breath weapon [attack](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions) usually causes
damage and is often based on some type of
[energy](/modern.d20.srd/environment.hazards). It allows a [Reflex save](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) for half damage with a DC equal to
10 + ½ breathing creature’s HD + breathing creature’s
[Constitution](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) modifier (the exact DC
is given in the creature’s Species Traits). A creature is immune to its own
breath weapon and those of others of its kind unless noted otherwise.
