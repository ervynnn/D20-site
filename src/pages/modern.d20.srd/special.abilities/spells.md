Some creatures can cast [ arcane spells ](/modern.d20.srd/fx/arcane.spells) or
[ divine spells ](/modern.d20.srd/fx/divine.spells) (and can activate [ magic items ](/modern.d20.srd/fx.items/index) accordingly). These creatures are
subject to the same spellcasting rules as characters.

Spellcasting creatures are not members of an [ advanced class](/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/index) unless their entries say so, and
they do not gain any class features. A creature with access to [ divine spells](/modern.d20.srd/fx/divine.spells) must prepare them in the normal manner.
