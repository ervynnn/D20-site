title: Spell Resistance

A creature with spell resistance can avoid the effects of
[spells](/modern.d20.srd/fx) and spell-like abilities that directly
affect it. To determine whether a [spell](/modern.d20.srd/fx) or spell-
like ability works, the spellcaster must make a level check (1d20 + caster
level). If the result equals or exceeds the creatureâ€™s spell resistance, the
[spell](/modern.d20.srd/fx) works normally, although the creature is
still allowed a [saving throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws).
