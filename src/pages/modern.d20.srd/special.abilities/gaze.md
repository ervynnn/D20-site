A gaze attack takes effect when opponents look at the creature’s eyes. The
attack can have almost any sort of effect: petrification, death, charm, and so
on. The typical range is 30 feet, but check the creature’s entry for details.
The type of [saving throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) for a gaze
attack varies, but it is usually a
[Will](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) or [Fortitude save](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws). The DC is equal to 10 + 1/2
gazing creature’s HD + gazing creature’s [Charisma modifier](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) (the exact DC is given in the
creature’s Species Traits). A successful [saving throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) negates the effect.

Each opponent within range of the gaze attack must attempt a [saving throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) each round at the beginning of
his or her turn. Opponents can avoid the [saving throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) by averting their eyes or by
using a barrier to sight.

Averting One’s Eyes: The opponent avoids looking at the creature’s face and
instead looks at its body, watching its shadow, tracking it in a reflective
surface, or the like. Each round, the opponent has a 50% chance to not need to
make a [saving throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) against the gaze
attack. The creature with the gaze attack, however, gains one-half
[concealment](/modern.d20.srd/combat/concealment) against that opponent.

Barrier to Sight: An opponent that cannot see the creature at all cannot be
affected by its gaze attack. This can be accomplished by turning one’s back on
the creature, shutting one’s eyes, or wearing a blindfold or head covering
that prevents sight. The creature with the gaze attack gains total
[concealment](/modern.d20.srd/combat/concealment) against the opponent.

A creature with a gaze attack can actively gaze as an [attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions) by choosing a target within
range. That opponent must attempt a [saving throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) but can try to avoid the gaze as
described above. Thus, a target may need to
[save](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) against a creature’s gaze twice
during the same round: once before the target’s action and once during the
creature’s turn.

A creature is immune to its own gaze attack unless otherwise noted.
