Using nonvisual senses, such as sensitivity to vibrations, scent, acute
hearing, or echolocation, the creature maneuvers and fights as well as a
sighted creature. Invisibility and darkness are irrelevant. The ability’s
range is specified in the creature’s descriptive text. The creature usually
does not need to make [Spot](/modern.d20.srd/skills/spot) or
[Listen](/modern.d20.srd/skills/listen)
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) to notice creatures within range
of its blindsight ability.
