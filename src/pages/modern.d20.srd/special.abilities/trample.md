## Trample (Ex)

As an [attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions) during its turn
each round, the creature can run over an opponent at least one size category
smaller than itself, entering the opponent’s fighting space to do so. The
trample deals bludgeoning [damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage), and the
creature’s descriptive text lists the amount.

Trampled opponents can attempt [attacks of opportunity](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attacks.of.opportunity), but these incur a
–4 penalty. If they do not make [attacks of opportunity](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attacks.of.opportunity), trampled
opponents can attempt [Reflex saves](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) for
half damage. The save DC equals 10 + 1/2 trampling creature’s HD + trampling
creature’s [Strength modifier](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) (the
exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text).
