## Turn Resistance (Ex)

The creature (usually undead) resists attempts by [divine spellcasters](/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/acolyte) to turn it (see [Turn or Rebuke Undead](/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/acolyte)). When resolving a
[turn or rebuke attempt](/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/acolyte), add the
given bonus to the creatureâ€™s Hit Dice total.
