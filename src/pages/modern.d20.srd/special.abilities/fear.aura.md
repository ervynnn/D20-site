## Fear Aura (Su)

A fear aura either operates continuously or can be used at will. In either
case, it’s a [free action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/action.types). This ability
can freeze an opponent or cause opponents to become
[panicked](/modern.d20.srd/conditions). Other effects are possible.
Negating the fear effect requires a successful [Will save](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2
fearsome creature’s HD + fearsome creature’s [Charisma modifier](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) (the exact DC is given in the
creature’s descriptive text).
