## On-Hand Objects

To account for the mundane and innocuous objects that most people have among
their possessions—and not force every character to specifically purchase such
objects in order to employ them—use the following rules.

With the GM’s permission, a character can make a [Wealth check](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.check) to see if he or she has a mundane
object on hand, as long as the object has a purchase DC of 10 or lower. (The
GM determines the purchase DC for an object that’s not mentioned in this
chapter, using similarly priced objects as a guide.) The [Wealth check](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.check) works the same as for buying the
object, except that the character takes a –10 penalty on the check, and he or
she can’t [take 10](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) or [take 20](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics). Also, a character can’t
make a [Wealth check](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.check) to see if he or she
has a mundane object on hand during character generation or between
adventures—only during play. If the character succeeds, his or her [Wealth bonus](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.bonus) is unaffected, even if the
object’s purchase DC is higher than his or her [Wealth bonus](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.bonus).

Depending on the situation, the GM can rule that a certain mundane object is
not available; for an object to be obtainable, the character must be in a
place where the object logically would be.
