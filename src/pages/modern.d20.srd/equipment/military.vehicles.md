Several military vehicles are covered here. In addition, a number of the
civilian vehicles covered above, such as the AM General Hummer and the Bell
Model 212 helicopter, are commonly seen in military service.

### BMP-2

A Soviet-era armored personnel carrier, the BMP is used by the Russian army
and more than twenty ex-Soviet states or clients. It is crewed by a driver, a
gunner, and a commander. It has three top hatches, one above each crew
position, and a large door in back for infantry soldiers to load or disembark.
It takes a [full-round action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions) to
enter the vehicle through a top hatch and another full-round action to start
it moving. The BMP-2 is three squares wide and four squares long. It provides
full [cover](/modern.d20.srd/combat/cover) to its occupants.

This vehicle comes equipped with a 30mm cannon (see Table: Vehicle Weapons)
mounted in a full turret.

### M1A2 Abrams

This is the U.S. Army’s main battle tank, probably the most advanced and
powerful tank in the world. It is crewed by a driver, a gunner, a gun loader,
and a commander. It has three top hatches, one for the driver and two on the
turret. (The driver’s position cannot be reached from the other positions,
which are all in the turret.) It takes a [full- round](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions) action to enter a tank and
another [full-round action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions) to
start it moving. The Abrams is three squares wide and six squares long. It
provides full [cover](/modern.d20.srd/combat/cover) to its occupants.

This vehicle comes equipped with a tank cannon (see Table: Vehicle Weapons)
and an M2HB heavy machine gun (see Table: Ranged Weapons), both mounted in
full turrets.

### M2A2 Bradley

This is the U.S. Army’s principal armored personnel carrier. It is crewed by a
driver, a gunner, and a commander. It has three top hatches, one above each
crew position, and a large door in back for infantry soldiers to load or
disembark. It takes a [full-round action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions) to enter the vehicle
through a top hatch, and another [full-round action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions) to start it moving. In
addition to its own armament, the Bradley’s passenger compartment has ports
that allow passengers to fire their personal weapons from within the vehicle.
The Bradley is three squares wide and four squares long. It provides full
[cover](/modern.d20.srd/combat/cover) to its occupants.

This vehicle comes equipped with a 25mm cannon (see Table: Vehicle Weapons)
mounted in a full turret.

### M113A1 Gavin

Introduced in 1960s and for many years a mainstay of the U.S. Army, this
tracked armored personnel carrier is now in use by more than fifty countries.
It is crewed by a driver and a commander, and features a top hatch above each
position as well as a rear door. It takes a [full-round action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions) to enter the vehicle
through a top hatch and another [full-round action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions) to start it moving. The
Gavin is three squares wide and four squares long. It provides full
[cover](/modern.d20.srd/combat/cover) to its occupants.

### UH-60 Black Hawk

Introduced in the 1980s to replace the aging UH-1, the Black Hawk is the U.S.
Army’s primary utility helicopter. The UH-60 is three squares wide and twelve
squares long. It provides three-quarters [cover](/modern.d20.srd/combat/cover)
to crew and passengers (one-quarter [cover](/modern.d20.srd/combat/cover) to
passengers if the cargo doors are open).
