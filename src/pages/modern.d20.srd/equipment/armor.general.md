Body armor comes in a variety of shapes and sizes, providing varying degrees
of coverage and varying heaviness of materials.

Three feats cover proficiency in the use of armor: [Armor Proficiency (light)](/modern.d20.srd/feats/armor.proficiency.light), [Armor Proficiency (medium)](/modern.d20.srd/feats/armor.proficiency.medium), and [Armor Proficiency (heavy)](/modern.d20.srd/feats/armor.proficiency.heavy).

### Armor Table

Armor is described by a number of statistics.

Type: Armor comes in four types: archaic, impromptu, concealable, and
tactical.

Archaic armor is old-fashioned armor, such as medieval chainmail and plate
mail.

Impromptu armor includes items that provide protection even though they
weren’t designed for that purpose, such as leather biker’s jackets and
football pads.

Concealable armor is modern body armor designed to fit underneath regular
clothing. It can be worn for extended periods of time without fatiguing the
wearer.

Tactical armor is modern body armor that fits over clothing and can’t be
easily concealed. Its weight and bulk make it impractical to wear all the
time, and it’s generally only donned when a specific dangerous confrontation
is likely. Because it’s worn over clothing in tactical situations, tactical
armor often has pockets, clips, and velcro attachment points for carrying
weapons, grenades, ammunition, flashlights, first aid kits, and other items.

Equipment Bonus: The protective value of the armor. This bonus adds to the
wearer’s [Defense](/modern.d20.srd/combat/defense).

Nonproficient Bonus: The maximum amount of the armor’s equipment bonus that
can be applied to the wearer’s Defense if the wearer is using armor with which
he or she isn’t proficient (doesn’t have the appropriate feat).

Maximum Dex Bonus: This number is the maximum
[Dexterity](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) bonus to
[Defense](/modern.d20.srd/combat/defense) that this type of armor allows.
Heavier armor limits mobility, reducing a character’s ability to avoid
attacks.

Even if a character’s [Dexterity](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) bonus
drops to +0 because of armor, the character are not considered to have lost
his or her [Dexterity](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) bonus.

Armor Penalty: The heavier or bulkier the armor, the more it affects certain
skills. This penalty applies to checks involving the following skills:
[Balance](/modern.d20.srd/skills/balance),
[Climb](/modern.d20.srd/skills/climb), [Escape Artist](/modern.d20.srd/skills/escape.artist),
[Hide](/modern.d20.srd/skills/hide), [Jump](/modern.d20.srd/skills/jump),
[Move Silently](/modern.d20.srd/skills/move.silently), and
[Tumble](/modern.d20.srd/skills/tumble).

Speed (30 ft.): Medium and heavy armor slows a character down. The number in
this column is the character’s speed while in armor, assuming his or her base
speed is 30 feet (the normal speed for most human beings).

Weight: This column gives the armor’s weight.

Purchase DC: This is the purchase DC for a Wealth check to acquire the armor.
This number reflects the base price and doesn’t include any modifier for
purchasing the armor on the black market.

[Restriction](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/restricted.objects): The restriction
rating for the armor, if any, and the appropriate black market purchase DC
modifier. Remember to apply this modifier to the purchase DC when making a
[Wealth check](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.check) to acquire the armor on
the black market.
