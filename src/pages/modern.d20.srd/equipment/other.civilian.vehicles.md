A few types of vehicles don’t fit neatly into the categories covered above.
Many of these (such as the armored truck and the limousine) are usually custom
built, so the model name isn’t specified as it is with most other vehicles in
this section. The description and stats reflect a typical model.

### Armored Truck

Used to transport money between businesses and financial institutions, armored
trucks are designed to deter would-be thieves. The truck has three doors and
firing ports that allow the crew to use their firearms without leaving the
vehicle. The armored truck is two squares wide and four squares long. It
provides nine-tenths [cover](/modern.d20.srd/combat/cover) for its occupants.
It is equipped with puncture-resistant tires.

### Honda TRX400FW

This all-terrain vehicle is something like a four-wheeled motorcycle. It is
one square wide and two squares long. It provides no
[cover](/modern.d20.srd/combat/cover) for its riders.

### Limousine

A limousine is a big, comfortable car. The statistics given are for a
moderate-sized vehicle, rather than a stretch limo or a conventional car with
a professional driver. Limousines feature virtually every available luxury
feature, often including televisions and small refrigerators. A partition
divides the front seat from the rest of the vehicle. A limousine is two
squares wide and five squares long. It provides three-quarters
[cover](/modern.d20.srd/combat/cover) for its occupants.

### Moving Truck

This is a large cargo truck used to move furniture or deliver freight. Trucks
of this sort are often available as rentals. A moving truck is two squares
wide and five squares long. It provides three-quarters
[cover](/modern.d20.srd/combat/cover) for occupants in the cab and full
[cover](/modern.d20.srd/combat/cover) for any in the back.

### NABI Model 40LFW

This is a typical city bus. It has a door at the front and a second door about
halfway down the right-hand side. This vehicle is two squares wide and eight
squares long. It provides three-quarters [cover](/modern.d20.srd/combat/cover)
for crew and passengers.
