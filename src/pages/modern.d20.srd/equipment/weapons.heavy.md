The weapons covered in this section fall under the [Exotic Firearms Proficiency](/modern.d20.srd/feats/exotic.firearms.proficiency) feat. Someone
who wields a heavy weapon without the appropriate proficiency takes a –4
penalty on all [attack rolls](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll) with the
weapon.

### M2HB

This heavy-duty .50-caliber machine gun has been in service since World War
II, and remains a very common vehicle-mounted military weapon around the
world. The [Exotic Firearms Proficiency](/modern.d20.srd/feats/exotic.firearms.proficiency) (heavy machine
guns) feat applies to this weapon.

### M72A3 LAW

The LAW (light antitank weapon) is a disposable, one-shot rocket launcher. It
comes as a short, telescoped fiberglass and aluminum tube. Before using the
weapon, the firer must first arm and extend the tube, which is a move action.

When the LAW hits its target, it explodes like a grenade or other explosive,
dealing its 10d6 points of [damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) to all
creatures within a 10-foot radius ([Reflex save](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) DC 18 for half damage). Because
its explosive features a shaped charge designed to penetrate the armor of
military vehicles, the LAW ignores up to 10 points of hardness if it strikes a
vehicle, building, or object. However, this only applies to the target struck,
not to other objects within the burst radius.

The M72 has a minimum range of 30 feet. If fired against a target closer than
30 feet away, it does not arm and will not explode.

The [Exotic Firearms Proficiency](/modern.d20.srd/feats/exotic.firearms.proficiency) (rocket
launchers) feat applies to this weapon.

### M79

This simple weapon is a single-shot grenade launcher. It fires 40mm grenades
(see under [Grenades and Explosives](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/weapons.explosives)). These grenades
look like huge bullets an inch and a half across; they can’t be used as hand
grenades, and the M79 can’t shoot hand grenades.

Attacking with an M79 is identical to throwing an explosive: you make a ranged
[attack](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll) against a specific 5-foot square
(instead of targeting a person or creature). The differences between using the
M79 and throwing an explosive lie in the range of the weapon (which far
exceeds the distance a hand grenade can be thrown) and the fact that the M79
requires a weapon proficiency to operate without penalty.

The [Exotic Firearms Proficiency](/modern.d20.srd/feats/exotic.firearms.proficiency) (grenade
launchers) feat applies to this weapon.
