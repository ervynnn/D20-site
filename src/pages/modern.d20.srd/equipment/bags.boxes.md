With the wide variety of equipment available to modern adventurers, it’s often
critical to have something to store the equipment in or carry it around in.

### Aluminum Travel Case

A travel case is a reinforced metal box with foam inserts. Wing-style clamps
keep it from opening accidentally.

### Briefcase

A briefcase can carry up to 5 pounds worth of gear. A briefcase can be locked,
but its cheap lock is not very secure ([Disable Device](/modern.d20.srd/skills/disable.device) DC 20; break DC 10).

### Contractor’s Field Bag

A combination tool bag and notebook computer case, this has pockets for tools,
pens, notepads, and cell phones. It even has a clear plastic flap for maps or
plans. Made of durable fabric, it holds 10 pounds worth of equipment and comes
with a shoulder strap.

### Day Pack

This is a small backpack, the sort often used by students to carry their books
around, or by outdoor enthusiasts on short hikes. It holds 8 pounds of gear
and fits comfortably over one or both shoulders.

### Handbag

Handbags provide another way to carry 2 pounds of equipment. The purchase DC
shown is for a basic bag; high-fashion purses can increase the DC by as much
as 5.

### Range Pack

This lightweight black bag has a spacious inner compartment capable of holding
roughly 8 pounds of gear and can hold an additional 4 pounds in six zippered
external compartments. The larger version holds 12 pounds of equipment in the
internal compartment and another 6 pounds in the zippered external pouches. A
range pack easily holds several
[pistols](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/weapons.handguns) and a [submachine gun](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/weapons.longarms), and the larger version can
hold disassembled [rifles](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/weapons.longarms).

### Patrol Box

Originally developed for use by police officers, this portable file cabinet
has found favor with traveling salespeople. This hard-sided briefcase takes up
the passenger seat of an automobile and provides easy access to files, storage
for a [laptop computer](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/computers.consumer.electronics), and a
writing surface. It holds 5 pounds worth of equipment and has an average lock
([Disable Device](/modern.d20.srd/skills/disable.device) DC 25; break DC 15).
