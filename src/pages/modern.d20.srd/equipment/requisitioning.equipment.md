## Requisitioning Equipment

When a hero working for Department-7 needs more equipment than he or she has
on hand, the hero may try to requisition it. Department-7 evaluates whether
the character really needs the object, how soon the agency can supply it, and
whether the agency can reasonably expect to get it back when the hero is done
with it.

The result is determined by a level check (1d20 + character level) against a
DC equal to the equipment’s purchase DC. Add the character’s
[Charisma](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) bonus to the check. Table:
Requisition Modifiers lists modifiers that may affect the check.

The result of the check determines whether and how quickly Department-7 can
provide the hero with the requested equipment. With a success, the object is
issued to the hero. Generally, it takes 24 hours to obtain an object through
requisition, but if the object is especially common, or if the hero beats the
check DC by 5 or more, it is available in 1d4 hours.

Requisitioned objects are loaned, not given, to the hero. Obviously,
expendable objects like ammunition don’t have to be returned if used.
