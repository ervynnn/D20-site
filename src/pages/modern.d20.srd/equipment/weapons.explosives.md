Many explosives require detonators, which are described in Weapon Accessories.

### 40mm Fragmentation Grenade

This small explosive device must be fired from a 40mm grenade launcher, such
as the [M79](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/weapons.heavy). It sprays shrapnel in
all directions when it explodes. The 40mm fragmentation grenade has a minimum
range of 40 feet. If fired against a target closer than 40 feet away, it does
not arm and will not explode.

The purchase DC given is for a box of 6 grenades.

### C4/Semtex

So-called “plastic” explosives resemble slabs of wax. Hard and translucent
when cold, these explosives warm up when kneaded, and then can be coaxed to
take various shapes. The information on the table represents a 1-pound block.
Additional blocks can be wired together, increasing the damage and burst
radius; each additional block increases the
[damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) by +2d6 and the burst radius by 2
feet, and requires a [Demolitions](/modern.d20.srd/skills/demolitions)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) (DC 15) to link them.

Although the [damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) statistics on the table
represent a 1-pound block, C4 is sold in 4-block packages. The purchase DC
given represents a package of 4 blocks.

C4/Semtex requires a detonator to set off. It is considered to be a moderate
explosive for the purpose of using a [Craft (chemical)](/modern.d20.srd/skills/craft.chemical)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) to manufacture it.

### Det Cord

Det cord is an explosive in a ropelike form. Technically, det cord doesn’t
explode—but it burns so fast (4,000 yards per second) that it might as well be
exploding. Normally used to string multiple explosive charges together for
simultaneous detonation (allowing a single detonator to set them all off), det
cord can also be looped around a tree or post or other object to cut it neatly
in half.

The information on the table represents a 50-foot length. A length of det cord
can be spread out to pass through up to ten 5-foot squares. When this is the
case, it deals the indicated damage to all creatures in each 5-foot square
through which it passes.

It can also be doubled up; for each additional 5 feet of cord within a single
5-foot square, increase the [damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) by +1d6 to
a maximum increase of +4d6.

Det cord requires a detonator to set it off. It is considered to be a simple
explosive for the purpose of using a [Craft (chemical)](/modern.d20.srd/skills/craft.chemical)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) to manufacture it.

### Dynamite

Perhaps one of the most common and straightforward explosives, dynamite is
very stable under normal conditions. A stick of dynamite requires a fuse or
detonator to set it off. Additional sticks can be set off at the same time if
they are within the burst radius of the first stick, increasing the damage and
burst radius of the explosion. Each additional stick increases the
[damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) by +1d6 (maximum 10d6) and the burst
radius by 5 feet (maximum 20 feet).

It’s possible to wire together several sticks of dynamite for even greater
explosive effect. Doing so requires a
[Demolitions](/modern.d20.srd/skills/demolitions)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) (DC 10 + 1 per stick).
If the character succeeds on the check, the
[damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) or the burst radius of the explosion
increases by 50% (the character’s choice).

Dynamite is sold in boxes of 12 sticks. It is considered to be a simple
explosive for the purpose of using a [Craft (chemical)](/modern.d20.srd/skills/craft.chemical)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) to manufacture it.

To set off dynamite using a fuse, the fuse must first be lit, requiring a move
action (and a lighter or other source of flame). The amount of time until the
dynamite explodes depends on the length of the fuse—a fuse can be cut short
enough for the dynamite to detonate in the same round (allowing it to be used
much like a grenade), or long enough to take several minutes to detonate.
Cutting the fuse to the appropriate length requires a move action.

### Fragmentation Grenade

The most common military grenade, this is a small explosive device that sprays
shrapnel in all directions when it explodes.

The purchase DC given is for a box of 6 grenades.

### Smoke Grenade

Military and police forces use these weapons to create temporary
[concealment](/modern.d20.srd/combat/concealment). On the round when it is
thrown, a smoke grenade fills the four squares around it with smoke. On the
following round, it fills all squares within 10 feet, and on the third round
it fills all squares within 15 feet. The smoke obscures all sight, including
the [darkvision](/modern.d20.srd/special.abilities/darkvision) ability granted
by night vision goggles. Any creature within the area has total
[concealment](/modern.d20.srd/combat/concealment) (attacks suffer a 50% miss
chance, and the attacker can’t use sight to locate the target). It disperses
after 10 rounds, though a moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the smoke in 4
rounds and a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses it in 1 round. Smoke grenades are
available in several colors, including white, red, yellow, green, and purple.
As such, they can be used as signal devices.

The purchase DC given is for a box of 6 grenades.

### Tear Gas Grenade

Military and police forces use these weapons to disperse crowds and smoke out
hostage takers. On the round that it is thrown, a tear gas grenade fills a
5-foot radius with a cloud of irritant that causes eyes to fill with tears. On
the following round, it fills a 10-foot radius, and on the third round it
fills a 15-foot radius. It disperses after 10 rounds, though a moderate wind
(11+ mph) disperses the smoke in 4 rounds and a strong wind (21+ mph)
disperses it in 1 round.

A character caught in a cloud of tear gas must make a [Fortitude save](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) (DC 15) or be nauseated. This
effect lasts as long as the character is in the cloud and for 1d6 rounds after
he or she leaves the cloud. Those who succeed at their saves but remain in the
cloud must continue to save each round. A gas mask renders the target immune
to the effects. A wet cloth held over the eyes, nose, and mouth provides a +2
bonus on the [Fortitude save](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws).

The purchase DC given is for a box of 6 grenades.

### Thermite Grenade

Thermite does not technically explode. Instead, it creates intense heat meant
to burn or melt through an object upon which the grenade is set. Military
forces use thermite grenades to quickly destroy key pieces of equipment.

The purchase DC given is for a box of 6 grenades.

### White Phosphorus Grenade

White phosphorus grenades use an explosive charge to distribute burning
phosphorus across the burst radius. Any target that takes damage from a White
Phosphorus grenade is dealt an additional 1d6 points of fire
[damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) in the following round and risks
[catching on fire](/modern.d20.srd/environment.hazards/catching.on.fire).

In addition, a WP grenade creates a cloud of smoke. Treat a white phosphorus
grenade as a smoke grenade (see above), except that it only fills squares
within 5 feet of the explosion point.

The purchase DC given is for a box of 6 grenades.
