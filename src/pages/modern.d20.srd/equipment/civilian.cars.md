Most new civilian cars include such standard features as air conditioning, air
bags, antilock brakes, cruise control, keyless entry, and an AM/FM radio with
CD player. Luxury vehicles often also include extras such as heated side
mirrors, power seats, leather upholstery, and sunroofs. In general, these
luxury amenities can be added to a nonluxury car with an increase of 1 to the
vehicle’s purchase DC.

Unless otherwise noted, civilian cars provide three-quarters
[cover](/modern.d20.srd/combat/cover) for their occupants (although passengers
who lean out of windows or sunroofs, perhaps to fire weapons, may be reduced
to one-half or even one-quarter [cover](/modern.d20.srd/combat/cover)).
