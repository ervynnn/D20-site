Keeping an eye on suspects or tracking the moves of potential enemies is a
crucial part of the modern adventurer’s job.

### Black Box

This device, easily concealed in the palm of one hand, emits digital tones
that convince the phone system to make a long-distance connection free of
charge. They also let a user “bounce” a call through multiple switches, making
the call harder to trace (the DC of any [Computer Use](/modern.d20.srd/skills/computer.use)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) to trace the call is
increased by 5).

### Caller ID Defeater

When a phone line contains a caller ID defeater, phones attempting to connect
with that line show up as “anonymous” or “unavailable” on a caller ID unit.
Such a call can still be traced as normal, however.

### Cellular Interceptor

About the size of a small briefcase, a cellular interceptor can detect and
monitor a cell phone conversation within a 5-mile area by listening in on the
cellular service’s own transmitters. Intercepting the calls of a particular
cell phone requires a [Computer Use](/modern.d20.srd/skills/computer.use)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) (DC 35); if the user
knows the phone number of the phone in question, the DC drops by 10.
Obviously, the phone must be in use for someone to intercept the call. A
cellular interceptor cannot be used to intercept regular (ground line) phone
connections.

### Lineman’s Buttset

This device resembles an oversized telephone handset with a numeric keypad on
the back and wire leads hanging from the bottom. It functions as a portable,
reusable telephone line tap. With a [Repair](/modern.d20.srd/skills/repair)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) (DC 10), a user can
connect to a phone wire and hear any conversation that crosses it. A lineman’s
buttset is a common tool for telephone repair personnel.

### Metal Detector

This handheld device provides a +10 equipment bonus on all
[Search](/modern.d20.srd/skills/search)
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) involving metal
objects.

### Night Vision Goggles

Night vision goggles use passive light gathering to improve vision in near-
dark conditions. They grant the user the ability to see in darkness, also
called [darkvision](/modern.d20.srd/special.abilities/darkvision) (range 120
ft.)—but because of the restricted field of view and lack of depth perception
these goggles provide, they impose a –4 penalty on all
[Spot](/modern.d20.srd/skills/spot) and
[Search](/modern.d20.srd/skills/search)
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) made by someone
wearing them.

Night vision goggles must have at least a little light to operate. A cloudy
night provides sufficient ambient light, but a pitch-black cave or a sealed
room doesn’t. For situations of total darkness, the goggles come with an
infrared illuminator that, when switched on, operates like a standard
flashlight whose light is visible only to the wearer (or anyone else wearing
night vision goggles).

### Tap Detector

Plug this into a telephone line between the phone and the outlet, and it helps
detect if the line is tapped. To detect a tap, make a [Computer Use](/modern.d20.srd/skills/computer.use)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) (the DC varies
according to the type of telephone tap used; see below). With a success, the
tap detector indicates that a tap is present. It does not indicate the type or
location of the tap however. Also, it can’t be used to detect a lineman’s
buttset.

### Telephone Tap

These devices allow a character to listen to conversations over a particular
phone line.

Line Tap: This tap can be attached to a phone line at any point between a
phone and the nearest junction box (usually on the street nearby). Installing
it requires a [Repair](/modern.d20.srd/skills/repair)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) (DC 15). It broadcasts
all conversations on the line over a radio frequency that can be picked up by
any professional walkie-talkie. Detecting a line tap by using a tap detector
requires a [Computer Use](/modern.d20.srd/skills/computer.use)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) (DC 25).

Receiver Tap: This item can be easily slipped into a telephone handset as a
[Repair](/modern.d20.srd/skills/repair)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) (DC 5). It broadcasts
all conversations over a radio frequency that can be picked up by any
professional walkie-talkie. Detecting a receiver tap by using a tap detector
requires a [Computer Use](/modern.d20.srd/skills/computer.use)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) (DC 15).

### Telephone Line Tracer

Essentially a highly specialized computer, a line tracer hooked to a phone
line can trace phone calls made to that line, even if there’s a caller ID
defeater hooked up at the other end. All it takes is time.

Operating a line tracer is a full-round action requiring a [Computer Use](/modern.d20.srd/skills/computer.use)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) (DC 10). Success gains
one digit of the target phone number, starting with the first number of the
area code.
