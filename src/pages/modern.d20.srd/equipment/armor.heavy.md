For the best protection money can buy, go with heavy armor, but watch out for
the [armor penalty](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/armor.general).

### Plate Mail

This medieval-era armor consists of metal plates that cover the entire body.
It’s heavy and cumbersome compared to most modern armor, but it does provide a
great deal of protection.

### Special Response Vest

Built like the tactical vest, but incorporating groin and neck protection as
well as a ceramic plate over the chest, this armor provides additional
protection in battles against heavily armed opponents.

### Forced Entry Unit

The most powerful protection available is built into this suit, which consists
of a heavy torso jacket with ceramic plates over the chest and back, neck and
groin guards, arm protection, and a helmet. Heavy and cumbersome, this armor
is generally only donned by tactical officers heading into a dangerous
assault.
