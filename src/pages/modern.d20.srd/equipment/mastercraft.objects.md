[Weapons](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.weapons),
[armor](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/armor.general), and some other types of
equipment can be constructed as mastercraft objects. The exceptional quality
of these objects provides the user a bonus on [attack rolls](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll),
[damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage),
[Defense](/modern.d20.srd/combat/defense), or some other characteristic that
improves when the object is used.

A mastercraft object that provides a +1 bonus can usually be purchased on the
open market as a custom version of a common object. The increased cost of such
an object adds +3 to the purchase DC.

A rare few objects are of mastercraft quality even without customizationâ€”the
off-the-shelf version of the object is of such high quality that it is always
provides a bonus of +1. In these cases, the purchase DC is not increased (such
objects are already priced higher than similar objects of lower quality).

Mastercraft objects with a bonus of +2 or +3 are not common and are generally
not for sale. If a mastercraft +2 object could be found for purchase, its cost
would add +6 to the normal purchase DC. The cost of a mastercraft +3 object
would add +9 to the normal purchase DC.
