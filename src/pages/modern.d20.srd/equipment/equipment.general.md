### General Equipment

This section covers the wide variety of general gear available to adventurers
of all sorts.

Many of the objects in this section are battery-operated. Any device that uses
batteries comes with them. As a general rule, ignore battery life—assume that
heroes (and their antagonists) are smart enough to recharge or replace their
batteries between adventures, and that the batteries last as long as needed
during adventures. If battery life is important in the game, roll 1d20 every
time a battery-operated item is used. On a result of 1, the batteries are dead
and the object is useless. New batteries have a purchase DC of 2 and can be
changed as a move action.

### Equipment Tables

Equipment is described by a number of statistics.

Size: The size category of a piece of equipment helps to determine how easy
that object is to conceal, and it also indicates whether using the object
requires one hand or two. In general, a character needs only one hand to use
any object that is of his or her size category or smaller.

Weight: This column gives the item’s weight.

Purchase DC: This is the purchase DC for a [Wealth check](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.check) to acquire the item. This number
reflects the base price and doesn’t include any modifier for purchasing the
item on the black market.

Restriction: The restriction rating for the object, if any, and the
appropriate black market purchase DC modifier. Remember to apply this modifier
to the purchase DC when making a [Wealth check](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.check) to acquire the item on the black
market.
