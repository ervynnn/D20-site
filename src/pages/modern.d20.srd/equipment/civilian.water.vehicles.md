Piloting a water vehicle is covered by the
[Drive](/modern.d20.srd/skills/drive) skill.

### Bayliner 1802 Capri

This is a large runabout—a powerboat with an outboard engine and an open
cockpit with a tiny cabin (about the size of the interior of an economy car)
forward. It comes with a trailer; loading or unloading it requires a paved
boat ramp and 10 minutes of work. The Capri provides one-half
[cover](/modern.d20.srd/combat/cover) to occupants in the cockpit or stern,
full [cover](/modern.d20.srd/combat/cover) to occupants in the cabin, and no
[cover](/modern.d20.srd/combat/cover) to those forward of the cockpit. The
Capri is two squares wide and four squares long.

### Fairline Targa 30

This cabin cruiser is a motor yacht with two internal diesel engines. It comes
equipped with four berths and a fully equipped galley. It provides one-half
[cover](/modern.d20.srd/combat/cover) to occupants in the cockpit or stern,
full [cover](/modern.d20.srd/combat/cover) to occupants below deck, and no
[cover](/modern.d20.srd/combat/cover) to those forward of the cockpit. The
Targa is three squares wide and six squares long.

### Sea-Doo XP

This is a two-seat jet ski that propels itself with a powerful jet of water.
The Sea-Doo XP is one square wide and two squares long, and provides no
[cover](/modern.d20.srd/combat/cover) for its riders.
