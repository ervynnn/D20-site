## Concealed Weapons and Objects

It’s assumed that, when attempting to conceal a weapon or other object, a
character is wearing appropriate clothing.

Drawing a concealed weapon is more difficult than drawing a regularly
holstered weapon, and normally requires an attack action. Keeping the weapon
in an easier-to-draw position makes concealing it more difficult.

### [Sleight of Hand](/modern.d20.srd/skills/sleight.of.hand)
[Checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill)

To conceal a weapon or other object, make a [Sleight of Hand](/modern.d20.srd/skills/sleight.of.hand)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill). A character concealing
an object before he or she heads out into public can usually [take 10](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#take10) unless he or she is
rushed, trying to conceal it when others might see, or under other unusual
constraints. [Sleight of Hand](/modern.d20.srd/skills/sleight.of.hand) can be
used untrained in this instance, but the character must [take 10](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#take10).

### Size and Concealment

The object’s size affects the
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) result, as shown on
Table: Concealing Weapons and Objects. The type of holster used or clothing
worn, and any attempt to make a weapon easier to draw, can also affect the
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill).

### Spotting Concealed Objects

Noticing a concealed weapon or other object requires a
[Spot](/modern.d20.srd/skills/spot)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill). The DC varies: If the
target made a roll when concealing an object, the DC of the
[Spot](/modern.d20.srd/skills/spot)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) to notice the object is
the same as the target’s check result (an opposed check, in other words). If
the target took 10 on his or her [Sleight of Hand](/modern.d20.srd/skills/sleight.of.hand)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill), use this formula:

[Spot](/modern.d20.srd/skills/spot) DC = Target’s [Sleight of Hand](/modern.d20.srd/skills/sleight.of.hand) skill modifier (including
modifiers from Table: Concealing Weapons and Objects) + 10

An observer attempting to spot a concealed object receives a –1 penalty for
every 10 feet between him or herself and the target, and a –5 penalty if
distracted.

Patting someone down for a hidden weapon requires a similar
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill). However, the skill
employed is [Search](/modern.d20.srd/skills/search), and the searcher gets a
+4 circumstance bonus for the hands-on act of frisking the target. Some
devices may also offer bonuses under certain circumstances (a metal detector
offers a bonus to [Search](/modern.d20.srd/skills/search)
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) to find metal objects,
for example).

### Spotting Concealable Armor

Concealable armor can be worn under clothing if the wearer wants it to go
unnoticed. Don’t use the modifiers from Table: Concealing Weapons and Objects
when wearing concealable armor. Instead, anyone attempting to notice the armor
must make a [Spot](/modern.d20.srd/skills/spot)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) (DC 30).
