## Potions

A potion is an elixir concocted with a [spell](/modern.d20.srd/fx)-like or
[psionic](/modern.d20.srd/psionics) effect that affects only the drinker. A
potion is a single-use item that can only duplicate
[spells](/modern.d20.srd/fx) or [psionic powers](/modern.d20.srd/psionics) of
3rd level or lower. A potion vial has a Defense of 12, hardness 1, 1 hit
point, and a break DC of 12. A vial holds 1 ounce of liquid.

Drinking a potion takes an [attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions) and provokes [attacks of opportunity](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attacks.of.opportunity).

Purchase DC: A potion’s purchase DC is 17 + the potion’s caster level + spell
level unless noted otherwise.
