## Tattoos

Tattoos are single-use “items” containing a [spell-like](/modern.d20.srd/fx)
or [psionic](/modern.d20.srd/psionics) effect that affects only the bearer.
They can be drawn or imprinted just about anywhere on the body; however, the
bearer of a [magic](/modern.d20.srd/fx) or [psionic](/modern.d20.srd/psionics)
tattoo must touch it (and speak a command word) to activate its power, so
tattoos are normally placed in easy-to-reach places.

[Magic](/modern.d20.srd/fx) and [psionic](/modern.d20.srd/psionics) tattoos
are permanent until activated or dispelled.

Activating a tattoo is an [attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions), requires the utterance of a
command word, and does not provoke [attacks of opportunity](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attacks.of.opportunity).

Purchase DC: A tattoo’s purchase DC is 15 + the tattoo’s caster level or
manifester level + spell level or power level unless noted otherwise. The
purchase DC includes the cost of drawing or imprinting the tattoo on the body.
