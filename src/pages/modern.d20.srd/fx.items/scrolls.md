## Scrolls

A scroll is a spell [magically](/modern.d20.srd/fx) inscribed onto paper or
parchment so that it can be used later. Once the [spell](/modern.d20.srd/fx)
is cast, the scroll becomes blank or turns to dust. Scrolls are single-use
items. A scroll has a Defense of 9, hardness 0, 1 hit point, and a break DC of
8.

No preparation time is needed to cast a [spell](/modern.d20.srd/fx) written on
a scroll. The reader must perform the short, simple, finishing parts of the
[spell](/modern.d20.srd/fx). To use a scroll safely, a character must be high
enough level in the right class to cast the [spell](/modern.d20.srd/fx)
already.

Activating a scroll has four prerequisites. First, the reader must be able to
read the writing. This can be done with a successful Spellcraft check (DC 15 +
the spell’s level) or a [read magic](/modern.d20.srd/fx/read.magic) spell.
Second, the user must be able to cast [arcane spells](/modern.d20.srd/fx/arcane.spells) (for arcane spell scrolls) or
[divine spells](/modern.d20.srd/fx/divine.spells) (for divine spell scrolls).
Third, the user must have an
[Intelligence](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) score high enough to
cast the spell. Finally, the user must be able to see and read the text of the
scroll.

If the user isn’t high enough level to cast the [spell](/modern.d20.srd/fx)
normally, he or she must succeed at a caster level check (DC = the caster
level of the scroll +1). If this check fails, the spell fails and disappears
from the paper; the scroll is wasted.

Using a scroll is an [attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions)
that provokes [attacks of opportunity](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attacks.of.opportunity).

Purchase DC: A scroll’s purchase DC is 15 + the scroll’s caster level + spell
level unless noted otherwise.
