##  Holy Crossbow

Any bolt fired from this magic crossbow is blessed with holy power. It deals
+2d6 points of bonus holy [ damage ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) against
any creature with the evil [ allegiance ](/modern.d20.srd/basics/allegiances)
and bestows one negative level on any such creature that attempts to wield it.
The negative level remains for as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears
when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level never results in
actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration
spells) while the weapon is wielded.

(+1 or +2), 10th (+3); Purchase DC: 34 (+1), 39 (+2), 44 (+3); Weight: 7 lb.
