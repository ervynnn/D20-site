This potion forces the individual drinking it to say nothing but the truth for
10 minutes; a successful [ Will save ](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws)
(DC 12) negates the effect. Further, he or she is compelled to answer any
questions put to him or her in that time, but with each question he or she is
free to make a separate [ Will save ](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws)
(DC 12). If one of these secondary [ saves](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) is successful, he or she doesn’t break
free of the truth-compelling enchantment but also doesn’t have to answer that
particular question. No more than one question can be asked each round. This
effect is a mind-affecting enchantment.
