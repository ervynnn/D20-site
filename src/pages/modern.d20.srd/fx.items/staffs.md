A staff is a 4- to 7-foot-long, ornately wrought shaft of wood enhanced to
cast a number of different (though often related) spells or psionic powers.
Most staffs easily double as walking sticks or cudgels. A staff has a Defense
of 7, hardness 5, 10 hit points, and a break DC of 24.

A staff of divine spells can be used only by a divine spellcaster, and a staff
of arcane spells can be used only by an arcane spellcaster. Only creatures
with psionic abilities can use a staff of psionic powers.

Using a staff is an attack action and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
A staff has 50 charges when new.

Purchase DC: Unless noted otherwise, a staff’s purchase DC is 24 + the staff’s
caster level or manifester level + the total levels of the spells stored in
the staff.

For a used staff with 25 charges, reduce the purchase DC by 2.
