##  Saving Throws Against FX Items

Magic and psionic items either duplicate [ spells ](/modern.d20.srd/fx) or [psionic powers ](/modern.d20.srd/psionics) , or they have [ spell-like effects](/modern.d20.srd/fx) . The [ saving throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) against an effect from a magic item
has a DC equal to 10 + (1.5 x the level of the spell, power, or effect).

Most item descriptions give saving throw DCs for various effects, particularly
when an effect has no exact spell equivalent.
