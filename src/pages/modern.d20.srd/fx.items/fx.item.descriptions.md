##  FX Item Descriptions

Each entry includes a description of the item and its game effects. Following
the description is a line indicating the caster level or manifester level of
the effect, the item’s type, a typical purchase DC, and the item’s weight (in
pounds).

The GM may increase the purchase DC of an item to account for its rarity in
the campaign or lower the purchase DC of items that are readily available and
easy to mass-produce.
