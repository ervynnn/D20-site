A wand is a short stick imbued with the power to cast a specific
[spell](/modern.d20.srd/fx) 50 times. The spell must be 4th level or lower,
and the wand cannot be recharged. A typical wand has a Defense of 7, hardness
5, 5 hit points, and a break DC of 16.

A [divine spell](/modern.d20.srd/fx/divine.spells) wand can be used only by
divine spellcasters, while an [arcane spell](/modern.d20.srd/fx/arcane.spells)
wand can be used only by arcane spellcasters.

Using a wand is an [attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions) and
does not provoke [attacks of opportunity](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attacks.of.opportunity). A wand has 50
charges when new.

Purchase DC: Unless noted otherwise, a wand’s purchase DC is 24 + the wand’s
caster level + the level of the spell stored in the wand. The purchase DC is
for a fully charged wand. For a used wand with 25 charges, reduce the purchase
DC by 2.
