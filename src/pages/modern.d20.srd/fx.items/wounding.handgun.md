Any bullet fired from this magic [ Glock 17](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/weapons.handguns) deals such a terrible wound
that, in addition to taking normal [ damage ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) ,
the victim bleeds for 1 point of [ damage ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage)
each round thereafter. Multiple wounds from the handgun result in cumulative
bleeding loss. The bleeding can only be stopped with a successful [ Treat Injury ](/modern.d20.srd/skills/treat.injury) [ check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) (DC 15) or the application of
a healing spell.
