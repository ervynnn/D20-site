As with [armor](/modern.d20.srd/fx.items/armor), magic and psionic weapons
have enhancement bonuses. The enhancement bonus applies both to [attack rolls](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll) and [damage rolls](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) when the weapon is used in combat. All
magic weapons and psionic weapons are considered
[mastercraft](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/mastercraft.objects) items, but a
weaponâ€™s [mastercraft](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/mastercraft.objects) bonus
does not stack with its enhancement bonus.

In addition to an enhancement bonus, weapons may have special qualities. A
weapon with a special quality must have a +1 or better enhancement bonus.

Fully 30% of magic or psionic weapons shed light in a 20-foot radius. These
glowing weapons cannot be
[concealed](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/concealed.weapons.objects) when drawn,
nor can their light be shut off.

If a weapon has a special quality that the user needs to activate, then the
user must speak a command word (an [attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions)).

Purchase DC: To calculate the purchase DC for a weapon with an enchantment
bonus but no special qualities, use the following table.


<table> <tr> <th>Enhancement Bonus</th> <th>Purchase DC Modifier</th> </tr> <tr><td> +1</td><td> +10 </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td>+2</td><td> +15 </td></tr> <tr><td>+3</td><td> +20 </td></tr> </table>



Weapons with special qualities have an additional purchase DC modifier, as
noted under each item entry.

Examples of weapons with special qualities include the following.

[Charged Nunchaku](/modern.d20.srd/fx.items/charged.nunchaku)

[Flaming Machete](/modern.d20.srd/fx.items/flaming.machete)
