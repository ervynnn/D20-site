effective at the same time. The limits are:

  * 1 pair of eyeglasses, contact lenses, sunglasses, or goggles 
  * 1 amulet, brooch, medallion, necklace, necktie, or scarab 
  * 1 suit of armor (archaic or modern) 
  * 1 robe, jacket, windbreaker, or coat 
  * 1 cloak, cape, poncho, sweater, or mantle 
  * 1 vest or shirt 
  * 1 pair of bracers or bracelets, or 1 watch 
  * 1 pair of gloves or gauntlets 
  * 1 pair of earrings 
  * 2 rings 
  * 1 belt 
  * 1 pair of boots, shoes, or sandals

Of course, a character may carry or possess as many items of the same type as
he or she wishes.
