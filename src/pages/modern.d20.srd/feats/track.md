## Track

Benefit: To find tracks or follow them for one mile requires a
[Survival](/modern.d20.srd/skills/survival)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics). The character must
make another [Survival](/modern.d20.srd/skills/survival)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) every time the tracks
become difficult to follow.

The character moves at half his or her normal speed (or at the character’s
normal speed with a –5 penalty on the
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics), or at up to twice the
character’s speed with a –20 penalty on the check). The DC depends on the
surface and the prevailing conditions.

Very Soft: Any surface (fresh snow, thick dust, wet mud) that holds deep,
clear impressions of footprints.

Soft: Any surface soft enough to yield to pressure, but firmer than wet mud or
fresh snow, in which the quarry leaves frequent but shallow footprints.

Firm: Most normal outdoor or exceptionally soft or dirty indoor surfaces. The
quarry might leave some traces of its passage, but only occasional or partial
footprints can be found.

Hard: Any surface that doesn’t hold footprints at all, such as bare rock,
concrete, metal deckings, or indoor floors. The quarry leaves only traces,
such as scuff marks.

If the character fails a [Survival](/modern.d20.srd/skills/survival)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics), he or she can retry
after 1 hour (out­doors) or 10 minutes (indoors) of searching.

Normal: A character without this feat can use the
[Survival](/modern.d20.srd/skills/survival) skill to find tracks, but can only
follow tracks if the DC is 10 or less. A character can use the
[Search](/modern.d20.srd/skills/search) skill to find individual footprints,
but cannot follow tracks using [Search](/modern.d20.srd/skills/search).
