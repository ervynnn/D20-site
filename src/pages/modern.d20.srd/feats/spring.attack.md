title: Spring Attack
layout: '~/layouts/MarkdownLayout.astro'

Prerequisites: [Dexterity](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) 13,
[Dodge](/modern.d20.srd/feats/dodge),
[Mobility](/modern.d20.srd/feats/mobility), base attack bonus +4.

Benefit: When using an [attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions)
with a melee weapon, the character can move both before and after the attack,
provided that the total distance moved is not greater than the charater’s
speed.

Moving in this way does not provoke an [attack of opportunity](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attacks.of.opportunity) from the defender
the character is attacking (though it can provoke [attacks of opportunity](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attacks.of.opportunity) from others, as
normal).

A character can’t use this feat if he or she is carrying a [heavy load](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/carrying.capacity) or wearing [heavy armor](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/armor.heavy).
