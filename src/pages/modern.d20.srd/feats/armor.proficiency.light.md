Benefit: When a character wears a type of armor with which he or she is
proficient, the character gets to add the armor’s equipment bonus to his or
her [Defense](/modern.d20.srd/combat/defense). Also, the [armor check penalty](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/armor.general) applies only to
[Balance](/modern.d20.srd/skills/balance),
[Climb](/modern.d20.srd/skills/climb), [Escape Artist](/modern.d20.srd/skills/escape.artist),
[Hide](/modern.d20.srd/skills/hide), [Jump](/modern.d20.srd/skills/jump),
[Move Silently](/modern.d20.srd/skills/move.silently), and
[Tumble](/modern.d20.srd/skills/tumble)
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

Normal: A character who wears armor with which he or she is not proficient
adds only the armor’s nonproficient equipment bonus to his or her
[Defense](/modern.d20.srd/combat/defense). Also, he or she suffers its [armor check penalty](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/armor.general) on [attack rolls](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll) and on all [skill checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) that involve moving.
