Choose one light melee weapon, a rapier (if the character can use it with one
hand), or a chain. A character can choose unarmed strike or [ grapple](/modern.d20.srd/combat/grapple) as a weapon for the purposes of this feat.

Prerequisites: Proficient with weapon, base attack bonus +1.

Benefit: With the selected melee weapon, the character may use his or her [Dexterity ](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) modifier instead of his or
her [ Strength ](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) modifier on [ attack rolls ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll) .

Special: A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time the
character takes the feat, the character selects a different weapon.
