Benefit: During the characterâ€™s action, the character designates an opponent
and receives a +1 dodge bonus to [Defense](/modern.d20.srd/combat/defense)
against any subsequent [attacks](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll) from that
opponent. The character can select a new opponent on any action.

Special: A condition that makes the character lose his or her
[Dexterity](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) bonus to
[Defense](/modern.d20.srd/combat/defense) also makes the character lose dodge
bonuses. Also, dodge bonuses stack with each other, unlike most other types of
bonuses.
