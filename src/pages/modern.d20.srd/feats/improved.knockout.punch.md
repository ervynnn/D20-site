## Improved Knockout Punch

Prerequisites: [Brawl](/modern.d20.srd/feats/brawl), [Knockout Punch](/modern.d20.srd/feats/knockout.punch), base attack bonus +6.

Benefit: When making the characterâ€™s first unarmed
[attack](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll) against a flat-footed opponent,
treat a successful [attack](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll) as a [critical hit](/modern.d20.srd/combat/critical.hits). This [critical hit](/modern.d20.srd/combat/critical.hits) deals triple
[damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage). The
[damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) is nonlethal
[damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage).

Special: Even if the character has the ability to treat unarmed
[damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) as lethal
[damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage), the
[damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) from a knockout punch is always
nonlethal.
