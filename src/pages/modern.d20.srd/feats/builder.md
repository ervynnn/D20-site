Benefit: Pick two of the following skills: [Craft (chemical)](/modern.d20.srd/skills/craft.chemical), [Craft (electronic)](/modern.d20.srd/skills/craft.electronic), [Craft (mechanical)](/modern.d20.srd/skills/craft.mechanical), and [Craft (structural)](/modern.d20.srd/skills/craft.structural). The character gets a
+2 bonus on all [checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) with
those skills.

Special: The character can select this feat twice. The second time, the
character applies it to the two skills he or she didnâ€™t pick originally.
Remember that [Craft (chemical)](/modern.d20.srd/skills/craft.chemical),
[Craft (electronic)](/modern.d20.srd/skills/craft.electronic), and [Craft (mechanical)](/modern.d20.srd/skills/craft.mechanical) cannot be used
untrained.
