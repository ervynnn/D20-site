title: Dead Aim

Prerequisites: [Wisdom](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) 13, [Far Shot](/modern.d20.srd/feats/far.shot).

Benefit: Before making a ranged
[attack](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions), the character may take a
[full-round action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions) to line up your
shot. This grants the character a +2 circumstance bonus on his or her next
[attack roll](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll). Once the character begins
aiming, he or she can’t move, even to take a 5-foot step, until after the
character makes his or her next [attack](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll),
or the benefit of the feat is lost. Likewise, if the character’s concentration
is disrupted or the character is attacked before his or her next action, the
character loses the benefit of aiming.
