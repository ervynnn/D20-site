title: Unbalance Opponent
layout: '~/layouts/MarkdownLayout.astro'
---
Prerequisites: [Defensive Martial Arts](/modern.d20.srd/feats/defensive.martial.arts), base attack bonus +6.

Benefit: During the character’s action, the character designates an opponent
no more than one size category larger or smaller than the character. That
opponent doesn’t get to add his or her
[Strength](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) modifier to [attack rolls](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll) when targeting the character. (If
the opponent has a [Strength](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) penalty,
he or she still takes that penalty.)

The opponent’s [Strength](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) modifier
applies to [damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage), as usual.

The character can select a new opponent on any action.
