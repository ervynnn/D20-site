Prerequisites: [Strength](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) 13, [Power Attack](/modern.d20.srd/feats/power.attack).

Benefit: If the character deals an opponent enough
[damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) to make the opponent drop (either by
knocking the opponent out due to [massive damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/death.dying.healing) or by reducing the
opponent’s [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) to less than 0),
the character gets an immediate extra melee
[attack](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll) against another opponent adjacent
to the character. The character can’t take a 5-foot step before making this
extra attack. The extra attack is with the same weapon and at the same bonus
as the attack that dropped the previous opponent. The character can use this
ability once per round.
