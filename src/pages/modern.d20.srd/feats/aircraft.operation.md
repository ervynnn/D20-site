## Aircraft Operation

Select a class of aircraft (heavy aircraft, helicopters, jet fighters, or
spacecraft). The character is proficient at operating that class of aircraft.

The heavy aircraft class includes jumbo passenger airplanes, large cargo
planes, heavy bombers, and any other aircraft with three or more engines.
Helicopters include transport and combat helicopters of all types. Jet
fighters include military fighter and ground attack jets. Spacecraft are
vehicles such as the space shuttle and the lunar lander.

Prerequisite: [Pilot](/modern.d20.srd/skills/pilot) 4 ranks.

Benefit: The character takes no penalty on
[Pilot](/modern.d20.srd/skills/pilot)
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) or [attack rolls](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll) made when operating an aircraft of
the selected class.

Normal: Characters without this feat take a â€“4 penalty on
[Pilot](/modern.d20.srd/skills/pilot)
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) made to operate an

weapons. There is no penalty when the character operates a general-purpose
aircraft.

Special: The character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time the
character takes the feat, the character selects a different class of aircraft.
