Prerequisite: [Strength](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) 13.

Benefit: On the character’s action, before making [attack rolls](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll) for a round, the character may
choose to subtract a number from all melee [attack rolls](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll) and add the same number to all
melee [damage rolls](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage). This number may not
exceed the character’s base attack bonus.

The penalty on attacks and bonus on damage applies until the character’s next
action.
