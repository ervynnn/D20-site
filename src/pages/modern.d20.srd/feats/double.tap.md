## Double Tap

Prerequisites: [Dexterity](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) 13, [Point Blank Shot](/modern.d20.srd/feats/point.blank.shot).

Benefit: When using a semiautomatic firearm with at least two bullets loaded,
the character may fire two bullets as a single attack against a single target.
The character receives a â€“2 penalty on this
[attack](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll), but deals +1 die of
[damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) with a successful hit. Using this feat
fires two bullets and can only be done if the weapon has two bullets in it.
