## Blind-Fight

Benefit: In melee combat, every time the character misses because of
[concealment](/modern.d20.srd/combat/concealment), the character can
[reroll](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll) the miss chance roll one time to
see if the character actually hits.

The character takes only half the usual penalty to speed for being unable to
see. Darkness and poor visibility in general reduces the characterâ€™s speed to
three-quarters of normal, instead of one-half.
