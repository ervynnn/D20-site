## Combat Martial Arts

Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +1.

Benefit: With an unarmed strike, the character deals lethal or nonlethal
[damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) (the character’s choice) equal to 1d4
+ the character’s [Strength](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) modifier.
The character’s unarmed attacks count as armed, which means that opponents do
not get [attacks of opportunity](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attacks.of.opportunity) when the character
attacks them unarmed. The character may make [attacks of opportunity](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attacks.of.opportunity) against opponents
who provoke such attacks.

Normal: Without this feat, a character deals only 1d3 points of nonlethal
[damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage). Unarmed attacks normally provoke
[attacks of opportunity](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attacks.of.opportunity), and
unarmed combatants cannot normally make [attacks of opportunity](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attacks.of.opportunity).
