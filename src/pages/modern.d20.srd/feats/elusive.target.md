## Elusive Target

Prerequisites: [Dexterity](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) 13,
[Defensive Martial Arts](/modern.d20.srd/feats/defensive.martial.arts).

Benefit: When fighting an opponent or multiple opponents in melee, other
opponents attempting to target the character with [ranged attacks](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions) take a –4 penalty. This
penalty is in addition to the normal –4 penalty for firing into melee, making
the penalty to target to character –8.

Special: An opponent with the [Precise Shot](/modern.d20.srd/feats/precise.shot) feat has the penalty lessened to –4
when targeting the character.
