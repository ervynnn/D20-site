title: Improved Two-Weapon Fighting
layout: '~/layouts/MarkdownLayout.astro'
---
Prerequisites: [Dexterity](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) 13, [Two- Weapon Fighting](/modern.d20.srd/feats/two.weapon.fighting), base attack bonus
+6.

Benefit: The character gets a second
[attack](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll) with his or her offhand weapon,
albeit at a â€“5 penalty. Also, this feat allows the character to use a melee
weapon in one hand and a ranged weapon in the other.

Normal: Without this feat, a character can only get a single extra attack with
an off-hand weapon, and both weapons must be of the same type (either both
ranged weapons or both melee weapons).
