## Force Stop

Prerequisites: [Drive](/modern.d20.srd/skills/drive) 4 ranks, [Vehicle Expert](/modern.d20.srd/feats/vehicle.expert).

Benefit: When the character attempts a sideswipe
[stunt](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/stunts) with a [surface vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles), the character can
force the other vehicle to a stop by nudging it into a controlled side­ways
skid. In addition to the normal requirements for attempting a sideswipe
[stunt](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/stunts), the character
must have sufficient movement remaining to move a number of squares equal to
the character’s turn number.

After succeeding on the check to attempt the sideswipe, the character makes a
[Drive](/modern.d20.srd/skills/drive)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) opposed by the other
driver. If the character succeeds, turn the other vehicle 90 degrees across
the front of the character’s, so that they form a tee. Move them forward a
distance equal to the character’s turn number. The vehicles end their movement
at that location, at stationary speed, and take their normal [sideswipe damage](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/resolving.collisions).

If the character fails the
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics), resolve the sideswipe
normally.
