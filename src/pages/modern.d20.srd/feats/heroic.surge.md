title: Heroic Surge

Benefit: The character may take an extra [move action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/move.actions) or [attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions) in a round, either before or
after the character’s regular actions. The character may use Heroic Surge a
number of times per day depending on his or her character level (as shown
below), but never more than once per round.
