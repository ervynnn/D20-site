## Improved Damage Threshold

Benefit: The character increases his or her [massive damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/death.dying.healing) threshold by 3 points.

her current [Constitution](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) score. With
this feat, the characterâ€™s [massive damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/death.dying.healing) threshold is current
[Con](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) +3.

Special: A character may gain this feat multiple times. Its effects stack.
