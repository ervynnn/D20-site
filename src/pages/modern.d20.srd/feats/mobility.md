.

Benefit: The character gets a +4 dodge bonus to [ Defense](/modern.d20.srd/combat/defense) against [ attacks of opportunity](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attacks.of.opportunity) provoked when the character
moves out of a threatened square.

Special: A condition that makes a character lose his or her [ Dexterity](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) bonus to [ Defense](/modern.d20.srd/combat/defense) also makes the character lose dodge bonuses.
Also, dodge bonuses stack with each other, unlike most other types of bonuses.
