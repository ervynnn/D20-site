## Wealth

Every character has a [Wealth](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.bonus)[bonus](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.bonus)
that reflects his or her buying power—a composite of income, credit rating,
and savings. A character’s [Wealth bonus](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.bonus)
serves as the basis of the character’s [Wealth check](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.check), which is used to purchase
[equipment](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.general) and
[services](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/services) for the character.
