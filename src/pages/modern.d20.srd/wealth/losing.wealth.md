## Losing Wealth

Any time a character purchases an object or service with a purchase DC higher
than his or her current [Wealth bonus](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.bonus),
or one with a purchase DC of 15 or higher, the character’s [Wealth bonus](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.bonus) goes down. How much the [Wealth bonus](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.bonus) is reduced depends on how
expensive the object is.


<table> <tr><th><a href="/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.general">Object</a> or <a href="/modern.d20.srd/equipment/services">Service</a> Purchase DC</th> <th> <a href="/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.bonus">Wealth Bonus</a> Decrease</th> </tr> <tr><td> 15 or higher</td><td> +1 point<sup>1</sup> </td></tr> <tr><td> 1–10 points higher than current <a href="/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.bonus">Wealth bonus</a></td> <td> 1 point </td></tr> <tr><td> 11–15 points higher than current <a href="/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.bonus">Wealth bonus</a></td> <td> 1d6 points </td></tr> <tr><td> 16 or more points higher than current <a href="/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.bonus">Wealth Bonus</a>.</td> <td> 2d6 points </td></tr> <tr><td colspan="2" style="font-size: .8em; text-align: left"> <sup>1</sup> This stacks with the loss from a Purchase DC above the character’s current <a href="/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.bonus">wealth bonus</a>. </td> </tr> </table>



Along with this loss, any time a character buys an
[object](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.general) or
[service](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/services) with a purchase DC of 15 or
higher, the character reduces his or her current [Wealth bonus](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.bonus) by an additional 1 point.

A character’s [Wealth bonus](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.bonus) only goes
down if he or she successfully buys an
[object](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.general) or
[service](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/services). If the character attempts to
buy something and the check fails, his or her [Wealth bonus](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.bonus) is unaffected.
