##  Purchasing Equipment

[ Wealth checks ](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.check) are used to determine
what characters can afford and what [ gear ](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/index)
they might reasonably have access to. Every character has a [ Wealth bonus](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.bonus) that reflects his or her buying power.
Every [ object ](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.general) and [ service](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/services) has a purchase DC. To purchase an [object ](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.general) , make a [ Wealth check](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.check) against the purchase DC.
