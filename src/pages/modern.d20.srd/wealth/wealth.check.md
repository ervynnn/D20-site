title: Wealth Check
layout: '~/layouts/MarkdownLayout.astro'
---
A Wealth check is a 1d20 roll plus a character’s current [Wealth bonus](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.bonus). The [Wealth bonus](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.bonus) is fluid. It
[increases](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/regaining.wealth) as a character gains
Wealth and [decreases](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/losing.wealth) as the character
makes purchases.

If the character succeeds on the Wealth check, the character gains the
[object](/modern.d20.srd/equipment). If the character fails, he or she
can’t afford the [object](/modern.d20.srd/equipment) at the time.

If the character’s current [Wealth bonus](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.bonus)
is equal to or greater than the DC, the character automatically succeeds.

If the character successfully purchases an
[object](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.general) or
[service](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/services) with a purchase DC that’s higher
than his or her current [Wealth bonus](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.bonus),
the character’s [Wealth bonus decreases](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/losing.wealth).
