title: Taking 10 and Taking 20
layout: '~/layouts/MarkdownLayout.astro'
---
A character can usually take 10 or take 20 when making a [ Wealth check](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.check) . Taking 20 requires 20 times as long
as normal.

Also, there is a penalty for spending beyond a character’s means. Whenever a
character buys an [ object ](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.general) that
has a purchase DC higher than his or her current [ Wealth bonus](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.bonus) , the character’s [ Wealth bonus](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.bonus) decreases (see [ Losing Wealth](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/losing.wealth) ).
