title: Regaining Wealth
layout: '~/layouts/MarkdownLayout.astro'

A character’s [ Wealth bonus ](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.bonus) recovers
as the character advances.

Every time a character gains a new level, make a [ Profession](/modern.d20.srd/skills/profession) check. (If the character has no ranks in
the skill, this check is a [ Wisdom ](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores)
check.) The DC is equal to the character’s current [ Wealth bonus](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.bonus) . If the character succeeds, his or her
current [ Wealth bonus ](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.bonus) increases by +1.
For every 5 points by which the character exceeds the DC, he or she gains an
additional +1 to his or her [ Wealth bonus](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.bonus) .
