Buying less common [ objects ](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.general)
generally takes a number of hours equal to the purchase DC of the [ object](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.general) or [ service](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/services) , reflecting the time needed to locate
the wanted materials and close the deal. Getting a license or buying an [object ](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.general) with a [ restriction](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/restricted.objects) rating increases the time
