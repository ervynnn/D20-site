## Wealth Bonus

To determine a character’s starting Wealth bonus, roll 2d4 and add the wealth
bonus for the character’s [starting occupation](/modern.d20.srd/starting.occupation/index), plus (if appropriate)
the bonus from the [Windfall](/modern.d20.srd/feats/windfall) feat, plus 1 if
the character has ranks in [Profession](/modern.d20.srd/skills/profession).

Over the course of play, the hero’s Wealth bonus will
[decrease](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/losing.wealth) as the hero purchases
expensive [items](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/index) and
[increase](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/regaining.wealth) as the hero gains levels.

A character’s Wealth bonus can never fall below +0, and there is no limit to
how high the Wealth bonus can climb.

Since Wealth is an abstract concept, it’s sometimes difficult to determine how
financially well off a character is. To get a general sense of how financially
solvent a character is at any given time, check the table below.


<table> <tr><th>Wealth Bonus</th> <th>Financial Condition</th></tr> <tr><td> +0</td><td> Impoverished or in debt </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> +1 to +4</td><td> Struggling </td></tr> <tr><td> +5 to +10</td><td> Middle class </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> +11 to +15</td><td> Affluent </td></tr> <tr><td> +16 to +20</td><td> Wealthy </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> +21 to +30</td><td> Rich </td></tr> <tr><td> +31 or higher</td><td> Very rich </td></tr> </table>
