## The Effects of Speed

A fast-moving [vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) is
harder to hit than a stationary one—but it’s also harder to control, and to
attack from.

As shown on [Table: Vehicle Speeds and Modifiers](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/vehicle.speed), when a
[vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) travels at [street speed](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/declaring.speed) or faster,
it gains a bonus to [Defense](/modern.d20.srd/combat/defense). However, that
speed brings along with it a penalty on all [skill checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) and [attack rolls](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll) made by characters aboard the
[vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles)—including
[Drive](/modern.d20.srd/skills/drive)
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) to control the
[vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) and
[attacks](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions) made from it.
