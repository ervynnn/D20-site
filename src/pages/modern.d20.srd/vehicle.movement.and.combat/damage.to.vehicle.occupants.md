##  Damage to Vehicle Occupants

When a [ vehicle ](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) takes [damage ](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/resolving.collisions)
from a [ collision](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/collisions.ramming) , its
occupants may take [ damage ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) as well. The base
amount of [ damage ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) depends on the [ cover](/modern.d20.srd/combat/cover) offered by the [ vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) .


<table> <tr> <th> <a href="/modern.d20.srd/combat/cover"> Cover </a> </th> <th> <a href="/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage"> Damage </a> </th> </tr> <tr> <td> None </td> <td> Same as <a href="/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage"> damage </a> taken by <a href="/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles"> vehicle </a> </td> </tr> <tr class="shaded"> <td> One-quarter </td> <td> One-half <a href="/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage"> damage </a> taken by <a href="/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles"> vehicle </a> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> One-half </td> <td> One-quarter <a href="/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage"> damage </a> taken by <a href="/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles"> vehicle </a> </td> </tr> <tr class="shaded"> <td> Three-quarters or more </td> <td> None </td> </tr> </table>


Each of the occupants may make a [ Reflex save](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) (DC 15) to take half damage.
