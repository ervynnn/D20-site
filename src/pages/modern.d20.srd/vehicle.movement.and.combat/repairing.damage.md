##  Repairing Damage

[ Repairing ](/modern.d20.srd/skills/repair) [ damage](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/damaging.vehicles) to a [vehicle ](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) takes a full hour of
work, a [ mechanical tool kit](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/professional.equipment) , and a garage or some
other suitable facility. (Without the [ tool kit](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/professional.equipment) , a character takes a –4
penalty on his or her [ Repair ](/modern.d20.srd/skills/repair) [ check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) .) At the end of the hour, make a [Repair ](/modern.d20.srd/skills/repair) [ check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) (DC 20). Success restores 2d6 [ hit points ](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/damaging.vehicles) . If [damage ](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/damaging.vehicles)
remains, the character may continue to make [ repairs](/modern.d20.srd/skills/repair) for as many hours as it takes to restore all
of the [ vehicle’s ](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) [ hit points ](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/damaging.vehicles) .
