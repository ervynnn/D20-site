## Losing Control

A [collision](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/collisions.ramming)
or a failed [stunt](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/stunts) can
cause a driver to lose control of his
[vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles). In these cases, the
driver must make a [Drive](/modern.d20.srd/skills/drive)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) to retain control of the
[vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles). If this
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) is successful, the driver
maintains control of the
[vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles). If it fails, the
[vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) goes into a spin. If
it fails by 10 or more, the
[vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) rolls. Remember that
the check/roll modifier from [Table: Vehicle Speeds and Modifiers](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/vehicle.speed) applies
to all [Drive](/modern.d20.srd/skills/drive)
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

An out-of-control [vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) may
strike an object or other
[vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles). When that happens, a
[collision](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/collisions.ramming)
occurs (see [Collisions and Ramming](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/collisions.ramming)).

Spin: The [vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) skids,
spinning wildly.

At character [scale](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/scale), the
[vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) moves in its current
direction a number of squares equal to the turn number for its
[speed](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/vehicle.speed), then ends
its movement. Once it stops, roll 1d8 to determine its new facing: 1, no
change; 2, right 45 degrees; 3, right 90 degrees; 4, right 135 degrees; 5, 180
degrees; 6, left 135 degrees; 7, left 90 degrees; 8, left 45 degrees. Reorient
the vehicle accordingly.

At chase [scale](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/scale), the
[vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) moves 1 square and
ends its movement. Roll to determine its new facing as indicated above.

Roll: The [vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) tumbles,
taking
[damage](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/damaging.vehicles).

At character [scale](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/scale), the
[vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) rolls in a straight
line in its current direction for a number of squares equal to the [turn number](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/vehicle.speed) for its
[speed](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/vehicle.speed), then ends
its movement. At the end of the
[vehicle’s](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) roll, reorient the
vehicle perpendicular to its original direction of travel (determine left or
right randomly).

At chase [scale](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/scale), the
vehicle rolls one square before stopping and reorienting.

At either [scale](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/scale), a
[vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) takes
[damage](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/damaging.vehicles) equal
to 2d6 x the [character scale turn number](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/vehicle.speed) for its
[speed](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/vehicle.speed) (use the
turn number from character
[scale](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/vehicle.speed) even at
chase [scale](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/vehicle.speed)). The
[vehicle’s](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles)
[occupants](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/damage.to.vehicle.occupants)
take damage equal to 2d4 x the [character scale turn number](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/vehicle.speed) for its
[speed](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/vehicle.speed) ([Reflex save](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws), DC 15, for half damage).
