title: Damaging Vehicles
layout: '~/layouts/MarkdownLayout.astro'
---
All [vehicles](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) have [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points), which are roughly equivalent to a
character’s [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points). Like most
inanimate objects, [vehicles](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles)
also have hardness. Whenever a
[vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) takes damage, subtract
the vehicle’s hardness from the damage dealt.

When a [vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) is reduced to 0
[hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points), it is disabled. Although it
might be [repairable](/modern.d20.srd/skills/repair), it ceases functioning. A
[vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) that is disabled while
[moving](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/moving) drops one speed
category each round until it comes to a stop. The driver cannot attempt any
[maneuvers](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/simple.maneuvers)
except a [45-degree turn](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/simple.maneuvers).

Unlike characters, [vehicles](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles)
don’t “die” when they reach –10 hit points. Instead, a
[vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) is destroyed when it
loses [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) equal to twice its full
normal total. A destroyed vehicle cannot be
[repaired](/modern.d20.srd/skills/repair).

Energy Attacks: [Vehicles](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) are
treated as [objects](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.an.object) when subjected
to energy attacks.

Exploding Vehicles: If the
[attack](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/attack.options) that
disables a [vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) deals
[damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) equal to half its full normal [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) or more, the
[vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) explodes after 1d6
rounds. This explosion deals 10d6 points of [fire damage](/modern.d20.srd/environment.hazards/heat.cold) to everyone within the
vehicle ([Reflex save](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws), DC 20, for half
damage), and half that much to everyone and everything within 30 feet of the
explosion ([Reflex save](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws), DC 15, for
half damage).
