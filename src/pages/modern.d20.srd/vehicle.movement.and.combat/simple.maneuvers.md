During a [vehicle’s](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles)
[movement](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/moving), the driver can
perform any one of the following maneuvers.

45-Degree Turn: Any [vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles)
can make a simple 45-degree turn as part of its
[movement](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/moving). The
[vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) must move forward at
least a number of squares equal to its turn number (shown on [Table: Vehicle Speeds and Modifiers](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/vehicle.speed)) before
it can turn. Making a 45-degree turn costs 1 square of movement.

Ram: At [character scale](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/vehicle.speed), a driver
does not have to perform a maneuver to
[ram](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/collisions.ramming) another
[vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles)—he or she only needs
to drive his or her [vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles)
into the other [vehicle’s](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles)
square, and a
[collision](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/collisions.ramming)
occurs (see [Collisions and Ramming](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/collisions.ramming)).

At chase scale, however, more than one
[vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) can occupy the same
square and not
[collide](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/collisions.ramming)—so
[ramming](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/collisions.ramming)
another [vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) requires a
simple maneuver. The driver moves his or her
[vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) into the other
[vehicle’s](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) square and states
that he or she is attempting to
[ram](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/collisions.ramming). Resolve
the [ram](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/collisions.ramming) as a
[collision](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/collisions.ramming),
except that the driver of the target
[vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) can make a [Reflex save](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) (DC 15) to reduce the
[damage](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/damaging.vehicles) to
both [vehicles](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) by half.

Sideslip: A driver might wish to move to the side without changing the
[vehicle’s](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) facing, for instance
to change lanes. This simple maneuver, called a sideslip, allows a
[vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) to avoid obstacles or
weave in and out of traffic without changing facing. A sideslip moves a
[vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) 1 square forward and 1
square to the right or left, and costs 3 squares of movement.
