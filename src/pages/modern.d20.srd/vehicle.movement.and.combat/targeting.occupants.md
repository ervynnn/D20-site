An attack made against a [ vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) uses the [ vehicle’s](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) [ Defense](/modern.d20.srd/combat/defense) , modified by its [ speed category](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/vehicle.speed) . Attackers can
choose instead to target specific [ vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) occupants.

An attack against a [ vehicle ](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles)
occupant is made like any other [ attack ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll)
. Remember, however, that a character in a [ vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) gains bonuses to [ Defense](/modern.d20.srd/combat/defense) from both the [ vehicle’s](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) [ speed](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/vehicle.speed) and any [ cover](/modern.d20.srd/combat/cover) it provides.
