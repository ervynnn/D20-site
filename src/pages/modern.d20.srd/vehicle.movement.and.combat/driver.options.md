Here is what a [vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) driver
can do in a single round:

Choose the [Vehicle’s](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) Speed:
The driver may increase or decrease his or her
[vehicle’s](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) speed category by
one (or keep it the same).

Optional [Attack Action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions): If the driver
wants, he or she can use his or her [attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions) before moving the
[vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles). If the driver does
so, however, he or she will be limited to a single
[stunt](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/stunts) during
[movement](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/moving).

[Movement](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/moving): Move the
[vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) any number of squares
within the [vehicle’s](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) [speed category](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/declaring.speed). Along
the way, perform any number of [simple maneuvers](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/simple.maneuvers)
(limited only by their movement cost). The driver may also attempt a single
[stunt](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/stunts) as part of the
movement (or two, if the driver didn’t take his or her [attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions) before
[moving](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/moving)).

Optional [Attack Action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions): If the driver
did not take an [attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions) before
[moving](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/moving), and performed
one or fewer [stunts](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/stunts), the
driver has an [attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions) left.
