## Fiend

Fiends vary wildly. GMs are encouraged to design their own fiends using the
information provided in the Table: Outsiders and below. Several sample fiends
are given below.

### Species Traits

Fiends have the following traits.

Variable Size: Depending on their size, fiends gain a size bonus or penalty on
attack rolls, a size bonus or penalty to Defense, and a size bonus or penalty
on [Hide](/modern.d20.srd/skills/hide) checks and grapple checks. See Table:
Creature Sizes for attack and Defense modifiers based on size, as well as for
a fiend’s typical fighting space and reach.

Natural Armor: A fiend has preternaturally tough skin and gains a natural
armor bonus to Defense. The bonus depends on its size, and higher bonuses are
allowable: Tiny or smaller +2, Small +5, Medium-size +9, Large +14, Huge +16,
Gargantuan +18, Colossal +20.

Immunities (Ex): A fiend is immune to one or more specific types of
[energy](/modern.d20.srd/special.abilities/resistance.to.energy) or [weapon damage](/modern.d20.srd/special.abilities/damage.reduction). Roll on Table:
Fiend Immunities, Resistances, and [Damage Reduction](/modern.d20.srd/special.abilities/damage.reduction).

[Resistance to Energy](/modern.d20.srd/special.abilities/resistance.to.energy)
(Ex): A fiend is resistant to one or more specific types of energy damage.
Roll on Table: Fiend Immunities, Resistances, and [Damage Reduction](/modern.d20.srd/special.abilities/damage.reduction).

[Damage Reduction](/modern.d20.srd/special.abilities/damage.reduction) (Su):
Some fiends have [damage reduction](/modern.d20.srd/special.abilities/damage.reduction). Roll on Table:
Fiend Immunities, Resistances, and [Damage Reduction](/modern.d20.srd/special.abilities/damage.reduction) to determine
whether a fiend has [damage reduction](/modern.d20.srd/special.abilities/damage.reduction). If the
campaign includes few or no magic weapons, the GM should consider allowing
specific types of weapons to ignore a fiend’s [damage reduction](/modern.d20.srd/special.abilities/damage.reduction) or contrive
some other special vulnerability (see Creature Weaknesses for suggestions).

Telepathy (Su): Fiends with an Intelligence of 6 or higher can communicate
telepathically with any creature within 100 feet that has a language.

Allegiances: All fiends have a primary allegiance to evil. Fiends may also
have an allegiance to either chaos or law.

Bonus Feat: Fiends gain either [Archaic Weapons Proficiency](/modern.d20.srd/feats/archaic.weapons.proficiency) or [Simple Weapons Proficiency](/modern.d20.srd/feats/simple.weapons.proficiency) as a
bonus feat.

Automatic Languages: Fiends can speak Abyssal (the language of demons) and a
number of additional languages equal to their Intelligence bonus. Fiends with
an Intelligence of 8 or higher can also read and write these languages.

Advancement: By character class.
