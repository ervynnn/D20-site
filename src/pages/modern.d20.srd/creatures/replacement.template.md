title: Replacement (template)
layout: '~/layouts/MarkdownLayout.astro'
---
A replacement is a physical duplicate of a specific
[humanoid](/modern.d20.srd/creature.types/humanoid), called a primary.
Although a replacement does not gain the specific life experiences of its
primary, it can easily mimic the demeanor and general behavior of the primary,
enabling it to fill the same general role as the primary. A replacement is
identical in appearance to the primary except it has jet-black eyes with no
visible irises. Some replacements wear special contact lenses (purchase DC 12)
to conceal this sinister physical divergence.

Replacements are bred in laboratories. A sample of the primary’s subdermal
tissue is required to create a replacement (dead skin cells or hair follicles
will not do), and an adult replacement takes two months to grow. Creating a
replacement requires a successful [Craft (pharmaceutical)](/modern.d20.srd/skills/craft) check (DC 50). The check must
be made 1 month into the replacement’s growth period, and a failed roll
indicates the premature death of the replacement. Financing the growth and
development of a replacement also requires a successful [Wealth check](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.check) against a purchase DC of 48,
rolled before the process of growing the clone commences.

### Template Traits

“Replacement” is an inherited template that can be added to any
[humanoid](/modern.d20.srd/creature.types/humanoid) (referred to hereafter as
the original). A replacement uses all the primary’s statistics except as noted
here.

Challenge Rating: Same as the original –1.

Hit Dice: Change to one die type smaller than the primary.

Special Qualities: A replacement gains all of the original’s extraordinary
abilities but none of its supernatural or spell-like abilities (including
psionics). A replacement gains none of the original’s other special qualities
or talents. A replacement knows that it lacks some of the abilities of the
original and occasionally feels resentful toward the original for this reason.

In addition to its inherited extraordinary abilities, a replacement has the
following special quality:

Limited Existence (Ex): A replacement has a programmed natural life span of
one to four years (the creator must specify the life span when the project to
create the replacement begins). Once the replacement reaches the end of its
programmed life span, it must make a [Fortitude save](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) (DC 25) once per day. Each failed
save drains the replacement of 1d6 points of
[Constitution](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores). This ability drain
cannot be restored by any means. When its
[Constitution](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) drops to 0, the
replacement dissolves into a mass of protoplasmic goo. A replacement that dies
before this time retains the shape of the original.

Allegiances: A replacement’s primary allegiance is to its creator or owner.
This allegiance cannot be broken unless the creator or owner does something to
break it (such as by attacking the replacement).

Saves: As the original, modified by altered ability scores (see Abilities,
below).

Action Points: Replacements do not acquire or amass action points.

Abilities: As the original, except ability scores cannot exceed 12. Ability
scores of 13 or higher for the original are reduced to 12 for the replacement.
A replacement that gains levels can never raise an ability score above 12.

[Skills](/modern.d20.srd/skills): A replacement has access to any skill in
which the original has ranks, and all of a replacement’s skills are class
skills even if they are cross-class skills for the original. A replacement
gets a number of skill points per Hit Die equal to 4 + the replacement’s
Intelligence modifier (minimum 1 skill point per Hit Die). The replacement can
never have more ranks in a skill than the original.

The replacement gains a +4 species bonus on
[Disguise](/modern.d20.srd/skills/disguise) checks when impersonating the
original. The bonus increases to +10 if the replacement wears contact lenses
that hide its distinctive black eyes.

[Feats](/modern.d20.srd/feats): A replacement gains the original’s feats but
cannot use any feat for which it no longer meets the prerequisites.

Automatic Languages: A replacement can
[read](/modern.d20.srd/skills/read.write.language),
[write](/modern.d20.srd/skills/read.write.language), and
[speak](/modern.d20.srd/skills/speak.language) any language known by the
original.

Advancement: By character class.
