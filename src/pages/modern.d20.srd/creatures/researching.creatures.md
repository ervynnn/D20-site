## Researching Creatures

Researching a creature and learning its weaknesses will increase the
likelihood of victory in the ultimate confrontation.

A hero can uncover secrets about a particular creature or type of creature
through research. The success of any such endeavor is measured with
[Research](/modern.d20.srd/skills/research) skill checks.

Researching a creature takes 1d4 hours plus an additional 1d4 hours if the
creature is unique or has traits unlike other members of its species. The type
of information gleaned in this amount of time depends on the hero’s
[Research](/modern.d20.srd/skills/research) check result, as shown below.
