The caster can make him or herself—including
[clothing](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/clothing),
[armor](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/armor.general),
[weapons](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.weapons), and
[equipment](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.general)—look different. The
caster can seem 1 foot shorter or taller, thin, fat, or in between. The caster
cannot change body type. Otherwise, the changes can be as minor or as major as
the caster desires.

The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form. It
does not alter the perceived tactile (touch) or audible (sound) properties of
the caster or his or her equipment.

If a character uses this spell to create a disguise, he or she gets a +10
bonus on the [Disguise](/modern.d20.srd/skills/disguise)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

Note: Creatures get a [Will save](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) to
recognize the illusion if they interact with it.
