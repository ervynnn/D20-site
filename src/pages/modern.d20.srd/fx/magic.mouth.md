## Magic Mouth

Illusion

[Level](/modern.d20.srd/fx/level):

This spell imbues the target with an enchanted mouth that suddenly appears and
speaks its message the next time a specified event occurs. The message, which
must be twenty-five or fewer words long, can be in any language known by the
caster and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes. The mouth cannot
speak verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects.

The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to the
caster’s command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as
detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used.
Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can
fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical
darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats an
audible trigger. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or
to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are
visible or audible. A magic mouth cannot distinguish
[allegiance](/modern.d20.srd/basics/allegiances), level, HD, or class except
by external garb.

The range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level. Regardless of range,
the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line
of sight or within hearing distance.

Material Component: Purchase DC 12.
