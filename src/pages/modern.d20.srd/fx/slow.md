[Level](/modern.d20.srd/fx/level):
[Mage](/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/mage) 3;
[Components](/modern.d20.srd/fx/components): V, S, M; [Casting Time](/modern.d20.srd/fx/casting.time); [Attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions)
[Range](/modern.d20.srd/fx/range): Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels);
[Targets](/modern.d20.srd/fx/target): One creature/level, no two of which can
be more than 30 ft. apart; [Duration](/modern.d20.srd/fx/duration): 1
round/level; [Saving Throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws): Will
negates; [Spell Resistance](/modern.d20.srd/special.abilities/spell.resistance): Yes

Affected creatures move and attack at a drastically slowed rate. Slowed
creatures can take only a single [move action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/move.actions) or [attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions) each turn, but not both (nor
may they take [full-round actions](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions)). Additionally, they
suffer –2 penalties to Defense, melee [attack rolls](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll), melee
[damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) rolls, and [Reflex saves](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws). Slowed creatures
[jump](/modern.d20.srd/skills/jump) half as far as normal.

Slow counters and dispels [haste](/modern.d20.srd/fx/haste) but does not
otherwise affect magically speeded or slowed creatures.
