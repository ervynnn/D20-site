The subject appears to be about 2 feet away from his or her true location. The
subject benefits from a 50% miss chance as if he or she had total concealment.
However, unlike actual total
[concealment](/modern.d20.srd/combat/concealment), displacement does not
prevent enemies from targeting the subject normally. True seeing reveals the
subject’s true location.

Material Component: Purchase DC 9.
