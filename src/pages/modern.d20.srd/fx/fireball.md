## Fireball

Evocation [Fire]

[Level](/modern.d20.srd/fx/level):
[Mage](/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/mage) 3;
[Components](/modern.d20.srd/fx/components): V, S, M; [Casting Time](/modern.d20.srd/fx/casting.time); [Attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions)
[Range](/modern.d20.srd/fx/range): Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level);
[Area](/modern.d20.srd/fx/area): 20-ft.-radius spread;
[Duration](/modern.d20.srd/fx/duration): Instantaneous; [Saving Throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws): Reflex half; [Spell Resistance](/modern.d20.srd/special.abilities/spell.resistance): Yes

A fireball spell detonates with a low roar and deals 1d6 points of fire
[damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) per caster level (maximum 10d6) to all
creatures within the area. Unattended objects also take this damage. The
explosion creates no concussive force. The caster points his or her finger and
determines the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst.
A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the caster and, unless it impacts upon
a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range,
bursts into the fireball at that point (an early impact results in an early
detonation). If the caster attempts to send the bead through a narrow passage
the caster must “hit” the opening with a successful [ranged touch attack](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll) or else the bead strikes the
barrier and detonates prematurely. The fireball sets fire to combustibles and
damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with a low melting point. If
the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the
fireball may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it
stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.
