The caster confers on the subject the ability to see all things as they
actually are. The subject sees through normal and magical darkness, notices
secret doors hidden by magic or psionics, sees invisible creatures or objects
normally, sees through illusions, and sees the true form of changed or
transmuted things. The range of true seeing conferred is 120 feet.

True seeing, however, does not penetrate solid objects. It in no way confers
X-ray vision or its equivalent. It does not cancel concealment, including that
caused by fog and the like. True seeing does not help the viewer see through
mundane disguises, spot creatures who are simply hiding, or notice secret
panels hidden by mundane means. The effects cannot be combined with other
spells and powers.

Material Component: Purchase DC 16.
