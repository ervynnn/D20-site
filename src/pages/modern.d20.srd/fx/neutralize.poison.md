Conjuration (Healing)

[ Level ](/modern.d20.srd/fx/level) : [ Acolyte](/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/acolyte) 4; [ Components](/modern.d20.srd/fx/components) : V, S, M/DF; [ Casting Time](/modern.d20.srd/fx/casting.time) ; [ Attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions) [ Range ](/modern.d20.srd/fx/range) :
Touch; [ Target ](/modern.d20.srd/fx/target) : Creature or object of up to 1
cu. ft./level touched; [ Duration ](/modern.d20.srd/fx/duration) : 10
minutes/level; [ Saving Throw ](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) : Will
negates (harmless, object); [ Spell Resistance](/modern.d20.srd/special.abilities/spell.resistance) : Yes (harmless, object)

The caster detoxifies any sort of venom in the creature or object touched. A [poisoned ](/modern.d20.srd/environment.hazards/poison) creature suffers no
additional damage or effects from the [ poison](/modern.d20.srd/environment.hazards/poison) , and any temporary effects are
ended, but the spell does not reverse instantaneous effects, such as hit point
[ damage ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) , temporary [ ability damage](/modern.d20.srd/special.abilities/ability.score.reduction) , or effects that
don’t go away on their own.

The creature is immune to any [ poison](/modern.d20.srd/environment.hazards/poison) it is exposed to during the
duration of the spell. Unlike with delay [ poison](/modern.d20.srd/environment.hazards/poison) , such effects aren’t postponed
until after the duration—the creature is simply immune to all [ poison](/modern.d20.srd/environment.hazards/poison) effects for the length of the
spell.

This spell can instead neutralize the [ poison](/modern.d20.srd/environment.hazards/poison) in a poisonous creature or
object for the duration of the spell, at the caster’s option.
