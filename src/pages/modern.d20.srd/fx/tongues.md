This spell grants the creature touched the ability to speak and understand the
language of any intelligent creature, whether it is a species language or a
regional dialect. Tongues does not enable the subject to speak with creatures
who donâ€™t speak. The subject can make him or herself understood as far as her
voice carries. This spell does not predispose any creature addressed toward
the subject in any way.
