title: Spell Failure
layout: '~/layouts/MarkdownLayout.astro'

If a caster ever tries to cast a spell in conditions where the characteristics
of the spell (range, area, and so forth) cannot be made to conform, the effort
fails and the spell is wasted.

Spells also fail if the casterâ€™s concentration is broken. [ Arcane spells](/modern.d20.srd/fx/arcane.spells) (but not [ divine spells](/modern.d20.srd/fx/divine.spells) ) might fail if the character is wearing
armor while casting a spell that has a somatic component.
