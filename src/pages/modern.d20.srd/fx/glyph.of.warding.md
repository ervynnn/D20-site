##  Glyph of Warding

Abjuration

[ Level ](/modern.d20.srd/fx/level) : [ Acolyte](/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/acolyte) 3; [ Components](/modern.d20.srd/fx/components) : V, S, M; [ Casting Time](/modern.d20.srd/fx/casting.time) : 10 minutes; [ Range](/modern.d20.srd/fx/range) : Touch; [ Target ](/modern.d20.srd/fx/target) or
[ Area ](/modern.d20.srd/fx/area) : Object touched or up to 5 sq. ft./level; [Duration ](/modern.d20.srd/fx/duration) : Permanent until discharged (D); [Saving Throw ](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) : See text; [ Spell Resistance ](/modern.d20.srd/special.abilities/spell.resistance) : Yes
(object) This inscription harms those who enter, pass, or open the warded area
or object.

The caster sets the conditions of the ward. Typically, any creature entering
the warded area or opening the warded object without speaking a pass phrase
(which the caster sets when casting the spell) is subject to the magic it
stores. Alternatively or in addition to a pass phrase trigger, glyphs of
warding can be set according to physical characteristics or creature type, or
species. Glyphs can also be set with respect to [ allegiance](/modern.d20.srd/basics/allegiances) . They cannot be set according to class,
Hit Dice, or level. Glyphs respond to invisible creatures normally. Multiple
glyphs cannot be cast on the same area. However, they can ward separate
compartments of the same object.

The glyph can be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of the
spell’s total square footage. When the spell is completed, the glyph becomes
nearly invisible.

Glyphs cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical
probing, though they can be dispelled. Nonmagical disguises cannot fool a
glyph of warding.

Read magic allows a character to identify a glyph of warding with a successful
[ Spellcraft ](/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/mage) check (DC 13).
Identifying the glyph does not discharge it and allows the character to know
the basic nature of the glyph (version, type of damage caused, what spell is
stored).

Detecting the glyph requires a successful [ Search](/modern.d20.srd/skills/search) [ check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) (DC 28), and safely removing
it requires a successful [ Disable Device](/modern.d20.srd/skills/disable.device) [ check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) (DC 28).

Depending on the version selected, a glyph either blasts the intruder or
activates a spell.

Blast Glyph: A blast deals 1d8 points of [ damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) per two caster levels to the intruder and to
all within 5 feet of the intruder (maximum 5d8). This [ damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) is acid, cold, fire, electricity, or
sonic/concussion (caster’s choice, made at time of casting). Those affected
can make [ Reflex saves ](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) to take half [damage ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) .

Spell Glyph: The caster can store any harmful spell of up to 3rd level that he
or she knows. All level-dependent features of the spell are based on the
caster’s level at the time of casting. If the spell has targets, it targets
the intruder. If the spell normally affects an area, the area or effect is
centered on the intruder. All [ saving throws](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) operate as normal, except that the DC
is based on the level of the glyph.

Material Component: Purchase DC 15.
