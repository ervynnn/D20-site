Transmutation

[Level](/modern.d20.srd/fx/level):
[Mage](/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/mage) 3;
[Components](/modern.d20.srd/fx/components): V, S; [Casting Time](/modern.d20.srd/fx/casting.time); [Attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions)
[Range](/modern.d20.srd/fx/range): Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels);
[Targets](/modern.d20.srd/fx/target): One weapon or 50 projectiles, all of
which must be in contact with each other at the time of casting;
[Duration](/modern.d20.srd/fx/duration): 10 minutes/level; [Saving Throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws): Will negates (harmless, object);
[Spell Resistance](/modern.d20.srd/special.abilities/spell.resistance): Yes
(harmless, object)

This transmutation doubles the [threat range](/modern.d20.srd/combat/critical.hits) of the weapon. A [threat range](/modern.d20.srd/combat/critical.hits) of 20 becomes 19–20. A [threat range](/modern.d20.srd/combat/critical.hits) of 19–20 becomes 17–20. A [threat range](/modern.d20.srd/combat/critical.hits) of 18–20 becomes 15–20. The spell
can be cast only on piercing or slashing weapons (and it does not stack with
itself). If cast on arrows or crossbow bolts, the keen edge on a particular
projectile ends after one use, whether or not the missile strikes its intended
target.

This spell cannot be cast on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike.
