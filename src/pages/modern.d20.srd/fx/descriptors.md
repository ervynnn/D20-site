##  Descriptors

Descriptors are a way of classifying spells (often from different schools)
that have some common characteristic. A spellâ€™s descriptors (if any) appear in
brackets on the line identifying the school. Descriptors used for spells
include cold, electricity, fear, fire, force, language-dependent, light, mind-
affecting, and sonic.
