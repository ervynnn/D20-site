The caster instantly transfers him or herself from his or her current location
to any other spot within range. The caster always arrives at exactly the spot
desired—whether by simply visualizing the area or by stating direction. After
using this spell, the caster can’t take any other actions until his or her
next turn.

If the caster arrives in a place that is already occupied by a solid body, he
or she is transported to a random open space on a suitable surface within 100
feet of the intended location. If there is no free space within 100 feet, the
caster appears in a free space within 1,000 feet. If there’s no free space
within 1,000 feet, the spell fails and the caster remains where he or she is.
