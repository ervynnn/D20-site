The caster turns [ammunition](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/ammunitions) (such as
arrows, bolts, bullets, and shuriken) into fiery projectiles. Each projectile
deals an extra 1d6 points of fire [damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) to
any target it hits. The flaming projectiles can easily ignite flammable
materials or structures, but wonâ€™t ignite creatures struck.
