All creatures within 10 feet of the recipient, including the recipient, vanish
from sight, even from darkvision. The center of the effect is mobile with the
recipient. If the creatures are carrying gear, the gear vanishes, too. Those
affected by this spell cannot see each other but can see themselves. Any
affected creature moving out of the area becomes visible, but creatures moving
into the area after the spell is cast do not become invisible. Items dropped
or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear
if tucked into the clothing worn by the creature. Light, however, never
becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so. Any part of an
item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet beyond the
range of the spell becomes visible.

The subjects are not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can
render a recipient detectable. Affected creatures (other than the recipient)
who attack negate the invisibility only for themselves. If the spell recipient
attacks, the invisibility sphere ends. For purposes of this spell, an “attack”
includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe.
(Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character’s perceptions.)
Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm
indirectly is not an attack. If a subject attacks directly, however, it
immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Note that spells that
specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even
when they include foes in their area.

An invisible creature gains a +40 bonus on [Hide](/modern.d20.srd/skills/hide)
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) if immobile, or a +20
bonus on [Hide](/modern.d20.srd/skills/hide)
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) if moving. Pinpointing
the location of an invisible character who isn’t attempting to hide requires a
[Spot](/modern.d20.srd/skills/spot)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/spot) against DC 40 if immobile or DC
20 if moving.
