##  Target

Some spells have a specific target or targets. A caster uses these spells
directly on creatures or objects, as defined by the spell itself. The caster
must be able to see or touch the target, and must specifically choose that
target. The caster does not have to select his or her target until he or she
finishes casting the spell.

If the character casts a targeted spell on the wrong sort of target the spell
has no effect.

If the target of a spell is the caster (“Target: You”), the caster does not
receive a [ saving throw ](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) , and [ spell resistance ](/modern.d20.srd/special.abilities/spell.resistance) does not
apply.

Subject: The descriptive text of spells makes a distinction between “target”
and “subject.” The target of a spell is the creature(s) or object(s) it is
directed against. A target becomes a subject if it fails a [ saving throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) against the spell and is thus affected
by the magic.
