## Bestow Curse

Necromancy

[Level](/modern.d20.srd/fx/level):
[Acolyte](/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/acolyte) 3,
[Mage](/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/mage) 4;
[Components](/modern.d20.srd/fx/components): V, S; [Casting Time](/modern.d20.srd/fx/casting.time); [Attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions)
[Range](/modern.d20.srd/fx/range): Touch; [Target](/modern.d20.srd/fx/target):
Creature touched; [Duration](/modern.d20.srd/fx/duration): Permanent; [Saving Throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws): Will negates; [Spell Resistance](/modern.d20.srd/special.abilities/spell.resistance): Yes

The caster places a curse on the creature touched. The caster chooses one of
the three following effects, depending on the version selected:

–6 penalty to an [ability score](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores)
(minimum score of 1).

–4 penalty on attack rolls, [saving throws](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws), [ability checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics), and [skill checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

Each turn, the target has a 50% chance to act normally; otherwise, he or she
takes no action.

A character may also invent his or her own curse, but it should be no more
powerful than those described above, and the GM has final say on the curse’s
effect.

The curse cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a [break enchantment](/modern.d20.srd/fx/break.enchantment) or [remove curse](/modern.d20.srd/fx/remove.curse) spell.

Bestow curse counters [remove curse](/modern.d20.srd/fx/remove.curse).
