Conjuration (Healing)

[ Level ](/modern.d20.srd/fx/level) : [ Acolyte](/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/acolyte) 3; [ Components](/modern.d20.srd/fx/components) : V, S; [ Casting Time](/modern.d20.srd/fx/casting.time) ; [ Attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions) [ Range ](/modern.d20.srd/fx/range) :
Touch; [ Target ](/modern.d20.srd/fx/target) : Creature touched; [ Duration](/modern.d20.srd/fx/duration) : Instantaneous; [ Saving Throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) : Will half (harmless) (see text); [Spell Resistance ](/modern.d20.srd/special.abilities/spell.resistance) : Yes
(harmless)

The caster lays his or her hand upon a living creature and channels positive
energy that cures 3d8 points of [ damage ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) +1
point per caster level (up to +10).

Since [ undead ](/modern.d20.srd/creature.types/undead) are powered by
negative energy, this spell deals [ damage ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) to
them instead of curing their wounds. An [ undead](/modern.d20.srd/creature.types/undead) creature can attempt a [ Will save](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) to take half [ damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) .
