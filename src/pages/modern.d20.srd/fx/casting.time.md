## Casting Time

This entry tells how much time is needed to complete the casting of a spell
once it is begun.

Casting a spell with a casting time of 1 action is an [attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions). The spell takes effect
immediately.

Casting a spell with a casting time of 1 full round is a [full-round action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions). A character can take a
5-foot step before, during, or after casting, but you cannot otherwise move.
The spell takes effect at the beginning of that character’s turn in the round
after he or she began to cast it. The character then acts normally after the
casting is completed.

A spell that takes 1 minute to cast comes into effect just before the
character’s turn 1 minute later (the character spends each of those 10 rounds
casting as a [full-round action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions)).

When a character begins a spell that takes 1 full round or longer to cast, he
or she must continue the invocations, gestures, and/or
[concentration](/modern.d20.srd/skills/concentration) from one round to just
before his or her turn in the next round (at least). If the character loses
[concentration](/modern.d20.srd/skills/concentration) after starting the
casting and before it is complete, the spell is lost (see the
[Concentration](/modern.d20.srd/skills/concentration) skill).

A character retains his or her
[Dexterity](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) bonus to
[Defense](/modern.d20.srd/combat/defense) while casting a spell.

[Attacks of Opportunity](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attacks.of.opportunity):
Generally, if a character attempts to cast a spell, he or she provokes
[attacks of opportunity](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attacks.of.opportunity) from
threatening enemies. Table: FX Actions in Combat specifies whether a certain
activity provokes [attacks of opportunity](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attacks.of.opportunity). If a character
takes damage from an [attack of opportunity](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attacks.of.opportunity), he or she must
make a [Concentration](/modern.d20.srd/skills/concentration) check or lose the
spell he or she was trying to cast.

Casting on the Defensive: A character may attempt to cast a spell while on the
defensive. This option means casting the spell while paying attention to
threats and avoiding blows. In this case, the character are no more vulnerable
to attack than he or she would be if the character was just standing there, so
casting while on the defensive does not provoke an [attack of opportunity](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attacks.of.opportunity). It does, however,
require a [Concentration](/modern.d20.srd/skills/concentration) check (DC 15 +
spell level) to pull off. Failure means the spell is lost..
