##  Inflict Critical Wounds

Necromancy

[ Level ](/modern.d20.srd/fx/level) : [ Acolyte](/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/acolyte) 4; [ Components](/modern.d20.srd/fx/components) : V, S; [ Casting Time](/modern.d20.srd/fx/casting.time) ; [ Attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions) [ Range ](/modern.d20.srd/fx/range) :
Touch; [ Target ](/modern.d20.srd/fx/target) : Creature touched; [ Duration](/modern.d20.srd/fx/duration) : Instantaneous; [ Saving Throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) : Will half; [ Spell Resistance](/modern.d20.srd/special.abilities/spell.resistance) : Yes

The caster lays his or her hand upon a creature and channels negative energy
that deals 4d8 points of [ damage ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) +1 point
per caster level (maximum +10).

Since [ undead ](/modern.d20.srd/creature.types/undead) are powered by
negative energy, this spell cures them of a like amount of [ damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) rather than harming them.
