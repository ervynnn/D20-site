This enchantment clouds the mind of a humanoid of Medium-size or smaller so
that he takes no actions. Humanoids of 5 or more HD are not affected. The
dazed subject is not stunned (so attackers get no special advantage against
him or her), but the subject canâ€™t move, cast spells, use mental abilities, or
perform any other actions requiring awareness or concentration.
