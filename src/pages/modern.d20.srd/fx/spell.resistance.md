Spell resistance is a special defensive ability that protects against spells.

Each spell description includes an entry that indicates whether spell
resistance applies to the spell (if so, Yes; if not, No). In general, whether
spell resistance applies depends on what the spell does:

Targeted Spell: If the spell is targeted at a creature, spell resistance
applies. If the spell targets multiple specific creatures, spell resistance
applies to those individuals that have it.

Area Spell: If the target is within the area of a spell, its spell resistance
applies. The spell resistance protects the resistant creature without
affecting the spell itself.

Effect Spell: Most effect spells summon or create something and are not
subject to spell resistance. Effect spells that affect a creature more or less
directly are sometimes subject to spell resistance.

Level Check: If a spell is being resisted by a creature with spell resistance,
the caster must make a level check (1d20 + caster level) and get a result at
least equal to the creature’s spell resistance for the spell to affect that
creature. If the caster fails the check, the spell doesn’t affect the
defender. The defender’s spell resistance is like a Defense score against
magical attacks.

(Harmless) and (Object): These terms mean the same thing in a spell resistance
entry as they do for saving throws. A creature with spell resistance must
voluntarily drop the resistance in order to receive the effects of a spell
noted as harmless without the level check described above. Doing so is an
attack action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Once a creature
lowers its resistance, it remains down until the creature’s next turn, at the
beginning of which it automatically returns. A creature’s spell resistance
never interferes with its own spells, powers, items, or abilities.

Only spells and spell-like abilities are subject to spell resistance.
Extraordinary and supernatural abilities (including enhancement bonuses on
magic weapons) are not. A creature can have some abilities that are subject to
spell resistance and others that are not.

Spell resistance does not stack with power resistance, and vice versa.
