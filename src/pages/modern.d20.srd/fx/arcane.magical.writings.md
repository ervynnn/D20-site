To decipher an arcane magical writing, a character must make a successful
[Spellcraft](/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/mage) check (DC 20 + the spell’s
level). If the check fails, the character cannot attempt to read that
particular spell until the next day. A [read magic](/modern.d20.srd/fx/read.magic) spell automatically deciphers a magical
writing without a [skill check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics). If the person who
created the magical writing is on hand to help the reader, success is also
automatic.

Once a character deciphers a particular magical writing, he or she does not
need to decipher it again. Deciphering a magical writing allows the reader to
identify the spell and gives some idea of its effects (as explained in the
spell description). If the magical writing was a
[scroll](/modern.d20.srd/fx.items/scrolls) and the reader can cast [arcane spells](/modern.d20.srd/fx/arcane.spells), he or she can attempt to use the
scroll.
