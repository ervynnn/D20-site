This spell generates wholesome, drinkable water, just like clean rainwater.
Water can be created in an area as small as will actually contain the liquid,
or in an area three times as large.

Note: This spell cannot create water within a creature. Water weighs about 8
pounds per gallon. One cubic foot of water contains roughly 8 gallons and
weighs about 60 pounds.
