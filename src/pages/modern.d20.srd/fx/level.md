## Level

The relative power of a spell is indicated by its level. A spell’s level also
indicates whether a particular spellcaster is capable of preparing and casting
the spell.

Spell Slots: Every spellcaster can prepare as many spells every day as he or
she has spell slots. (See the [advance class](/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced) description for details.)

Spell slots have levels just as spells do; a spell slot of a certain level is
designed to hold a spell of that level. It’s possible, however, to place a
lower-level spell in a higher-level spell slot if you desire. A character
doesn’t have to fill all spell slots with prepared spells every day (although
it usually makes sense to do so).
