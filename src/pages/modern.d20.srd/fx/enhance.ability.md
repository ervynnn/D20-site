Transmutation

[Level](/modern.d20.srd/fx/level):
[Acolyte](/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/acolyte) 2,
[Mage](/modern.d20.srd/classes/advanced/mage) 2;
[Components](/modern.d20.srd/fx/components): V, S, M/DF; [Casting Time](/modern.d20.srd/fx/casting.time); [Attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions)
[Range](/modern.d20.srd/fx/range): Touch; [Target](/modern.d20.srd/fx/target):
Creature touched; [Duration](/modern.d20.srd/fx/duration): 1 minute/level;
[Saving Throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws): Will negates (harmless);
[Spell Resistance](/modern.d20.srd/special.abilities/spell.resistance): Yes
(harmless)

The spell grants a temporary +5 enhancement bonus to one [ability score](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) (Strength, Dexterity,
Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma) chosen by the caster at the
time of casting.

A temporary increase to Intelligence or Wisdom does not allow arcane or divine
casters to gain extra spells, but the save DCs for their spells increase. A
temporary increase in Intelligence doesn’t grant extra skill points.
