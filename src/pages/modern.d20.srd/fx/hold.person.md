The subject freezes in place, standing helpless. The subject is aware and
breathes normally but cannot take any physical actions, even speech. The
subject can, however, execute purely mental actions (including using
[psionic](/modern.d20.srd/psionics) powers).

A winged creature who is held cannot flap its wings and
