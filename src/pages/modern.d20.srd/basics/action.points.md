## Action Points

Action points provide characters with the means to affect game play in
significant ways. A character always has a limited amount of action points,
and while the character replenishes this supply with every new level he or she
attains, the character must use them wisely. A character can spend 1 action
point to do one of these things:

Alter a single d20 roll used to make an attack, a [skill check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics), an [ability check](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores), a level check, or a [saving throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws).

Use a class talent or class feature during your turn for which the expenditure
of 1 action point is required.

When a character spends 1 action point to improve a d20 roll, add 1d6 to the
d20 roll to help meet or exceed the target number. A character can declare the
use of 1 action point to alter a d20 roll after the roll is made—but only
before the GM reveals the result of that roll (whether the attack or check or
saving throw succeeded or failed). A character can’t use an action point on a
skill check or ability check when he or she is taking 10 or taking 20.

When a character spends 1 action point to use a class feature, he or she gains
the benefit of the feature but doesn’t roll a d6. In this case, the action
point is not a bonus to a d20 roll.

A character can only spend 1 action point in a round. If a character spends a
point to use a class feature, he or she can’t spend another one in the same
round to improve a die roll, and vice versa.

Depending on the hero’s character level (see the table below), he or she may
be able to roll more than one d6 when spending 1 action point. If the
character does so, apply the highest result and disregard the other rolls.
