## Death, Dying and Healing

### Injury and Death

Hit points measure how hard a character is to kill. [Hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) mean two things in the game world:
the ability to take physical punishment and keep going, and the ability to
turn a serious blow into a less serious one.


<table><tr><th> Effects of <a href="/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points">Hit Point</a> Damage</th> </tr> <tr><td>At 0 <a href="/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points">hit points</a>, a character is disabled.</td> </tr> <tr class="shaded"><td>At from –1 to –9 hit points, a character is dying.</td></tr> <tr><td>At –10 or lower, a character is dead. </td></tr></table>



### Massive Damage

Any time a character takes damage from a single hit that exceeds the
character’s massive damage threshold, that damage is considered massive
damage. A character’s massive damage threshold is equal to the character’s
current [Constitution](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) score; it can be
increased by taking the [Improved Damage Threshold](/modern.d20.srd/feats/improved.damage.threshold) feat. When a
character takes massive damage that doesn’t reduce his or her hit points to 0
or lower, the character must make a [Fortitude save](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) (DC 15). If the character fails
the save, the character’s [hit point](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) total
is immediately reduced to –1. If the save succeeds, the character suffers no
ill effect beyond the loss of hit points.

Creatures immune to [critical hits](/modern.d20.srd/combat/critical.hits) are
also immune to the effects of massive damage.

### Nonlethal Damage

Nonlethal damage is dealt by unarmed attackers and some weapons. Melee weapons
that deal lethal damage can be wielded so as to deal nonlethal damage, but the
attacker takes a –4 penalty on [attack rolls](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll) for trying to deal nonlethal damage
instead of lethal damage. A ranged weapon that deals lethal damage can’t be
made to deal nonlethal damage (unless it is used as an improvised melee
weapon).

Nonlethal damage does not affect the target’s [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points). Instead, compare the amount of
nonlethal damage from an attack to the target’s massive damage threshold. If
the amount is less than the target’s massive damage threshold, the target is
unaffected by the attack.

If the damage equals or exceeds the target’s massive damage threshold, the
target must make a [Fortitude save](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) (DC
15). If the target succeeds on the save, the target is dazed for 1 round. If
the target fails, he or she is knocked unconscious for 1d4+1 rounds.

### Disabled (0 Hit Points)

When a character’s current [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points)
drop to exactly 0, the character is disabled. The character is not
unconscious, but he or she is close to it. The character can only take a
single [move](/modern.d20.srd/combat/move.actions) or [attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions) each turn (but not both, nor
can the character take [full-round actions](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions)). The character can take
nonstrenuous [move actions](/modern.d20.srd/combat/move.actions) without
further injuring his or herself, but if the character attacks or perform any
other action the GM deems as strenuous, the character takes 1 point of damage
after completing the act. Unless the activity increased the character’s [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points), the character is now at –1 [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points), and is dying.

Healing that raises the character above 0 [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) makes him or her fully functional
again, just as if the character had never been reduced to 0 or lower. A
character can also become disabled when recovering from dying. In this case,
it’s a step up along the road to recovery, and the character can have fewer
than 0 [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) (see Stable Characters
and Recovery).

### Dying (–1 to –9 [Hit Points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points))

When a character’s current [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points)
drop below 0, the character is dying. A dying character has a current [hit point](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) total between –1 and –9 inclusive.

A dying character immediately falls unconscious and can take no actions.

A dying character loses 1 [hit point](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) every
round. This continues until the character dies or becomes stable naturally or
with help (see below).

### Dead (–10 hit points or lower)

When a character’s current [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points)
drop to –10 or lower, he or she is dead. A character can also die if his or
her [Constitution](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) is reduced to 0.

### Stable Characters and Recovery

A dying character (one with –1 to –9 hit points) is unconscious and loses 1
[hit point](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) every round until he or she
becomes stable or dies.

### Recovering without Help

Each round, a dying character makes a Fortitude [saving throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) (DC 20). If the save fails, the
character loses 1 [hit point](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) and must make
another save on his or her turn the next round.

If the save succeeds, the character becomes stable. A stable character stops
losing [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) every round, but
remains unconscious.

If no one tends to the stable character (see below), he or she remains
unconscious for 1 hour, at which point he or she makes a [Fortitude save](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) (DC 20). If the save succeeds, the
stable character regains consciousness, becoming disabled (see above). The
character’s current [hit point](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) total
remains where it is, however, even though it’s negative. If the save fails,
the character remains unconscious.

An unaided stable, conscious character who has negative [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) (and is disabled) doesn’t heal
naturally. Instead, each day the character makes a [Fortitude save](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) (DC 20) to start recovering [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) naturally that day; if the
[save](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) fails, he or she loses 1 hit
point.

Once an unaided character starts recovering [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) naturally, the character is no
longer in danger of losing additional hit points (even if his or her current
[hit point](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) total is still negative).

### Recovering with Help

A dying character can be made stable by the use of the [Treat Injury](/modern.d20.srd/skills/treat.injury) skill (DC 15). One hour after a
tended, dying character becomes stable, he or she makes a [Fortitude save](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) (DC 20) to regain consciousness.
If successful, the character becomes disabled (see above). If the character
remains unconscious, he or she makes the same [Fortitude save](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) every hour until he or she becomes
conscious. Even while unconscious, the character recovers [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) naturally, and he or she can return
to normal activity when his or her [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) rise to 1 or higher.

### Healing

After taking [damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage), a character can recover
[hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) through natural healing (over
the course of days) or through medical technology (somewhat faster). In some
campaign settings, magical healing is also available. In any case, a character
can’t regain hit points past his or her full normal total.

### Natural Healing

A character recovers 1 [hit point](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) per
character level per evening of rest (8 hours of sleep).

A character undergoing complete bed rest (doing nothing for an entire day)
recovers 2 [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) per character
level.

### Healing Ability Damage

Ability damage returns at the rate of 1 point per evening of rest (8 hours of
sleep). Complete bed rest (24 hours) restores 2 points per day.

### Temporary Hit Points

Certain effects can give a character temporary [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points). When a character gains temporary
[hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points), make a note of his or her
current [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) before adding the
temporary [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points). When the temporary
[hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) go away, the character’s [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) drop to that score. If the
character’s [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) are already below
that score at that time, all the temporary [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) have already been lost, and the
character’s [hit point](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) total does not
drop.

When temporary [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) are lost, they
can’t be restored as real [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) can
be, even with medical treatment or magic.

### Increases in [Constitution](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) Score
and Current [Hit Points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points)

An increase in a character’s
[Constitution](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) score—even a temporary
one—can give the character more [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) (an effective [hit point](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) increase), but these are not
temporary [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points). They can be
restored through normal healing. When a character’s
[Constitution](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) drops back down to its
previous score after a temporary increase, the character’s full normal [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) go down accordingly.
