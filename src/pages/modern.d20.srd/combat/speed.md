##  Speed

A character’s speed tells how far he or she can move in a move action. Humans
normally move 30 feet, but some creatures move faster or slower. Wearing armor
can slow a character down.

A character normally moves as a [ move action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/move.actions) , leaving an [ attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions) to attack. The character can,
however, use his or her [ attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions) as a second [ move action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/move.actions) . This could let the character move
again, for a total movement of up to double his or her normal speed. Another
option is to run all out (a [ full-round action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions) ). This lets the character move
up to four times his or her normal speed, but a character can only run all out
in a straight line, and doing so affects the character’s [ Defense](/modern.d20.srd/combat/defense) (see Run).
