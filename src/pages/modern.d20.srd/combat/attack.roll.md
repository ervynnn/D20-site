## Attack Roll

An attack roll represents a character’s attempts to strike an opponent on the
character’s turn in a round. When a character makes an attack roll, he or she
rolls 1d20 and adds his or her [attack bonus](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.bonus). If the result equals or beats the
target’s [Defense](/modern.d20.srd/combat/defense), the character hits and
deals [damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage). Many modifiers can affect the
attack roll.

A natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on the attack roll is always a miss. A
natural 20 (the d20 comes up 20) is always a hit. A natural 20 is also always
a threat—a possible [critical hit](/modern.d20.srd/combat/critical.hits).

If the character is not proficient in the weapon he or she is attacking with
(the character doesn’t have the appropriate Weapon Proficiency feat), that
character takes a –4 penalty on the attack roll.
