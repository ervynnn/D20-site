Combat is played out in rounds, and in each round everybody acts in turn in a
regular cycle. Combat usually runs in the following way.

1\. Each combatant starts the battle flat-footed. Once a combatant acts, he or
she is no longer flat-footed.

2\. The GM determines which characters are aware of their opponents at the
start of the battle. If some but not all of the combatants are aware of their
opponents, a [surprise round](/modern.d20.srd/combat/surprise) happens before
regular rounds begin. The combatants who are aware of their opponents can act
in the [surprise round](/modern.d20.srd/combat/surprise), so they roll for
[initiative](/modern.d20.srd/combat/initiative). In
[initiative](/modern.d20.srd/combat/initiative) order (highest to lowest),
combatants who started the battle aware of their opponents each take one
[move](/modern.d20.srd/combat/move.actions) or [attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions). Combatants who were unaware
don’t get to act in the surprise round. If no one or everyone starts the
battle aware, there is no surprise round.

3\. Combatants who have not yet rolled
[initiative](/modern.d20.srd/combat/initiative) do so. All combatants are now
ready to begin their first regular round.

4\. Combatants act in [initiative](/modern.d20.srd/combat/initiative) order.

5\. When everyone has had a turn, the combatant with the highest
[initiative](/modern.d20.srd/combat/initiative) acts again, and steps 4 and 5
repeat until combat ends.
