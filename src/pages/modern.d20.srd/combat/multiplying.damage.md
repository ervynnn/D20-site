title: Multiplying Damage
layout: '~/layouts/MarkdownLayout.astro'
---
Sometimes [ damage ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) is multiplied by some
factor. Roll the [ damage ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) (with all
modifiers) multiple times and total the results.

Bonus [ damage ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) represented as extra dice is
an exception. Do not multiply bonus [ damage ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage)
dice when a character scores a [ critical hit](/modern.d20.srd/combat/critical.hits) .
