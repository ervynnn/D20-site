title: Hit Points
layout: '~/layouts/MarkdownLayout.astro'

A character’s hit points tell how much punishment he or she can take before
dropping. Hit points are based on the character’s class and level, and the
character’s [Constitution](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) modifier
applies.

When a character’s hit point total drops to 0, he or she is disabled. When it
drops to –1, he or she is dying. When it drops to –10, the character is dead.
