## Bull Rush

A character can attempt a bull rush as an [attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions) made during his or her move
action, or as part of a charge. (In general, a character can’t make an [attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions) during a [move action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/move.actions); this is an exception.) In either
case, the character doesn’t get a 5-foot step before, during, or after the
bull rush attempt. When the character bull rushes, he or she attempts to push
an opponent straight back instead of attacking the opponent. A character can
only bull rush an opponent who is one size category larger than the character,
the same size, or smaller.

### Initiating a Bull Rush

First, the character moves into the target’s square. Moving in this way
provokes an [attack of opportunity](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attacks.of.opportunity) from each foe that
threatens the character, probably including the target.

Second, the character and the target make opposed
[Strength](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) checks. If the character and
the target are different sizes, the larger combatant gets a bonus on the
[Strength](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) check of +4 per difference
in size category. The character gets a +2 bonus if he or she was charging. The
target gets a +4 stability bonus if he or she has more than two legs or is
otherwise exceptionally stable.

### Bull Rush Results

If the character beats the target’s
[Strength](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) check, the character pushes
the opponent back 5 feet. The character can push the target back an additional
5 feet for every 5 points by which the character exceeded the target’s check
result, provided the character moves with the target. A character can’t,
however, exceed his or her normal movement for that action. (The target
provokes attacks of opportunity if moved. So does the character, if he or she
moves with the target. The target and the character do not provoke attacks of
opportunity from each other as a result of this movement.)

If the character fails to beat the target’s
[Strength](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) check, the character moves 5
feet straight back to where the character was before the character moved into
the opponents square. If that square is occupied, the character falls prone in
the square.
