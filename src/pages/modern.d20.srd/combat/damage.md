When a character hits with a
[weapon](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.weapons), he or she deals damage
according to the type of
[weapon](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.weapons). Effects that modify
[weapon](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.weapons) damage also apply to
unarmed strikes and the natural physical attack forms of creatures.

Damage is deducted from the target’s current hit points.

### Minimum Weapon Damage

If penalties to damage bring the damage result below 1, a hit still deals 1
point of damage.

### Strength Bonus

When a character hits with a melee weapon or thrown weapon, add his or her
[Strength](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) modifier to the damage.

Off-Hand Weapon: When a character deals damage with a weapon in his or her off
hand, add only half of the character’s
[Strength](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) bonus.

Wielding a Weapon Two-Handed: When a character deals damage with a weapon that
he or she is wielding two-handed, add 1.5 times the character’s
[Strength](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) bonus. However, the
character doesn’t get this higher
[Strength](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) bonus when using a light
weapon two-handed; in such a case, only the character’s normal
[Strength](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) bonus applies to the damage
roll.
