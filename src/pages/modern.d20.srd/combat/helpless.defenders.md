title: Helpless Defenders

A helpless foe—one who is bound, sleeping, unconscious, or otherwise at the
attacker’s mercy—is an easy target. A character can sometimes approach a
target who is unaware of his or her presence, get adjacent to the target, and
treat him or her as helpless. If the target is in combat or some other tense
situation, and therefore in a state of acute awareness and readiness, or if
the target can use his or her
[Dexterity](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) bonus to
[Defense](/modern.d20.srd/combat/defense), then that target can’t be
considered unaware. Further, any reasonable precaution taken by a target,
including stationing bodyguards, placing his or her back to a wall, or being
able to make [Spot](/modern.d20.srd/skills/spot)
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics), also precludes
catching that target unaware and helpless.

### Regular Attack

A helpless defender has an effective [Defense](/modern.d20.srd/combat/defense)
of 5 + his or her size modifier. If a character is attacking with a ranged
weapon and is not adjacent to the target, the character can use a [full-round action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions) to make the attack, and
gain a +5 bonus on the [attack roll](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll). If
the character is attacking with a melee weapon, or with a ranged weapon from
an adjacent square, the character can use a [full-round action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions) to deliver a coup de grace.

### Coup de Grace

As a [full-round action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions), a
character can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grace to a helpless foe.
A character can also use a ranged weapon, provided the character is adjacent
to the target. The character automatically hits and score a [critical hit](/modern.d20.srd/combat/critical.hits). If the defender survives the
[damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage), he or she still must make a
[Fortitude save](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) (DC 10 + damage dealt)
or die.

Delivering a coup de grace provokes [attacks of opportunity](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attacks.of.opportunity) from threatening
foes because it involves focused concentration and methodical action.

A character can’t deliver a coup de grace against a creature that is immune to
[critical hits](/modern.d20.srd/combat/critical.hits).

### Knockout Blow

As a [full-round action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions), a
character can make an unarmed attack or use a melee weapon that deals
nonlethal damage to deliver a knockout blow to a helpless foe. A character can
also use a melee weapon that deals lethal damage, but the character takes a –4
penalty on any attempt to deal nonlethal damage with the weapon. The target
has an effective [Defense](/modern.d20.srd/combat/defense) of 5 + his or her
size modifier. If the character hits, he or she automatically scores a
[critical hit](/modern.d20.srd/combat/critical.hits) (see [Nonlethal Damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage)).

Delivering a knockout blow provokes [attacks of opportunity](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attacks.of.opportunity) from threatening
foes because it involves focused concentration and methodical action.

A character can’t deliver a knockout blow against a creature that is immune to
[critical hits](/modern.d20.srd/combat/critical.hits).
