When a combat starts, if a character was not aware of his or her enemies and
they were aware of the character, that character is surprised. Likewise, a
character can surprise his or her enemies if the character knows about them
before they’re aware of the character.

### The Surprise Round

If some but not all of the combatants are aware of their opponents, a surprise
round happens before regular rounds begin. The combatants who are aware of the
opponents can act in the surprise round, so they roll for
[initiative](/modern.d20.srd/combat/initiative). In
[initiative](/modern.d20.srd/combat/initiative) order (highest to lowest),
combatants who started the battle aware of their opponents each take an
[attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions) or move action during
the surprise round (see [Action Types](/modern.d20.srd/combat/action.types)).
If no one or everyone is surprised, a surprise round does not occur.

### Unaware Combatants

Combatants who are unaware at the start of battle do not get to act in the
surprise round. Unaware combatants are still flat-footed because they have not
acted yet. Because of this, they lose any
[Dexterity](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) bonus to
[Defense](/modern.d20.srd/combat/defense).
