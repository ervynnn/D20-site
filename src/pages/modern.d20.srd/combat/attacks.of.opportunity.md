## Attacks of Opportunity

The melee combat rules assume that combatants are actively avoiding attacks. A
player doesn’t have to declare anything special for his or her character to be
on the defensive. Sometimes, however, a combatant in a melee lets his or her
guard down, and doesn’t maintain a defensive posture as usual. In this case,
combatants near him or her can take advantage of this lapse in defense to
attack for free. These attacks are called attacks of opportunity.

### Weapon Type

A character can use a melee weapon to make attacks of opportunity whenever the
conditions for such an attack are met (see Provoking an Attack of Opportunity,
below). In addition, a character can make attacks of opportunity with unarmed
attacks if the character’s unarmed attacks count as armed (see “Armed” Unarmed
Attacks).

### Threatened Squares

A character threatens the squares into which he or she can make a melee
attack, even when it is not the character’s action. Generally, that’s all
squares adjacent to the character’s position. An enemy that takes certain
actions while in a threatened square provokes an attack of opportunity from
the character. A character can only make attacks of opportunity with melee
weapons, never with ranged weapons.

### Provoking an Attack of Opportunity

Two actions can provoke attacks of opportunity: moving out of a threatened
square, and performing an action within a threatened square that distracts
from defending and lets the character’s guard down.

Moving out of a Threatened Square: When a character moves out of a threatened
square, that character generally provokes an attack of opportunity. There are
two important exceptions, however. A character doesn’t provoke an attack of
opportunity if all he or she moves is a 5-foot step, or if the character
withdraws. If the character doesn’t start in a threatened square, but moves
into one, the character has to stop there, or else he or she provokes an
attack of opportunity as he or she leaves that square.

Performing an Action that Distracts the Character: Some actions, when
performed in a threatened square, provoke attacks of opportunity because they
make a character divert his or her attention from the fight at hand. Using a
ranged weapon, in particular, provokes attacks of opportunity. [Table: Actions in Combat](/modern.d20.srd/combat/actions.in.combat) notes many additional
actions that provoke attacks of opportunity.

### Making an Attack of Opportunity

An attack of opportunity is a single melee attack, and a character can only
make one per round. A character does not have to make an attack of opportunity
if he or she doesn’t want to.

An experienced character gets additional regular melee attacks (by using the
full attack action), but at a lower attack bonus. A character makes his or her
attack of opportunity, however, at his or her normal [attack bonus](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.bonus)—even if the character has already
attacked in this round.
