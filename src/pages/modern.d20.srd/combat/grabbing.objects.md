##  Grabbing Objects

A character can also use [ disarm ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/disarm) to snatch
away an object worn by a target. Doing this works the same as a [ disarm](/modern.d20.srd/combat/disarm) attempt, except for the following.

[ Attack of Opportunity ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attacks.of.opportunity) : If
the target’s [ attack of opportunity](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attacks.of.opportunity) inflicts any [ damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) , the attempt to grab the object
automatically fails.

Modifiers: If the object is well secured or otherwise difficult to grab from
the target, the target gets a +4 bonus. On the other hand, if the object is
poorly secured or otherwise easy to snatch or cut away, the attacker gets a +4
bonus.

Failed Attempts: Failing an attempt to grab an object doesn’t allow the target
to attempt to [ disarm ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/disarm) the character.
