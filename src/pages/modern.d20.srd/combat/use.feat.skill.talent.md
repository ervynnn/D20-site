##  Use [ Feat ](/modern.d20.srd/feats) , [ Skill ](/modern.d20.srd/skills) ,
or Talent

Certain [ feats ](/modern.d20.srd/feats) , let a character take special
actions in combat. Other feats are not actions in themselves, but they give a
character a bonus when attempting something he or she can already do. Some
feats arenâ€™t meant to be used within the framework of combat. The individual
feat descriptions tell a character what he or she needs to know about them.

Most uses of skills or talents in a combat situation are attack actions, but
some might be [ move actions ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/move.actions) or [ full- round actions ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions) . When appropriate,
the description of a talent or a skill provides the time required to use it.
