Objects are easier to hit than characters because they usually don’t move, but
many are tough enough to shrug off some damage from each blow.

Object Defense and Bonuses to [Attack](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.bonus):
Objects are harder or easier to hit depending on their size and whether they
are immobile or being held, carried, or worn by opponents. The base Defense of
objects is shown on Table: Size and Defense of Objects.

If a character uses a [full-round action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions) to make an
[attack](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll) against an inanimate, immobile
object, the character gets an automatic hit with a melee weapon, or a +5 bonus
on his or her [attack roll](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll) with a ranged
weapon.

An object being held, carried, or worn has a
[Defense](/modern.d20.srd/combat/defense) equal to the above figure + 5 + the
opponent’s [Dexterity](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) modifier + the
opponent’s class bonus to Defense. Striking a held, carried, or worn object
provokes an [attack of opportunity](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attacks.of.opportunity) from the character
who holds it. (If a character has the Sunder feat, he or she doesn’t incur an
[attack of opportunity](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attacks.of.opportunity) for
making the attempt.)

Hardness: Each object has hardness—a number that represents how well it
resists damage. Whenever an object takes damage, subtract its hardness from
the damage. Only damage in excess of its hardness is deducted from the
object’s hit points (see Table: Substance Hardness and Hit Points and Table:
Object Hardness and Hit Points).

Hit Points: An object’s hit point total depends on what it is made of or how
big it is (see Table Substance Hardness and Hit Points and Table Object
Hardness and Hit Points).

Energy Attacks: Acid and sonic/concussive attacks deal normal damage to most
objects. Electricity and fire attacks deal half damage to most objects; divide
the damage by 2 before applying the hardness. Cold attacks deal one-quarter
damage to most objects; divide the damage by 4 before applying the hardness.

Ineffective Weapons: The GM may determine that certain weapons just can’t deal
damage effectively to certain objects.

Immunities: Objects are immune to nonlethal damage and to critical hits.

Saving Throws: Unattended objects never make [saving throws](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws). They are considered to have
failed their [saving throws](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws). An object
attended by a character (being grasped, touched, or worn) receives a [saving throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) just as if the character herself
were making the saving throw.

### Breaking Objects

When a character tries to break something with sudden force rather than by
dealing damage, use a [Strength](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) check
to see whether he or she succeeds. The DC depends more on the construction of
the object than on the material.

If an object has lost half or more of its hit points, the DC to break it
decreases by 2.

### Repairing Objects

Repairing damage to an object takes a full hour of work and appropriate tools.
(Without the tools, a character takes a –4 penalty on his or her
[Repair](/modern.d20.srd/skills/repair)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).) At the end of the
hour, make a [Repair](/modern.d20.srd/skills/repair)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) (DC 20). Success
restores 2d6 hit points. If damage remains, the character may continue to make
repairs for as many hours as it takes to restore all the object’s hit points.
