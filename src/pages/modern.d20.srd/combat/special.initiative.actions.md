title: Special Initiative Actions
layout: '~/layouts/MarkdownLayout.astro'

Usually a character acts as soon as he or she can in combat, but sometimes a
character wants to act later, at a better time, or in response to the actions
of someone else.

### Delay

By choosing to delay, the character takes no action and then acts normally at
whatever point in the [initiative](/modern.d20.srd/combat/initiative) count
the character decides to act. When a character delays, he or she voluntarily
reduces his or her own [initiative](/modern.d20.srd/combat/initiative) result
for the rest of the combat. When the character’s new, lower
[initiative](/modern.d20.srd/combat/initiative) count comes up later in the
same round, the character can act normally. The character can specify this new
[initiative](/modern.d20.srd/combat/initiative) result or just wait until some
time later in the round and act then, thus fixing the character’s new
[initiative](/modern.d20.srd/combat/initiative) count at that point.

A character cannot interrupt anyone’s action with a delayed action (as a
character can with a readied action; see below).

### Delaying Limits

The longest a character can delay before taking an action is until after
everyone else has acted in the round. At that point, the delaying character
must act or else forfeit any action in that round.

If multiple characters are delaying, the one with the highest [initiative modifier](/modern.d20.srd/combat/initiative) (or highest
[Dexterity](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores), in case of a tie) has the
advantage. If two or more delaying characters both want to act on the same
[initiative](/modern.d20.srd/combat/initiative) count, the one with the
highest [initiative modifier](/modern.d20.srd/combat/initiative) gets to go
first. If two or more delaying characters are trying to go after one another,
the one with the highest [initiative modifier](/modern.d20.srd/combat/initiative) gets to go last; the others must
go first or lose their action for the round.

If a character loses an action due to delaying, he or she may act on any count
on the next turn. Again, the character cannot interrupt an action.

### Ready

The ready action lets a character prepare to take an action later, to
interrupt another character. Essentially, the character splits his or her
action, taking the [move action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/move.actions) on the
character’s [initiative](/modern.d20.srd/combat/initiative) count and the
[attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions) at a later point. On
the character’s turn, he or she prepares to take an action later, if a
specific trigger is met. Then, later in the round, if the readied action is
triggered, the character takes it, acting before the triggering action.

Readying does not provoke an [attack of opportunity](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attacks.of.opportunity). (The character’s
[move action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/move.actions), and the [attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions) he or she readies, may both
provoke [attacks of opportunity](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attacks.of.opportunity) normally.)

### Readying an Action

A character can ready an [attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions) or a [move action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/move.actions). To do so, the character
specifies the action he or she will take and the conditions under which the
character will take it. Then, any time before the character’s next action, the
character may take the readied [attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions) in response to those
conditions. The readied action occurs just before the event that triggers it.
If the trigger is part of another character’s actions, the readied action
interrupts the other character. The other character continues his or her
actions once the readied action is completed.

The character’s [initiative](/modern.d20.srd/combat/initiative) count changes.
For the rest of the encounter, it is the count on which the character took the
readied action, and the character acts immediately ahead of the character
whose action triggered the readied action.

A character can take a 5-foot step as part of his or her readied action, but
only if the character didn’t otherwise move any distance during the round.

If the character comes to his or her next action and has not yet performed the
readied action, the character doesn’t get to take the readied action (though
the character can ready the same action again). If the character takes his or
her readied action in the next round, before his or her regular turn comes up,
the character’s initiative count rises to that new point in the order of
battle, and he or she does not get your regular action that round.
