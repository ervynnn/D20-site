In combat, a character can help a friend attack or defend by distracting or
interfering with an opponent. If the character is in position to
[attack](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll) an opponent with which a friend
of the character is engaged in melee combat, the character can attempt to aid
the friend as an [attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions). The
character makes an attack roll against
[Defense](/modern.d20.srd/combat/defense) 10\. If the character succeeds, he
or she doesn’t actually damage the opponent—but the character’s friend gains
either a +2 circumstance bonus against that opponent or a +2 circumstance
bonus to [Defense](/modern.d20.srd/combat/defense) against that opponent
(aiding character’s choice) on the friend’s next turn.
