When a character takes [ damage ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) from an
attack with a poisoned weapon, touches an item smeared with contact poison,
consumes a poisonous substance, inhales a poisonous gas, or is otherwise
poisoned, the character must make a Fortitude [ saving throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) . If the character fails, he or she
takes the poison’s initial [ damage ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) (usually
[ ability ](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) damage). Even if the
character succeeds, he or she typically faces secondary [ damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) 1 minute later. This secondary [ damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) also requires a Fortitude [ saving throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) to avoid.

Poisons are detailed in the [ Craft (chemical)](/modern.d20.srd/skills/craft.chemical) skill description.

Poisonous liquids are usually administered through injection or by application
to a weapon. Poisonous gases must be inhaled to be effective. Poisonous solids
are usually ingested with food or drink.

###  Perils of Using Poison

A character has a 5% chance (roll of 1 on 1d20) to expose him or herself to a
poison whenever the character applies it to a weapon or otherwise readies it
for use. Additionally, a character who rolls a 1 on an [ attack roll](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll) with a poisoned weapon must succeed at a
Reflex [ saving throw ](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) (DC 15) or
accidentally poison him or herself with the weapon.

###  Poison Immunity

Creatures with natural poison attacks are immune to their own poison.
Nonliving creatures and creatures without metabolisms are immune to poison.
Oozes and certain kinds of creatures are immune to poison, as detailed in
their descriptions, though it is conceivable that a special poison could be
synthesized specifically to harm them.
