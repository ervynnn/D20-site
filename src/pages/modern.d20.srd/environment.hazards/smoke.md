##  Smoke

Characters breathing heavy smoke or similar toxic gases must make a [Constitution ](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) check (DC 10, +1 for
each previous check) each round or spend that round choking and coughing.
Characters who choke for 2 consecutive rounds take 1d6 points of [ damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) .

Smoke also obscures vision, giving one-half [ concealment](/modern.d20.srd/combat/concealment) (20% miss chance) to characters within
it.
