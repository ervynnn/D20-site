Sometimes heroes might find themselves without food and water. In normal
climates, heroes need at least 1/2 gallon of fluids and about 1/4 pound of
decent food per day to avoid the threat of starvation. In very hot climates,
heroes need two or three times as much water to avoid dehydration.

A character can go without water for one day plus a number of hours equal to
his or her [ Constitution ](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) score.
After this, the character must make a [ Constitution](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) check each hour (DC 10, +1 for each
previous check) or take 1d6 points of [ damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) .

A character can go without food for three days, in growing discomfort. After
this, the character must make a [ Constitution](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) check each day (DC 10, +1 for each
previous check) or sustain 1d6 points of [ damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) .

[ Damage ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) from thirst or starvation cannot be
recovered until the hero gets water or food, as needed. Even magical or
psionic effects that restore [ hit points ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points)
cannot heal this [ damage ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) .
