A character takes 1d6 points of [ damage ](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) for
every 10 feet of a fall, to a maximum of 20d6 points. If the character
succeeds on a Reflex [ saving throw ](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws)
(DC 10, +1 for each 10 feet fallen), this damage is halved. If the [ saving throw ](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) fails, full [ damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) is applied.

A character can make a [ Tumble ](/modern.d20.srd/skills/tumble) [ check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) (DC 15) to treat a fall as if
it were 10 feet shorter when determining the [ damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) and Reflex [ saving throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) DC required by the fall.
