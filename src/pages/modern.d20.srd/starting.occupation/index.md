## Starting Occupation

A hero may hold other jobs as his or her career unfolds, but the benefits of a
starting occupation are only applied once, at the time of character creation.

Many starting occupations have a prerequisite that the character must meet to
qualify for the occupation. Each occupation provides a number of additional
permanent class [skills](/modern.d20.srd/skills/index) that the character can
select from a list of choices. Once selected, a permanent class
[skill](/modern.d20.srd/skills/index) is always considered to be a class
[skill](/modern.d20.srd/skills/index) for the character. If the
[skill](/modern.d20.srd/skills/index) selected is already a class
[skill](/modern.d20.srd/skills/index) for the character, he or she also gains
a one-time competence bonus for that [skill](/modern.d20.srd/skills/index).

Some starting occupations provide a
[Reputation](/modern.d20.srd/reputation/index) bonus or a bonus
[feat](/modern.d20.srd/feats/index) (in addition to the two
[feats](/modern.d20.srd/feats/index) a 1st-level character already receives).
A character still must meet any prerequisites for these bonus
[feats](/modern.d20.srd/feats/index). Finally, a starting occupation increases
the character’s [Wealth bonus](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.bonus).

Choose one occupation from the available selections and apply the benefits to
the character as noted in the occupation’s description.
