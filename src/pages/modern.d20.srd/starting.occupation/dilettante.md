Dilettantes usually get their wealth from family holdings and trust funds. The
typical dilettante has no job, few re­sponsibilities, and at least one driving
passion that ­occupies his or her day. That passion might be a charity or
philanthropic foundation, an ideal or cause worth fighting for, or a lust for
living a fun and carefree existence.
