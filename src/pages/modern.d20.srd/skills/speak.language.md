The Speak Language skill doesn’t work like a standard skill.

  * A character automatically knows how to speak his or her native language; the character does not need ranks to do so.
  * Each additional language costs 1 rank. When a character adds a rank to Speak Language, he or she chooses a new language that he or she can speak.
  * A character never makes Speak Language [checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics). A character either knows how to speak and understand a specific language or doesn’t.
  * To be able to read and write a language that the character can speak, he or she must take the [Read/Write Language](/modern.d20.srd/skills/read.write.language) skill for the appropriate language.
  * A character can choose any language, modern or ancient. (See the table accompanying [Read/Write Language](/modern.d20.srd/skills/read.write.language) for suggestions.) The GM might determine that a character can’t learn a specific language due to the circumstances of the campaign.
