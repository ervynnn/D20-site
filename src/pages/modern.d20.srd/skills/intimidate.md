## Intimidate ([Cha](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores))

[Check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill): With a successful
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill), a character can
forcibly persuade another character to perform some task or behave in a
certain way. A character’s Intimidate
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) is opposed by the
target’s level check (1d20 + the target’s character level or Hit Dice). Any
modifiers that a target may have on [Will saving throws](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) against fear effects apply to
this level check. If the character succeeds, he or she may treat the target as
friendly for 10 minutes, but only for purposes of actions taken while in the
character’s presence. (That is, the target retains his or her normal attitude,
but will chat, advise, offer limited help, or advocate on the character’s
behalf while intimidated.)

Circumstances dramatically affect the effectiveness of an Intimidate
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill).

There are limits to what a successful Intimidate
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) can do.

The character can’t force someone to obey his or her every command or do
something that endangers that person’s life.

If the character fails by more than 5, the target may actually do the opposite
of what the character wishes.

Try Again?: No. Even if the initial
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) succeeds, the other
character can only be intimidated so much, and trying again doesn’t help. If
the initial [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) fails, the
other character has become more firmly resolved to resist the intimidator, and
trying again is futile.

Special: A character can [take 10](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#take10) when making an Intimidate
check, but can’t [take 20](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#take20).

A character immune to fear effects can’t be intimidated.

A character may add a +2 bonus to his or her Intimidate
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) for every size category
the character is larger than his or her target. Conversely, the character
takes a –2 penalty to his or her
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) for every size category
the character is smaller than his or her target.

A character with the [Confident](/modern.d20.srd/feats/confident) feat gets a
+2 bonus on all Intimidate
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) and on level checks to
resist intimidation.

Time: An Intimidate [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) is
a [full-round action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions).
