[Check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill): A character’s Move
Silently [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) is opposed by
the [Listen](/modern.d20.srd/skills/listen)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) of anyone who might
hear the character. A character can move up to half his or her normal speed at
no penalty. At more than half speed and up to the character’s full speed, he
or she takes a –5 penalty. It’s practically impossible (–20 penalty) to move
silently while [attacking](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions), running, or
charging.

Silently [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill), but can’t
[take 20](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#take20).

A character with the [Stealthy](/modern.d20.srd/feats/stealthy) feat gets a +2

Time: Move Silently is a [move action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/move.actions).
