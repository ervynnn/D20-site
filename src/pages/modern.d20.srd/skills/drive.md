[Check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics): Routine tasks, such as
ordinary driving, don’t require a [skill check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics). Make a
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) only when some unusual
circumstance exists (such as inclement weather or an icy surface), or when the
character is driving during a dramatic situation (the character is being
chased or attacked, for example, or is trying to reach a destination in a
limited amount of time). When driving, the character can attempt simple
maneuvers or stunts. See [Driving a Vehicle](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat) for more details.

Try Again?: Most driving checks have consequences for failure that make trying
again impossible.

Special: A character can [take 10](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) when driving, but can’t
[take 20](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

A character with the [Vehicle Expert](/modern.d20.srd/feats/vehicle.expert)
feat gets a +2 bonus on all Drive
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

There is no penalty for operating a general-purpose motor vehicle. Other types
of motor vehicles (heavy wheeled, powerboat, sailboat, ship, and tracked)
require the corresponding [Surface Vehicle Operation](/modern.d20.srd/feats/surface.vehicle.operation) feat, or the
character takes a –4 penalty on Drive
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

Time: A Drive [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) is a
[move action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/move.actions).
