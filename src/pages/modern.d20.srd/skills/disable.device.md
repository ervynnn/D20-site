## Disable Device ([Int](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores)) [Trained Only](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics)

[Check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics): The GM makes the
Disable Device [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) so that
the character doesn’t necessarily know whether he or she has succeeded.

Open Lock: A character can pick conventional locks, finesse combination locks,
and bypass electronic locks. The character must have a [lockpick set](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/professional.equipment) (for a mechanical lock)
or an [electrical tool kit](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/professional.equipment)
(for an electronic lock). The DC depends on the quality of the lock.


<table> <tr><th> Lock Type (Example)</th> <th>DC</th> </tr> <tr><td> Cheap (briefcase lock)</td><td> 20 </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> Average (home deadbolt)</td><td> 25 </td></tr> <tr><td> High quality (business deadbolt)</td><td> 30 </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> High security (branch bank vault)</td><td> 40 </td></tr> <tr><td> Ultra-high security (bank headquarters vault)</td><td> 50 </td></tr> </table>



Disable Security Device: A character can disable a security device, such as an
electric fence, motion sensor, or security camera. The character must be able
to reach the actual device. If the device is monitored, the fact that the
character attempted to disable it will probably be noticed.

When disabling a monitored device, the character can prevent his or her
tampering from being noticed. Doing so requires 10 minutes and an [electrical tool kit](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/professional.equipment), and increases the
DC of the [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) by +10.


<table> <tr><th>Device Type (Example)</th> <th>DC</th> </tr> <tr><td> Cheap (home door alarm)</td><td> 20 </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> Average (store security camera)</td><td> 25 </td></tr> <tr><td> High quality (art museum motion detector)</td><td> 30 </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> High security (bank vault alarm)</td><td> 35 </td></tr> <tr><td> Ultrahigh security (motion detector at Area 51)</td><td> 40 </td></tr> </table>



Traps and Sabotage: Disabling (or rigging or jamming) a simple mechanical
device has a DC of 10. More intricate and complex devices have higher DCs. The
GM rolls the [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics). If the
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) succeeds, the character
disables the device. If the check fails by 4 or less, the character has failed
but can try again. If the character fails by 5 or more, something goes wrong.
If it’s a trap, the character springs it. If it’s some sort of sabotage, the
character thinks the device is disabled, but it still works normally.

A character can rig simple devices to work normally for a while and then fail
some time later (usually after 1d4 rounds or minutes of use).

Try Again?: Yes, though the character must be aware that he or she has failed
in order to try again.

Special: A character can [take 10](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) when making a Disable
Device [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics). A character can
[take 20](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) to open a lock or to
disable a security device, unless the character is trying to prevent his or
her tampering from being noticed. Possessing the proper tools gives a
character the best chance of succeeding on a Disable Device
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics). Opening a lock
requires a [lockpick set](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/professional.equipment)
(for a mechanical lock) or an [electrical tool kit](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/professional.equipment) (for an electronic
lock). Opening a locked car calls for a [car opening kit](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/professional.equipment). Disabling a security
device requires either a [mechanical tool kit](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/professional.equipment) or an [electronic toll kit](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/professional.equipment), depending on the
nature of the device. If the character does not have the appropriate tools, he
or she takes a –4 penalty on your
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

A [lock release gun](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/professional.equipment) can
open a mechanical lock of cheap or average quality without a Disable Device
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics). A character with the
[Cautious](/modern.d20.srd/feats/cautious) feat and at least 1 rank in this
skill gets a +2 bonus on all Disable Device
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

Time: Disabling a simple mechanical device is a [full-round action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions). Intricate or complex
devices require 2d4 rounds.
