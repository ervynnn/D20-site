## Listen ([Wis](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores))

[Check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics): Make a Listen
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) against a DC that
reflects how quiet the noise is that a character might hear or against an
opposed [Move Silently](/modern.d20.srd/skills/move.silently)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

The GM may call for a Listen
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) by a character who is
in a position to hear something. A character can also make a Listen
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) voluntarily if he or
she wants to try to hear something in the character’s vicinity.

The GM may make the Listen
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) in secret so that the
character doesn’t know whether not hearing anything means that nothing is
there or that the character failed the
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

A successful Listen [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics)
when there isn’t anything to hear results in the character hearing nothing.

Try Again?: A character can make a Listen
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) every time he or she
has the opportunity to hear something in a reactive manner. As a [move action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/move.actions), the character may attempt to
hear something that he or she failed (or believes he or she failed) to hear
previously.

Special: When several characters are listening to the same thing, the GM can
make a single 1d20 roll and use it for all the listeners’ skill
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

A character can [take 10](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) or
[take 20](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) when making a Listen
check. [Taking 20](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) means the
character spends 1 minute attempting to hear something that may or may not be
there to hear.

A character with the [Alertness](/modern.d20.srd/feats/alertness) feat gets a
+2 bonus on all Listen
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

A sleeping character can make Listen
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics), but takes a –10
penalty on the [checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

Time: A Listen [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) is
either a reaction (if called for by the GM) or a [move action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/move.actions) (if a character actively takes
the time to try to hear something).
