## Balance ([Dex](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores)) [Armor Penalty](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/armor.general)

[Check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics): The character can walk
on a precarious surface. A successful
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) lets the character move
at half his or her speed along the surface as a move action. A failure
indicates that the character spends his or her [move action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/move.actions) keeping his or her balance and
does not move. A failure by 5 or more indicates that the character falls.

The difficulty varies with the conditions of the surface.


<table> <tr><th>Narrow Surface</th> <th>DC*</th><th> Difficult Surface</th> <th> DC</th> </tr> <tr><td> 7–12 in. wide</td><td> 10</td><td> Uneven or angled</td><td> 10 </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> 2–6 in. wide</td><td> 15</td><td> Slippery surface</td><td> 10 </td></tr> <tr><td> Less than 2 in. wide</td><td> 20</td><td> </td><td> </td></tr> </table>


*Add +5 to the DC if the narrow surface is slippery or angled; add +10 if it is both slippery and angled.

Being Attacked While Balancing: While balancing, the character is flat-footed
(the character loses his or her [Dexterity](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores)bonus to
[Defense](/modern.d20.srd/combat/defense), if the character has one), unless
the character has 5 or more ranks in Balance. If the character takes
[damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage), he or she must make a Balance
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) again to remain
standing.

Accelerated Movement: The character can try to cross a precarious surface more
quickly than normal. The character can move his or her full speed, but the
character takes a –5 penalty on his or her Balance
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics). (Moving twice the
character’s speed in a round requires two
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics), one for each [move action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/move.actions).)

The character can attempt to charge across a precarious surface. Charging
requires one Balance [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) at
a –5 penalty for each multiple of the character’s speed (or fraction thereof)
that the character charges.

Special: A character can [take 10](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) when making a Balance
check, but can’t [take 20](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

A character with the [Focused](/modern.d20.srd/feats/focused) feat gets a +2
bonus on all Balance [checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

Time: Balancing while moving one-half the character’s speed is a [move action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/move.actions).

Accelerated movement, allowing the character to balance while moving his or
her full speed, is also a [move action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/move.actions).
