## Disguise ([Cha](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores))

[Check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics): A character’s Disguise
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) result determines how
good the disguise is. It is opposed by others’
[Spot](/modern.d20.srd/skills/spot)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) results. Make one
Disguise [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) even if
several people make Spot checks. The GM makes the character’s Disguise
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) secretly so that the
character is not sure how well his or her disguise holds up to scrutiny.

If the character doesn’t draw any attention to him or herself, however, others
don’t get to make [Spot](/modern.d20.srd/skills/spot)
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics). If the character
comes to the attention of people who are suspicious, the suspicious person
gets to make a [Spot](/modern.d20.srd/skills/spot)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics). (The GM can assume
that such observers [take 10](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics)
on their [Spot](/modern.d20.srd/skills/spot)
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).)

The effectiveness of the character’s disguise depends in part on how much the
character is attempting to change his or her appearance.

If the character is impersonating a particular individual, those who know what
that person looks like automatically get to make
[Spot](/modern.d20.srd/skills/spot)
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics). Furthermore, they get
a bonus on their [Spot](/modern.d20.srd/skills/spot)
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

Usually, an individual makes a [Spot](/modern.d20.srd/skills/spot)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) to detect a disguise
immediately upon meeting the character and each hour thereafter. If the
character casually meets many different people, each for a short time, the GM
checks once per day or hour, using an average
[Spot](/modern.d20.srd/skills/spot) modifier for the group (assuming they
[take 10](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics)).

Try Again?: No, though the character can assume the same disguise again at a
later time. If others saw through the previous disguise, they are
automatically treated as suspicious if the character assumes the same disguise
again.

Special: A character can [take 10](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) or [take 20](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) when establishing a
disguise.

A character without a [disguise kit](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/professional.equipment) takes a –4 penalty on
Disguise [checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

A character with the [Deceptive](/modern.d20.srd/feats/deceptive) feat gets a
+2 bonus on all Disguise
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

A character can help someone else create a disguise for him or her, treating
it as an [aid another](/modern.d20.srd/combat/aid.another) attempt.

Time: A Disguise [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics)
requires 1d4 x10 minutes of preparation. The GM makes
[Spot](/modern.d20.srd/skills/spot)
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) for those who
encounter the character immediately upon meeting the character and again each
hour or day thereafter, depending on circumstances.
