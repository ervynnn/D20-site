## Read/Write Language (None) [Trained Only](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics)

The Read/Write Language skill doesn’t work like a standard skill.

  * A character automatically knows how to read and write his or her native language; the character does not need ranks to do so.
  * Each additional language costs 1 rank. When a character adds a rank to Read/Write Language, he or she chooses a new language that the character can read and write.
  * A character never makes Read/Write Language [checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill). A character either knows how to read and write a specific language or doesn’t.
  * To be able to speak a language that the character can read and write, he or she must take the [Speak Language](/modern.d20.srd/skills/speak.language) skill for the appropriate language.
  * A character can choose any language, modern or ancient. (See below for suggestions.) The GM might determine that a character can’t learn a specific language due to the circumstances of the campaign.

Language Groups

There are thousands of languages to choose from when a character buys ranks in
[Speak Language](/modern.d20.srd/skills/speak.language) or Read/Write
Language. A few are listed here, sorted into their general language groups.

A language’s group doesn’t matter when a character is buying ranks in [Speak Language](/modern.d20.srd/skills/speak.language) or Read/Write Language.
Language groups are provided because they pertain to the [Smart hero’s](/modern.d20.srd/classes/basic/smart.hero) Linguist talent.

This list is by no means exhaustive—there are many more language groups, and
most groups contain more languages than those listed here.
