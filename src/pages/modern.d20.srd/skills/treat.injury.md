## Treat Injury ([Wis](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores))

[Check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill): The DC and effect
depend on the task attempted.

Long-Term Care (DC 15): With a [medical kit](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/professional.equipment), the successful
application of this skill allows a patient to recover hit points and ability
points lost to temporary damage at an advanced rate—3 [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) per character level or 3 [ability points](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) restored per day of complete
rest. A new [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) is made
each day; on a failed [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill),
recovery occurs at the normal rate for that day of rest and care.

A character can tend up to as many patients as he or she has ranks in the
skill. The patients need complete bed rest (doing nothing all day). The
character needs to devote at least ½ hour of the day to each patient the
character is caring for.

Restore Hit Points (DC 15): With a [medical kit](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/professional.equipment), if a character has
lost [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points), the character can
restore some of them. A successful
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill), as a [full-round action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions), restores 1d4 hit points.
The number restored can never exceed the character’s full normal total of [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points). This application of the skill can
be used successfully on a character only once per day.

Revive [Dazed](/modern.d20.srd/conditions/index),
[Stunned](/modern.d20.srd/conditions/index), or
[Unconscious](/modern.d20.srd/conditions/index) Character (DC 15): With a
[first aid kit](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/professional.equipment), the
character can remove the [dazed](/modern.d20.srd/conditions/index),
[stunned](/modern.d20.srd/conditions/index), or
[unconscious](/modern.d20.srd/conditions/index) condition from a character.
This check is an [attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions).

A successful check removes the [dazed](/modern.d20.srd/conditions/index),
[stunned](/modern.d20.srd/conditions/index), or
[unconscious](/modern.d20.srd/conditions/index) condition from an affected
character. The character can’t revive an unconscious character who is at –1
[hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) or lower without first
stabilizing the character.

Stabilize Dying Character (DC 15): With a [medical kit](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/professional.equipment), a character can tend
to a character who is dying. As an [attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions), a successful Treat Injury
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) stabilizes another
character. The stabilized character regains no [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points), but he or she stops losing them.
The character must have a [medical kit](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/professional.equipment) to stabilize a dying
character.

Surgery (DC 20): With a [surgery kit](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/professional.equipment), a character can
conduct field surgery. This application of the Treat Injury skill carries a –4
penalty, which can be negated with the
[Surgery](/modern.d20.srd/feats/surgery) feat. Surgery requires 1d4 hours; if
the patient is at negative [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points),
add an additional hour for every point below 0 the patient has fallen.

Surgery restores 1d6 [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) for every
character level of the patient (up to the patient’s full normal total of [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points)) with a successful skill
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill). Surgery can only be
used successfully on a character once in a 24-hour period. A character who
undergoes surgery is fatigued for 24 hours, minus 2 hours for every point
above the DC the surgeon achieves. The period of fatigue can never be reduced
below 6 hours in this fashion.

Treat [Disease](/modern.d20.srd/environment.hazards/disease) (DC 15): A
character can tend to a character infected with a treatable
[disease](/modern.d20.srd/environment.hazards/disease). Every time the
[diseased](/modern.d20.srd/environment.hazards/disease) character makes a
saving throw against [disease](/modern.d20.srd/environment.hazards/disease)
effects (after the initial contamination), the treating character first makes
a Treat Injury [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) to help
the [diseased](/modern.d20.srd/environment.hazards/disease) character fend off
secondary damage. This activity takes 10 minutes. If the treating character’s
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) succeeds, the treating
character provides a bonus on the diseased character’s [saving throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) equal to his or her ranks in this
skill.

Treat [Poison](/modern.d20.srd/environment.hazards/poison) (DC 15): A
character can tend to a poisoned character. When a poisoned character makes a
[saving throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) against a
[poison’s](/modern.d20.srd/environment.hazards/poison) secondary effect, the
treating character first makes a Treat Injury
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) as an [attack action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.actions). If the treating character’s
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) succeeds, the character
provides a bonus on the poisoned character’s [saving throw](/modern.d20.srd/basics/saving.throws) equal to his or her ranks in this
skill.

Try Again?: Yes, for restoring [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points), reviving
[dazed](/modern.d20.srd/conditions/index),
[stunned](/modern.d20.srd/conditions/index), or [unconscious characters](/modern.d20.srd/conditions/index), stabilizing dying characters,
and surgery. No, for all other uses of the skill.

Special: The [Surgery](/modern.d20.srd/feats/surgery) feat gives a character
the extra training he or she needs to use Treat Injury to help a wounded
character by means of an operation.

A character can [take 10](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#take10) when
making a Treat Injury [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill).
A character can [take 20](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#take20) only
when restoring [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points) or attempting
to revive [dazed](/modern.d20.srd/conditions/index),
[stunned](/modern.d20.srd/conditions/index), or [unconscious characters](/modern.d20.srd/conditions/index).

Long-term care, restoring [hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points),
treating [disease](/modern.d20.srd/environment.hazards/disease), treating
[poison](/modern.d20.srd/environment.hazards/poison), or stabilizing a dying
character requires a [medical kit](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/professional.equipment). Reviving a
[dazed](/modern.d20.srd/conditions/index),
[stunned](/modern.d20.srd/conditions/index), or [unconscious characters](/modern.d20.srd/conditions/index) requires either a [first aid kit](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/professional.equipment) or a [medical kit](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/professional.equipment). Surgery requires a
[surgery kit](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/professional.equipment). If the
character does not have the appropriate kit, he or she takes a –4 penalty on
the [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill).

A character can use the Treat Injury skill on his or herself only to restore
[hit points](/modern.d20.srd/combat/hit.points), treat
[disease](/modern.d20.srd/environment.hazards/disease), or treat
[poison](/modern.d20.srd/environment.hazards/poison). The character takes a –5
penalty on your [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) any
time he or she treats his or herself.

A character with the [Medical Expert](/modern.d20.srd/feats/medical.expert)
feat gets a +2 bonus on all Treat Injury
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill).

Time: Treat Injury [checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill)
take different amounts of time based on the task at hand, as described above.
