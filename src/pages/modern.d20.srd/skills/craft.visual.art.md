## Craft (Visual Art) ([Int](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores))

This skill allows a character to create paintings or drawings, take
photographs, use a video camera, or in some other way create a work of visual
art.

When attempting to create a work of visual art, the character simply makes a
Craft (visual art) [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics), the
result of which determines the quality of the work.

Unless the effort is particularly elaborate or the character must acquire an
expensive piece of equipment, the basic components have a [purchase DC](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.check) of 5.


<table> <tr><th>Skill Check Result</th> <th>Effort Achieved</th></tr> <tr><td> 9 or lower</td><td> Untalented amateur </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> 10–19</td><td> Talented amateur </td></tr> <tr><td> 20–24</td><td> Professional </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> 25–30</td><td> Expert </td></tr> <tr><td> 31 or higher</td><td> Master </td></tr> </table>


Creating a work of visual art requires at least a [full-round action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions), but usually takes an hour,
a day, or more, depending on the scope of the project.

Special: A character with the [Creative](/modern.d20.srd/feats/creative) feat
gets a +2 bonus on all Craft (visual art)
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).
