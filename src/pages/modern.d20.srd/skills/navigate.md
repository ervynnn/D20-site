## Navigate ([Int](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores))

[Check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill): Make a Navigate
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) when a character is
trying to find his or her way to a distant location without directions or
other specific guidance. Generally, a character does not need to make a
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) to find a local street
or other common urban site, or to follow an accurate map. However, the
character might make a [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill)
to wind his or her way through a dense forest or a labyrinth of underground
storm drains.

For movement over a great distance, make a Navigate
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill). The DC depends on the
length of the trip. If the character succeeds, he or she moves via the best
reasonable course toward his or her goal. If the character fails, he or she
still reaches the goal, but it takes the character twice as long (the
character loses time backtracking and correcting his or her path). If the
character fails by more than 5, the or she travels the expected time, but only
gets halfway to his or her destination, at which point the character becomes
lost.

A character may make a second Navigate
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) (DC 20) to regain his
or her path. If the character succeeds, he or she continues on to his or her
destination; the total time for the trip is twice the normal time. If the
character fails, he or she loses half a day before the character can try
again. The character keeps trying until he or she succeeds, losing half a day
for each failure.

When faced with multiple choices, such as at a branch in a tunnel, a character
can make a Navigate [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) (DC
20) to intuit the choice that takes the character toward a known destination.
If unsuccessful, the character chooses the wrong path, but at the next
juncture, with a successful
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill), the character realizes
his or her mistake.

A character cannot use this function of Navigate to find a path to a site if
the character has no idea where the site is located. The GM may choose to make
the Navigate [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) for the
character in secret, so he or she doesn’t know from the result whether the
character is following the right or wrong path.

A character can use Navigate to determine his or her position on earth without
the use of any high-tech equipment by checking the constellations or other
natural landmarks. The character must have a clear view of the night sky to
make this [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill). The DC is
15.

Special: A character can [take 10](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#take10) when making a Navigate
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill). A character can [take 20](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#take20) only when determining his
or her location, not when traveling.

A character with the [Guide](/modern.d20.srd/feats/guide) feat gets a +2 bonus
on all Navigate [checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill).

Time: A Navigate [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) is a
[full-round action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions).
