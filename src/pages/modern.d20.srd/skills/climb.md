[Check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics): With each successful
Climb [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics), the character
can advance up, down, or across a slope or a wall or other steep incline (or
even a ceiling with handholds).

A slope is considered to be any incline of less than 60 degrees; a wall is any
incline of 60 degrees or steeper. A failed Climb
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) indicates that the
character makes no progress, and a
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) that fails by 5 or more
means that the character falls from whatever height he or she had already
attained (unless the character is secured with some kind of harness or other
equipment).

The DC of the [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) depends
on the conditions of the climb. If the climb is less than 10 feet, reduce the
DC by 5.

Since the character can’t move to avoid an
[attack](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attack.roll), he or she is flat-footed while
climbing (the character loses any
[Dexterity](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) bonus to
[Defense](/modern.d20.srd/combat/defense)).

Any time the character takes [damage](/modern.d20.srd/combat/damage) while
climbing, make a Climb [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics)
against the DC of the slope or wall. Failure means the character falls from
his or her current height and sustains the appropriate [falling damage](/modern.d20.srd/environment.hazards/falling).

Accelerated Climbing: A character can try to climb more quickly than normal.
The character can move his or her full speed, but the character takes a –5
penalty on his or her Climb
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics). (Moving twice the
character’s speed in a round requires two
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics), one for each [move action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/move.actions).)

Making Handholds and Footholds: A character can make handholds and footholds
by pounding pitons into a wall. Doing so takes 1 minute per piton, and one
piton is needed per 3 feet. As with any surface with handholds and footholds,
a wall with pitons in it has a DC of 15. In similar fashion, a climber with an
ice axe or other proper implement can cut handholds or footholds in an ice
wall.

Catching Yourself When Falling: It’s practically impossible for a character to
catch him or herself on a wall while falling. Make a Climb
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) (DC equal to wall’s DC
+ 20) to do so. A slope is relatively easier to catch on (DC equal to slope’s
DC + 10).

Special: Someone using a rope can haul a character upward (or lower the
character) by means of sheer strength. Use two times a character’s [maximum load](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/carrying.capacity) to determine how much
weight he or she can lift.

A character can [take 10](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics)
while climbing, but can’t [take 20](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

A character without [climbing gear](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/survival.gear)
takes a –4 penalty on Climb
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics). At the GM’s
discretion, certain kinds of climbing attempts might require only a rope or
some other implement, or even just one’s hands and feet, rather than a full
set of [climbing gear](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/survival.gear) to avoid the
penalty.

A character with the [Athletic](/modern.d20.srd/feats/athletic) feat gets a +2
bonus on all Climb [checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

Time: Climbing at one-half your speed is a [full-round action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions). Moving half that far (one-
fourth the character’s speed) is a [move action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/move.actions).

Accelerated climbing, allowing the character to climb at his or her full
speed, is a [full-round action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions). A
character can move half that far (one-half his or her speed) as a [move action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/move.actions).
