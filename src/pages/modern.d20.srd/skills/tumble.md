## Tumble ([Dex](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores)) [Trained Only](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics); [Armor Penalty](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/armor.general)

[Check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics): A character can land
softly when he or she falls, tumble past opponents in combat, or tumble
through opponents.

Land Softly: The character can make a Tumble
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) (DC 15) when
[falling](/modern.d20.srd/environment.hazards/falling). If the check succeeds,
treat the fall as if it were 10 feet shorter when determining
[damage](/modern.d20.srd/environment.hazards/falling).

Tumble past Opponents: With a successful Tumble
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) (DC 15), the character
can weave, dodge, and roll up to 20 feet through squares adjacent to
opponents, risking no [attacks of opportunity](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attacks.of.opportunity). Failure means the
character moves as planned, but provokes [attacks of opportunity](/modern.d20.srd/combat/attacks.of.opportunity) as normal.

Tumble through Opponents: With a successful Tumble
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) (DC 25), the character
can roll, jump, or dive through squares occupied by opponents, moving over,
under, or around them as if they weren’t there. Failure means the character
moves as planned, but provokes [attacks of opportunity](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) as normal.

Try Again?: No.

Special: A character with 5 or more ranks in Tumble gains a +3 dodge bonus to
[Defense](/modern.d20.srd/combat/defense) (instead of the normal +2) when
fighting [defensively](/modern.d20.srd/combat/defense), and a +6 dodge bonus
(instead of the normal +4) when engaging in [total defense](/modern.d20.srd/combat/defense). A character can [take 10](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) when making a Tumble
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics), but can’t [take 20](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

A character with the [Acrobatic](/modern.d20.srd/feats/acrobatic) feat and at
least 1 rank in this skill gets a +2 bonus on all Tumble
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

Time: A character can try to reduce damage from a fall as a reaction once per
fall. A character can attempt to tumble as a [free action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/action.types) that must be performed as part of
a [move action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/move.actions).
