## Pilot ([Dex](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores)) [Trained Only](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics)

[Check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill): Typical piloting tasks
don’t require checks. [Checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill)
are required during combat, for [special maneuvers](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/simple.maneuvers), or
in other extreme circumstances, or when the pilot wants to attempt something
outside the normal parameters of the vehicle. When flying, the character can
attempt [simple maneuvers](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/simple.maneuvers) and
[stunts](/modern.d20.srd/vehicle.movement.and.combat/stunts) (actions in which
the pilot attempts to do something complex very quickly or in a limited
space).

Each [vehicle’s](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/equipment.vehicles) description
includes a maneuver modifier that applies to Pilot
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) made by the operator
of the vehicle.

Special: A character can [take 10](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#take10) when making a Pilot
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill), but can’t [take 20](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#take20).

A character with the [Vehicle Expert](/modern.d20.srd/feats/vehicle.expert)
feat gets a +2 bonus on all Pilot
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill).

There is no penalty for operating a general-purpose fixed-wing
[aircraft](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/civilian.aircraft). Other types of
aircraft (heavy aircraft, helicopters, jet fighters, and spacecraft) require
the corresponding [Aircraft Operation](/modern.d20.srd/feats/aircraft.operation) feat, or else the
character takes a –4 penalty on Pilot
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill).

Time: A Pilot [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) is a
[move action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/move.actions).
