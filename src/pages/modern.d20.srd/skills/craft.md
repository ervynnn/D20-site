This skill encompasses several categories, each of them treated as a separate
skill: [Craft (chemical)](/modern.d20.srd/skills/craft.chemical), [Craft (electronic)](/modern.d20.srd/skills/craft.electronic), [Craft (mechanical)](/modern.d20.srd/skills/craft.mechanical), [Craft (pharmaceutical)](/modern.d20.srd/skills/craft.pharmaceutical), [Craft (structural)](/modern.d20.srd/skills/craft.structural), [Craft (visual arts)](/modern.d20.srd/skills/craft.visual.art), and [Craft (writing)](/modern.d20.srd/skills/craft.writing).

Craft skills are specifically focused on creating objects. To use a Craft
skill effectively, a character must have a
[kit](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/professional.equipment) or some other set of
[basic tools](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/professional.equipment). The purchase
DC of this equipment varies according to the particular Craft skill.

To use Craft, first decide what the character is trying to make and consult
the category descriptions below. Make a [Wealth check](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.check) against the given purchase DC for
the object to see if the character succeeds in acquiring the raw materials. If
the character succeeds at that [check](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.check),
make the Craft [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) against
the given DC for the object in question. If the character fails the
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics), he or she does not
make the object, and the raw materials are wasted (unless otherwise noted).

Generally, a character can [take 10](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) when using a Craft skill
to construct an object, but canâ€™t [take 20](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) (since doing so represents
multiple attempts, and the character uses up the raw materials after the first
attempt). The exception is [Craft (writing)](/modern.d20.srd/skills/craft.writing); a character can [take 20](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) because the character does
not use up any raw materials (and thus no [Wealth check](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.check) is required to use the skill).
