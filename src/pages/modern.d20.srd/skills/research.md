##  Research ( [ Int ](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores) )

[ Check ](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) : Researching a topic
takes time, skill, and some luck. The GM determines how obscure a particular
topic is (the more obscure, the higher the DC) and what kind of information
might be available depending on where the character is conducting his or her
research.

Information ranges from general to protected. Given enough time (usually 1d4
hours) and a successful skill [ check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) , the character gets a
general idea about a given topic. This assumes that no obvious reasons exist
why such information would be unavailable, and that the character has a way to
acquire restricted or protected information.

The higher the [ check ](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics)
result, the better and more complete the information. If the character wants
to discover a specific fact, date, map, or similar bit of information, add +5
to +15 to the DC.

Try Again?: Yes.

Special: A character can [ take 10](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) or [ take 20](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) on a Research [ check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) .

A character with the [ Studious ](/modern.d20.srd/feats/studious) feat gets a
+2 bonus on all Research [ checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) .

[ Computer Use ](/modern.d20.srd/skills/computer.use) can provide a +2 [synergy bonus ](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) on a Research [check ](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) when searching computer
records for data (see [ Skill Synergy](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) ).

Time: A Research [ check ](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics)
takes 1d4 hours.
