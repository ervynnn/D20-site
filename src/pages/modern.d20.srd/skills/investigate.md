## Investigate ([Int](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores)) [Trained Only](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics)

[Check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics): A character generally
uses [Search](/modern.d20.srd/skills/search) to discover clues and Investigate
to analyze them. If the character has access to a crime lab, the character
uses the Investigate skill to collect and prepare samples for the lab. The
result of the Investigate
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) provides bonuses or
penalties to the lab workers.

Analyze Clue: The character can make an Investigate
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) to apply forensics
knowledge to a clue. This function of the Investigate skill does not give the
character clues where none existed before. It simply allows the character to
extract extra information from a clue he or she has found.

The base DC to analyze a clue is 15. It is modified by the time that has
elapsed since the clue was left, and whether or not the scene was disturbed.


<table> <tr> <th>Circumstances</th> <th>DC Modifier</th> </tr> <tr><td> Every day since event (max modifier +10)</td><td> +2 </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> Scene is outdoors</td><td> +5 </td></tr> <tr><td> Scene slightly disturbed</td><td> +2 </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> Scene moderately disturbed</td><td> +4 </td></tr> <tr><td> Scene extremely disturbed</td><td> +6 </td></tr> </table>



Collect Evidence: The character can collect and prepare evidentiary material
for a lab. This use of the Investigate skill requires an [evidence kit](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/professional.equipment).

To collect a piece of evidence, make an Investigate
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) (DC 15). If the
character succeeds, the evidence is usable by a crime lab. If the character
fails, a crime lab analysis can be done, but the lab takes a –5 penalty on any
necessary [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics). If the
character fails by 5 or more, the lab analysis simply cannot be done. On the
other hand, if the character succeeds by 10 or more, the lab gains a +2
circumstance bonus on its
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) to analyze the
material.

This function of the Investigate skill does not provide the character with
evidentiary items. It simply allows the character to collect items he or she
has found in a manner that best aids in their analysis later, at a crime lab.

Try Again?: Generally, analyzing a clue again doesn’t add new insight unless
another clue is introduced. Evidence collected cannot be recollected, unless
there is more of it to take.

Special: A character can [take 10](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) when making an Investigate
check, but cannot [take 20](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

Collecting evidence requires an [evidence kit](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/professional.equipment). If the character does
not have the appropriate kit, the character takes a –4 penalty on his or her
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

A character with the [Attentive](/modern.d20.srd/feats/attentive) feat and at
least 1 rank in this skill gets a +2 bonus on all Investigate
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

Time: Analyzing a clue is a [full-round action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions). Collecting evidence
generally takes 1d4 minutes per object.
