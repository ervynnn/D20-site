## Craft (Writing) ([Int](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores))

This skill allows a character to create short stories, novels, scripts and
screenplays, newspaper articles and columns, and similar works of writing.

When creating a work of writing, the player simply makes a Craft (writing)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill), the result of which
determines the quality of the work.

No [Wealth check](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.check) is necessary to use
this Craft skill.


<table> <tr><th> Skill Check Result</th><th> Effort Achieved </th></tr> <tr><td> 9 or lower</td><td> Untalented amateur </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> 10–19</td><td> Talented amateur </td></tr> <tr><td> 20–24</td><td> Professional </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> 25–30</td><td> Expert </td></tr> <tr><td> 31 or higher</td><td> Master </td></tr> </table>


Creating a work of writing requires at least 1 hour, but usually takes a day,
a week, or more, depending on the scope of the project.

Special: A character with the [Creative](/modern.d20.srd/feats/creative) feat
gets a +2 bonus on all Craft (writing)
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill).
