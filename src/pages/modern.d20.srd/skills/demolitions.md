[Check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics): Setting a simple
explosive to blow up at a certain spot doesn’t require a
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics), but connecting and
setting a detonator does. Also, placing an explosive for maximum effect
against a structure calls for a
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics), as does disarming an
explosive device.

Set Detonator: Most explosives require a detonator to go off. Connecting a
detonator to an explosive requires a Demolitions
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) (DC 10). Failure means
that the explosive fails to go off as planned. Failure by 10 or more means the
explosive goes off as the detonator is being installed.

A character can make an explosive difficult to disarm. To do so, the character
chooses the disarm DC before making his or her
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) to set the detonator
(it must be higher than 10). The character’s DC to set the detonator is equal
to the disarm DC.

Place Explosive Device: Carefully placing an explosive against a fixed
structure (a stationary, unattended inanimate object) can maximize the damage
dealt by exploiting vulnerabilities in the structure’s construction.

The GM makes the [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) (so
that the character doesn’t know exactly how well he or she has done). On a
result of 15 or higher, the explosive deals double damage to the structure
against which it is placed. On a result of 25 or higher, it deals triple
damage to the structure. In all cases, it deals normal damage to all other
targets within its burst radius.

Disarm Explosive Device: Disarming an explosive that has been set to go off
requires a Demolitions [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).
The DC is usually 10, unless the person who set the detonator chose a higher
disarm DC. If the character fails the
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics), he or she does not
disarm the explosive. If the character fails by more than 5, the explosive
goes off.

Special: A character can [take 10](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) when using the Demolitions
skill, but can’t [take 20](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

A character with the [Cautious](/modern.d20.srd/feats/cautious) feat and at
least 1 rank in this skill gets a +2 bonus on all Demolitions
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

A character without a [demolitions kit](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/professional.equipment) takes a –4 penalty on
Demolitions [checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

Making an explosive requires the [Craft (chemical)](/modern.d20.srd/skills/craft.chemical) skill. See that skill
description for details.

Time: Setting a detonator is usually a [full-round action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions). Placing an explosive
device takes 1 minute or more, depending on the scope of the job.
