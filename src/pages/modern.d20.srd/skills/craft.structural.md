## Craft (Structural) ([Int](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores))

This skill allows a character to build wooden, concrete, or metal structures
from scratch, including bookcases, desks, walls, houses, and so forth, and
includes such handyman skills as plumbing, house painting, drywall, laying
cement, and building cabinets.


<table> <tr><th>Type of Scratch-Built Structure (Examples)</th> <th>Purchase DC</th> <th>Craft DC</th> <th>Time</th></tr> <tr><td> Simple (bookcase, false wall)</td><td> 5</td><td> 15</td><td> 12 hr. </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> Moderate (catapult, shed, house deck)</td><td> 10</td><td> 20</td><td> 24 hr. </td></tr> <tr><td> Complex (bunker, domed ceiling)</td><td> 15</td><td> 25</td><td> 60 hr. </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> Advanced (house)</td><td> 20</td><td> 30</td><td> 600 hr. </td></tr> </table>


When building a structure from scratch, the character describes the kind of
structure he or she wants to construct; then the Gamemaster decides if the
structure is simple, moderate, complex, or advanced in scope and difficulty.

Special: A character without a [mechanical tool kit](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/professional.equipment) takes a â€“4 penalty on
