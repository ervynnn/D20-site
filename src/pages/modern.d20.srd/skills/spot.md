## Spot ([Wis](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores))

[Check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill): The Spot skill is used
to notice items that aren’t immediately obvious and people who are attempting
to hide. The GM may call for a Spot
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) by a character who is
in a position to notice something. A character can also make a Spot
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) voluntarily if he or
she wants to try to notice something in his or her vicinity.

The GM may make the Spot
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) in secret so that the
character doesn’t know whether not noticing anything means that nothing is
there or that the character failed the
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill).

A successful Spot [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) when
there isn’t anything to notice results in the character noticing nothing.

Spot is often used to notice a person or creature hiding from view. In such
cases, the character’s Spot
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) is opposed by the
[Hide](/modern.d20.srd/skills/hide)
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) of the character trying
not to be seen. Spot is also used to detect someone in disguise (see the
[Disguise](/modern.d20.srd/skills/disguise) skill), or to notice a concealed
weapon on another person.

A character’s Spot [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) is
modified by a –1 penalty for every 10 feet of distance between the character
and the character or object he or she is trying to discern. The
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) carries a further –5
penalty if the character is in the midst of activity.

Try Again?: A character can make a Spot
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) every time he or she
has the opportunity to notice something in a reactive manner. As a [full-round action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions), a character may attempt to
notice something that he or she failed (or believe he or she failed) to notice
previously.

Special: A character can [take 10](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#take10) or [take 20](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#take20) when making a Spot
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill).

A character with the [Alertness](/modern.d20.srd/feats/alertness) feat gets a
+2 bonus on all Spot [checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill).

Time: A Spot [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) is either
a reaction (if called for by the GM) or a [full-round action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions) (if a character actively
takes the time to try to notice something).
