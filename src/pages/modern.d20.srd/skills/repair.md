[Check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics): Most Repair
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) are made to fix
complex electronic or mechanical devices. The DC is set by the GM. In general,
simple repairs have a DC of 10 to 15 and require no more than a few minutes to
accomplish. More complex repair work has a DC of 20 or higher and can require
an hour or more to complete. Making repairs also involves a monetary cost when
spare parts or new components are needed, represented by a [Wealth check](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.check). If the GM decides this isn’t
necessary for the type of repair the character is attempting, then no [Wealth check](/modern.d20.srd/wealth/wealth.check) is needed.

Jury-Rig: A character can choose to attempt jury-rigged, or temporary,
repairs. Doing this reduces the purchase DC by 3 and the Repair
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) DC by 5, and allows the
character to make the checks in as little as a [full- round](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions) action. However, a jury-
rigged repair can only fix a single problem with a
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics), and the temporary
repair only lasts until the end of the current scene or encounter. The jury-
rigged object must be fully repaired thereafter.

A character can also use jury-rig to hot-wire a car or jump-start an engine or
electronic device. The DC for this is at least 15, and it can be higher
depending on the presence of security devices.

The jury-rig application of the Repair skill can be used untrained.

Try Again?: Yes, though in some specific cases, the GM may decide that a
failed Repair [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) has
negative ramifications that prevent repeated
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

Special: A character can [take 10](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) or [take 20](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) on a Repair
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics). When making a Repair
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) to accomplish a jury-
rig repair, a character can’t [take 20](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

Repair requires an [electrical tool kit](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/professional.equipment), a [mechanical tool kit](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/professional.equipment), or a [multipurpose tool](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/professional.equipment), depending on the
task. If the character do not have the appropriate tools, he or she takes a –4
penalty on the [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

[Craft (mechanical)](/modern.d20.srd/skills/craft.mechanical) or [Craft (electronic)](/modern.d20.srd/skills/craft.electronic) can provide a +2
[synergy bonus](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) on Repair
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) made for mechanical or
electronic devices (see [Skill Synergy](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics)).

A character with the [Gearhead](/modern.d20.srd/feats/gearhead) feat and at
least 1 rank in this skill gets a +2 bonus on all Repair
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

Time: See the table for guidelines. A character can make a jury-rig repair as
a [full-round action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions), but the work
only lasts until the end of the current encounter.
