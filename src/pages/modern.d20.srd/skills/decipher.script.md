## Decipher Script ([Int](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores)) [Trained Only](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics)

[Check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics): A character can
decipher writing in an ancient language or in code, or interpret the meaning
of an incomplete text. The base DC is 20 for the simplest messages, 25 for
standard codes, and 30 or higher for intricate or complex codes or exotic
messages. Helpful texts or computer programs can provide a bonus (usually a +2
circumstance bonus) on the
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics), provided they are
applicable to the script in question.

If the [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) succeeds, the
character understands the general content of a piece of writing, reading about
one page of text or its equivalent in 1 minute. If the check fails, the GM
makes a [Wisdom check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) (DC 10) for the
character to see if he or she avoids drawing a false conclusion about the
text. (Success means that the character does not draw a false conclusion;
failure means that the character does.)

The GM secretly makes both the skill
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) and the [Wisdom check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) so the character can’t tell
whether the conclusion drawn is accurate or not.

Try Again?: No, unless conditions change or new information is uncovered.

Special: A character can [take 10](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) when making a Decipher
Script [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics), but can’t [take 20](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

A character with the [Studious](/modern.d20.srd/feats/studious) feat gets a +2
bonus on all Decipher Script
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

Time: Decipher Script takes 1 minute or more, depending on the complexity of
the code.
