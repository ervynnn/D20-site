## Knowledge ([Int](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores)) [Trained Only](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill)

This skill encompasses several categories, each of them treated as a separate
skill. These categories are identified and defined below.

The number of Knowledge categories is kept purposely finite. When trying to
determine what Knowledge skill a particular question or field of expertise
falls under, use a broad interpretation of the existing categories. Do not
arbitrarily make up new categories.

[Check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill): A character makes a
Knowledge [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) to see if the
character knows something.

The DC for answering a question within the character’s field of study is 10
for easy questions, 15 for basic questions, and 20 to 30 for tough questions.

Appraising the value of an object is one sort of task that can be performed
using Knowledge. The DC depends on how common or obscure the object is. On a
success, the character accurately identifies the object’s purchase DC. If the
character fails, he or she thinks it has a purchase DC 1d2 higher or lower
(determine randomly) than its actual value. If the character fails by 5 or
more, he or she thinks it has a purchase DC 1d4+2 higher or lower than its
actual value. The GM may make the Knowledge roll for the character, so he or
she doesn’t know whether the appraisal is accurate or not.

The fourteen Knowledge categories, and the topics each one encompasses, are as
follows.

Arcane Lore: The occult, magic and the supernatural, astrology, numerology,
and similar topics.

Art: Fine arts and graphic arts, including art history and artistic
techniques. Antiques, modern art, photography, and performance art forms such
as music and dance, among others.

Behavioral Sciences: Psychology, sociology, and criminology.

Business: Business procedures, investment strategies, and corporate
structures. Bureaucratic procedures and how to navigate them.

Civics: Law, legislation, litigation, and legal rights and obligations.
Political and governmental institutions and processes.

Current Events: Recent happenings in the news, sports, politics,
entertainment, and foreign affairs. Earth and Life Sciences: Biology, botany,
genetics, geology, and paleontology. Medicine and forensics. History: Events,
personalities, and cultures of the past. Archaeology and antiquities.

Physical Sciences: Astronomy, chemistry, mathematics, physics, and
engineering.

Popular Culture: Popular music and personalities, genre films and books, urban
legends, comics, science fiction, and gaming, among others.

Streetwise: Street and urban culture, local underworld personalities and
events.

Tactics: Techniques and strategies for disposing and maneuvering forces in
combat.

Technology: Current developments in cutting-edge devices, as well as the
background necessary to identify various technological devices.

Theology and Philosophy: Liberal arts, ethics, philosophical concepts, and the
study of religious faith, practice, and experience.

Try Again?: No. The [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill)
represents what a character knows, and thinking about a topic a second time
doesn’t let the character know something he or she never knew in the first
place.

Special: An untrained Knowledge
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) is simply an
[Intelligence check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics). Without actual
training, a character only knows common knowledge about a given subject.

A character can [take 10](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#take10) when
making a Knowledge [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill), but
can’t take 20.

A character with the [Educated](/modern.d20.srd/feats/educated) feat gets a +2
bonus on any two types of Knowledge
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill).

The GM may decide that having 5 or more ranks in a specific Knowledge skill
provides a character with a +2 [synergy bonus](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) when making a related
[skill check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill).

Time: A Knowledge [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics.php#skill) can
be a reaction, but otherwise requires a [full-round action](/modern.d20.srd/combat/full.round.actions).
