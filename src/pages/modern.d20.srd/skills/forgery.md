## Forgery ([Int](/modern.d20.srd/basics/ability.scores))

[Check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics): Forgery requires
materials appropriate to the document being forged, and some time. To forge a
document the character needs to have seen a similar document before. The
complexity of the document, the character’s degree of familiarity with it, and
whether the character needs to reproduce the signature or handwriting of a
specific individual, provide modifiers to the Forgery
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics), as shown below.


<table> <tr><th colspan="3"> Document Type</th></tr> <tr> <th>Factor</th> <th>Check Modifier</th> <th>Time</th> </tr> <tr><td> Simple (typed letter, business card)</td><td> +0</td><td> 10 min. </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> Moderate (letterhead, business form)</td><td> –2</td><td> 20 min. </td></tr> <tr><td> Complex (stock certificate, driver’s license)</td><td> –4</td><td> 1 hr. </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> Difficult (passport)</td><td> –8</td><td> 4 hr. </td></tr> <tr><td> Extreme (military/law enforcement ID)</td><td> –16</td><td> 24 hr. </td></tr></table>

 
<table> <tr><th colspan="2"> Familiarity</th></tr> <tr> <th>Factor</th> <th>Check Modifier</th> </tr> <tr><td> Unfamiliar (seen once for less than a minute)</td><td> –4 </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> Fairly familiar (seen for several minutes)</td><td> +0 </td></tr> <tr><td> Quite familiar (on hand, or studied at leisure)</td><td> +4 </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> Forger has produced other documents of same type</td><td> +4 </td></tr> <tr><td> Document includes specific signature</td><td> –4 </td></tr> </table>



Some documents require security or authorization codes, whether authentic ones
or additional forgeries. The GM makes the character’s
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) secretly so the
character is not sure how good his or her forgery is.

The Forgery skill is also used to detect someone else’s forgery. The result of
the original Forgery [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics)
that created the document is opposed by a Forgery
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) by the person who
examines the document to
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) its authenticity. If
the examiner’s [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) result
is equal to or higher than the original Forgery
[check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics), the document is
determined to be fraudulent. The examiner gains bonuses or penalties on his or
her [check](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) as given in the
table below.


<table> <tr><th> Condition</th><th> Examiner’s Check Modifier</th></tr> <tr><td> Type of document unknown to examiner</td><td> –4 </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> Type of document somewhat known to examiner</td><td> –2 </td></tr> <tr><td> Type of document well known to examiner</td><td> +0 </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> Document is put through additional tests<sup>1</sup></td><td> +4 </td></tr> <tr><td> Examiner only casually reviews the document<sup>1</sup></td><td> –2 </td></tr> <tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align: left; font-size: .8em;"> <sup>1</sup>Cumulative with any of the first three conditions on the table. Apply this modifier along with one of the other three whenever appropriate. </td></tr></table>



A document that contradicts procedure, orders, or previous knowledge, or one
that requires the examiner to relinquish a possession or a piece of
information, can increase the examiner’s suspicion (and thus create favorable
circumstances for the examiner’s opposed Forgery check).

Try Again?: No, since the forger isn’t sure of the quality of the original
forgery.

Special: To forge documents and detect forgeries, one must be able to [read and write](/modern.d20.srd/skills/read.write.language) the language in
question. (The skill is language-dependent.)

A character can [take 10](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics) when
making a Forgery check, but can’t [take 20](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

A character with the [Meticulous](/modern.d20.srd/feats/meticulous) feat gets
a +2 bonus on all Forgery
[checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

A character without a [forgery kit](/modern.d20.srd/equipment/professional.equipment) takes a –4 penalty on
Forgery [checks](/modern.d20.srd/skills/skill.basics).

Time: Forging a short, simple document takes about 1 minute. Longer or more
complex documents take 1d4 minutes per page or longer.
