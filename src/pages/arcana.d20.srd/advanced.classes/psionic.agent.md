### Class Features

The following features pertain to the Psionic Agent advanced class.

**Psionic Skills**

At 1st level, the Psionic Agent gains access to the Autohypnosis and
Concentration skills, as described for the Battle Mind.

**Psionic Powers**

The Psionic Agent’s key talent is the ability to manifest psionics powers
related to movement and detection.

A psionic power is a one-time psionic effect. Psionic powers require power
points to use. Unlike arcane spellcasters, psionicists don’t have spellbooks
and they don’t prepare powers ahead of time. A psionicist’s level limits the
number of power points available for manifesting powers. In addition, a
psionicist must have a key ability score equal to at least 10 + the power’s
level to manifest a particular power. The Psionic Agent’s selection of psionic
powers is extremely limited and tied both to detection and avoiding being
detected. The Psionic Agent knows two 0-level powers (called talents) of your
choice. At each level, the Psionic Agent discovers one or more previously
latent powers, as indicated on the table below.

The DC for saving throws to resist a psionic power is 10 + the power’s level +
the Psionic Agent’s key ability modifier.

A Psionic Agent can manifest a certain number of powers per day based on her
available power points. (0-level powers have a special cost.) She just pays
the power point cost of a power to manifest it, no preparation necessary. The
base number of power points available per day is shown above.

**Psionic Focus**

At 2nd level, a Psionic Agent chooses two powers that share the same primary
ability score, and adds +2 to the DC for all saving throws against those
powers.

**Bonus Feats**

At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Psionic Agent gets a bonus feat. The bonus
feat must be selected from the following list, and the Psionic Agent must meet
all of the prerequisites for the feat to select it.

Athletic, Blind-Fight, Cleave, Combat Reflexes, Double Tap, Exotic Melee
Weapons Proficiency, Focused, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Shot on the Run,
Skip Shot, Weapon Focus, as well as any metapsionic feats.

**Draw Power**

At 4th level, a Psionic Agent can spend an action point to regain a number of
power points equal to her levels in this class. This is an attack action.

**Charged Shot**

At 5th level, a Psionic Agent may do additional damage with a ranged attack.
Before making any single ranged attack, the Psionic Agent, as a free action,
spends a power point to “charge” a weapon. The next attack deals an extra 1d4
points of damage if it hits (if it misses, it deals no damage, and the power
point is still spent). The Psionic Agent may spend multiple free actions and
power points in a single round if she has multiple attacks, but may only
“charge” each attack once. A shot remains “charged” for a number of rounds
equal to her levels in this class.

**Combat Manifestation**

At 7th level, a Psionic Agent becomes adept at manifesting psionic powers in
combat. She gets a +4 bonus on Concentration checks to manifest a power while
on the defensive.

**Power Penetration**

At 8th level, the Psionic Agent’s powers are more potent at breaking through
power resistance (and spell resistance) of opponents. The Psionic Agent gains
a +2 on manifester level checks to beat a creature’s power resistance. For
those campaigns where spell resistance and power resistance are equal, it
applies to spell resistance as well.

**Deadly Aim**

At 10th level, the Psionic Agent is capable of using her abilities to strike
at the chinks in the defense of opponent with a ranged weapon. At 10th level,
the Psionic Agent may pay 5 power points to turn a ranged attack into a ranged
touch attack.
