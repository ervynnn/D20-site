##  Melee Weapons

Melee weapons are used in close combat and are generally among the simplest
weapons to use. The feat that provides proficiency with these weapons varies
from weapon to weapon; some are considered simple weapons (covered by the
Simple Weapon Proficiency feat); others are archaic (covered by the Archaic
Weapons Proficiency feat) or exotic (covered by the Exotic Melee Weapons
feat).

 **Axe, Orc Double**

An orc double axe is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting
with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties
associated with fighting with two weapons, as if you were wielding a one-
handed weapon and a light weapon A creature using a double weapon in one hand,
such as an ogre using an orc double axe, can’t use it as a double weapon.

**Battleaxe**

The battleaxe has a large metal head and is popular with cultists and others
who like to leave big, bloody wounds.

**Club, Spiked**

Also called a morningstar, this simple weapon combines the impact of a club
with the piercing force of spikes.

**Cutlass**

The cutlass is a short, heavy, slightly curved blade useful for both stabbing
and slashing. Its heavy basket hilt gives the wielder a +2 equipment bonus on
any checks to resist being disarmed.

**Dagger, Punching**

Also called a katar, the punching dagger puts the full force of the wielder’s
punch behind it, making it capable of deadly strikes.

**Falchion**

This sword, which is essentially a two-handed scimitar, has a curve that gives
it a keener edge.

**Flail, Dire**

A dire flail is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two
weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated
with fighting with two weapons, as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a
light weapon. A creature using a double weapon in one hand can’t use it as a
double weapon.

With a dire flail, you gain a +2 bonus on your opposed attack roll when
attempting to disarm an enemy (including the opposed attack roll to avoid
being disarmed if you fail to disarm your enemy).

You can also use this weapon to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during
your own trip attempt, you can drop the dire flail to avoid being tripped.

**Flail, Light and Heavy**

With a flail, you gain a +2 bonus on your opposed attack roll when attempting
to disarm an enemy (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if you fail to
disarm your enemy). You can also use this weapon to make trip attacks. If you
are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the flail to avoid
being tripped.

**Gauntlet**

These metal gloves protect your hands and let you deal lethal damage with
unarmed strikes rather than nonlethal damage. A strike with a gauntlet is
otherwise considered an unarmed attack. The cost and weight given are for a
single gauntlet. Medium and heavy archaic armors (except breastplates) come
with gauntlets.

**Gauntlet, Spiked**

Your opponent cannot use a disarm action to disarm you of spiked gauntlets.
The cost and weight given are for a single gauntlet. An attack with a spiked
gauntlet is considered an armed attack that deals lethal damage.

**Glaive**

A glaive has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you
can’t use it against an adjacent foe.

**Greataxe**

This big, heavy axe is a favorite of large Shadow creatures or anybody else
who wants the capability to deal out incredible damage.

**Greatclub**

A greatclub is a two-handed version of a regular club.

**Greatsword**

This huge sword, including the Scottish claymore, can deal tremendous damage
in the right hands.

**Guisarme**

A guisarme has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you
can’t use it against adjacent foes. Because of the guisarme’s curved blade,
you can also use it to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own
trip attack, you can drop the guisarme to avoid being tripped.

**Halberd**

Halberds are extremely rare outside of ceremonial functions or museums,
although some Shadow creatures wield them. Normally, you strike with the
halberd’s axe head, but the spike on the end is useful against charging
opponents. Because of the hook on the back of the halberd, you can use it to
make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can
drop the halberd to avoid being tripped.

**Hammer, Gnome Hooked**

A gnome hooked hammer is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting
with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties
associated with fighting with two weapons, as if you were using a one-handed
weapon and a light weapon. A creature using a double weapon in one hand, such
as a human using a gnome hooked hammer, can’t use it as a double weapon. The
hammer’s blunt head is a bludgeoning weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage
(x3 crit). Its hook is a piercing weapon that deals 1d4 points of damage (x4
crit). You can use either head as the primary weapon head. The other head is
the off-hand weapon.

**Ketch-All Pole**

A ketch-all pole is designed to capture opponents with a minimum of harm. A
wielder who hits an opponent with a ketchall pole can immediately initiate a
grapple (as a free action) without provoking an attack of opportunity. In
addition to the normal options available to a grappler, the wielder of a
ketchall pole can attempt to pull his target to the ground (the equivalent of
a trip attack, though no attack roll is necessary).

The ketch-all pole has reach and cannot be used against adjacent opponents. A
ketch-all pole can only be used against opponents within one size category of
the wielder.

**Khopesh**

This bizarre sword is popular with cultists of Egyptian gods. The khopesh
looks like a normal longsword whose blade suddenly turns sickle-shaped about a
foot from the hilt. It is heavy and awkward to use without a lot of training.
You can use the khopesh to make trip attacks due to its hooklike blade.

**Lance, Heavy and Light**

A lance deals double damage when used from the back of a charging mount or
vehicle (like a motorcycle or bicycle). A heavy lance has reach. You can
strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can’t use it against an
adjacent foe. Light lances are primarily for Small riders.

**Maul**

Bigger than a sledgehammer, the maul is a two-handed warhammer of enormous
size. Ogres and other brutes favor it.

**Naginata**

A naginata is a finely crafted Japanese polearm. A naginata has reach. You can
strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can’t use it against an
adjacent foe.

**Nekode**

A nekode is a strap or glove fitted with spikes in the palm, favored as both a
weapon and a climbing tool by ninja. Your opponent cannot use a disarm action
to disarm you of a nekode. An attack with a nekode is considered an armed
attack. Using a pair of nekodes while climbing gives a +1 equipment bonus on
Climb checks. This bonus does not stack with the +2 bonus provided by a
climber’s kit. The bagh nakh (“tiger’s claws”) is similar to the nekode, but
wielded more like brass knuckles. Its statistics are the same, but it does not
give a bonus on Climb checks.

**Ninja-to**

The ninja-to—a short, straight sword similar to a wakizashi —is the standard
sword of the ninja. True to a ninja’s methods, the scabbard of the ninja-to is
a multipurpose tool. It is open at both ends, allowing it to be used as a
blowpipe for powders or poisons or as a breathing tube. It is also stiff and
strong, allowing it to be used as the rung of a ladder or even as a weapon
(use the statistics for a club).

**Pick**

A pick is designed to concentrate its force on a small, penetrating point. It
is a small, one-handed instrument that includes rock cutting picks and picks
designed for combat.

**Pickaxe**

This is a heavy, two-handed tool commonly used for mining and digging dirt.
The version listed here is strengthened for martial use. Quarterstaff

You can strike with either end of a quarterstaff, allowing you to take full
advantage of openings in your opponent’s defenses. A quarterstaff is a double
weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do,
you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two
weapons as if you are using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. A creature
using a double weapon in one hand, such as a Large creature using a
quarterstaff, can’t use it as a double weapon.

**Ranseur**

This curious-looking polearm has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away
with it, but you can’t use it against an adjacent foe. With a ranseur, you get
a +2 bonus on your opposed attack rolls when attempting to disarm an opponent
(including the roll to avoid being disarmed if you fail to disarm your
opponent).

**Saber**

The saber is a long, heavy sword specialized for use in mounted combat. You
gain a +1 equipment bonus on your attack rolls when you use a saber while
mounted (horse or a vehicle such as a motorcycle).

**Scourge**

A scourge is a multitailed, barbed whip. The scourge is often dipped in a
poison delivered via injury. With a scourge, you get a +2 bonus on your
opposed attack roll when attempting to disarm an enemy (including the roll to
avoid being disarmed if you fail to disarm your foe). You can also use this
weapon to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt,
you can drop the scourge to avoid being tripped.

**Scimitar**

A curved sword. The curve on this blade makes the weapon’s edge effectively
sharper.

**Scythe**

The scythe can be a powerful weapon in the right hands. The design of the
scythe focuses tremendous force on the sharp point as well as allowing
devastating slashes with the blade edge.

**Sickle**

This weapon is like a farmer’s sickle, but it is strengthened for use as a
weapon.

**Shikomi-zue**

This ninja weapon appears to be a stout bamboo or wooden staff, but a quick
twist or press of a button causes a spearhead to spring from one end. Without
the blade, the shikomizue deals the same damage as a quarterstaff (1d6, x2
crit), and can be used as a double weapon. With the blade out, it has the
statistics shown on Table: Melee Weapons.

**Shortspear**

A smaller spear that can be thrown.

**Sword, Bastard**

A bastard sword is too large to use in one hand without special training, thus
it is an exotic weapon. A Medium character can use a bastard sword two-handed
as a martial weapon, or a Large creature can use it one-handed in the same
way.

**Sword, Short**

This sword is popular with heroes for its concealability.

**Sword, Two-Bladed**

A two-bladed sword is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting
with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties
associated with fighting with two weapons as if you were using a one-handed
weapon and a light. A creature using a double weapon in one hand can’t use it
as a double weapon.

**Trident**

This three-tined piercing weapon can be thrown just as a shortspear can be,
but its range increment is shorter because it’s not as aerodynamic. Scuba
divers and aquatic Shadow creatures make use of tridents.

**rgosh, Dwarven**

A dwarven urgrosh is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting
with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties
associated with fighting with two weapons as if you were using a one-handed
weapon and a light. A creature using a double weapon in one hand can’t use it
as a double weapon.

The urgrosh’s axe head is a slashing weapon that deals 1d8 points of damage.
Its spear head is a piercing weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage. You can
use either head as the primary weapon head. The other is the off-hand weapon.
If you use an urgrosh against a charging character, the spear head is the part
of the weapon that does damage. An urgrosh is also called a spear-axe.

**Wakizashi**

The wakizashi is a Japanese masterwork short sword, granting a +1 bonus on
your attack rolls. A masterwork weapon’s bonus to attack does not stack with
an enhancement bonus to attack.

A samurai’s wakizashi is part of a matched pair with his katana, and—like the
katana—is an important part of his honor. Its most prominent use is in the
suicide ritual called seppuku.

**Waraxe, Dwarven**

A dwarven waraxe is too large to use in one hand without special training;
thus, it is an exotic weapon. A Medium character can use a dwarven waraxe two-
handed as a martial weapon, or a Large creature can use it one-handed in the
same way.

**Warhammer**

This is a one-handed sledge with a large, heavy head. It includes large work
hammers such as those that can be found around construction sites.

**War Fan**

This weapon appears to the untrained eye as nothing more than a beautifully
crafted fan. In fact, the vanes of the fan are crafted from steel, and the
tips are needle-sharp. When first brought into melee, the wielder may attempt
a Bluff check against an opponent’s Sense Motive check. If the wielder wins
the contest, he adds a +4 bonus to the attack roll for his first round’s
attack(s).
