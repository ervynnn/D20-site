You call a weapon "from thin air" into your waiting hand (actually, it is a
real weapon hailing from some other random location) as a free action. You
don't have to see or know of a weapon to call it-in fact, you can't ever call
a specific weapon. You just specify the type. If the specified weapon type is
one you can call at your level, it appears. If you call a projectile weapon,
it comes loaded with a clip, box, or chamber of ammunition, as appropriate
(the ammunition does not have an enhancement bonus, even at 10th level and
above). If you relinquish your grip on the weapon you called for 2 or more
rounds, it automatically returns to wherever it originally came from.

As your level increases, you can summon better weapons, although the power
point cost is also greater.

Weapons gained by call weaponry are distinctive due to the low hum they emit.
