##  Instant Reload

Dexterity

Level: Psionic Agent 3; Display: Audible, Material; Manifestation Time: Attack
action; Range: Touch; Target: One ranged weapon with ammunition; Duration: 1
hour/level; Saving Throw: None; Power Resistance: No; Power Points: 5

You can reload your weapon as an attack action, calling the ammunition from
another location in the same manner as call weaponry. The ammunition and its
location must be designated at the time the spell is case, but it may be any
distance away. Any amount may designated, but only one type of ammunition (as
far as caliber is concerned) may be used per manifestation. When activated,
the power automatically reloads the clip, chamber, or action of the weapon
with the full number of shots that it can hold.
