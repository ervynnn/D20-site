###  Species Traits

Breathsnatchers have the following traits:

Clawing Smoke (Su): Once every 1d4 rounds, a breathsnatcher can expel a
30-foot cone of magic smoke. The smoke grants one-half concealment to
creatures in its periphery and full concealment to characters obscured by more
than 5 feet of smoke. In addition, any creature within the cone must succeed
at a Fortitude save (DC 14) or get smoke in their lungs.

Holding one’s breath doesn’t help, as tendrils of smoke actively try to invade
the lungs. This magic smoke begins to rip at the lungs and surrounding organs,
dealing 3d4 points of damage per round. The affected creature can attempt
another Fortitude save each subsequent round to cough out the semivaporous
menace.

Snatch Breath (Su): As a full-round action, the breathsnatcher can steal the
breath from any adjacent creature with –1 or fewer hit points. This instantly
kills the creature and grants the breathsnatcher damage reduction 15/+1 for 1
hour per Hit Die of the victim.

Fast Healing 5 (Ex): A breathsnatcher heals 5 points of damage each round so
long as it has at least 1 hit point remaining.
