All dragons speak their own language, Draconic. They speak a number of
additional languages equal to their Intelligence bonus.

###  Species Traits

Dragons have the following traits:

Age Categories: Dragons have twelve age categories that broadly define most of
their statistics, including size, Hit Dice, Defense, attacks, and special
abilities. As a dragon ages, it grows more powerful, as defined in Table:
Dragon Age Categories.

Breath Weapon (Su): Using a breath weapon is a standard action. Once a dragon
breathes, it can’t breathe again until 1d4 rounds later. A blast from a breath
weapon always starts at the dragon’s mouth and extends in a direction of the
dragon’s choice, with an area as noted in Table: Dragon Breath Weapon Range.
If the breath weapon deals damage, creatures caught in the area can attempt
Reflex saves to take half damage; the DC depends on the dragon’s age. Saves
against nondamaging breath weapons use the same DC, but aren’t necessarily
Reflex saves.

Breath weapons are either cones (which are as high and wide as they are long)
or lines (5 feet high and 5 feet wide).

Each dragon has one breath weapon, which is associated with the color of its
scales and its allegiance to good or evil.

Fear Aura (Ex): A young adult or older dragon can unsettle foes with its mere
presence. The ability takes effect automatically whenever the dragon attacks
or flies overhead. Creatures within a radius of 30 feet x the dragon’s age
category are subject to the effect if they have fewer Hit Dice than the
dragon. A potentially affected creature that succeeds at a Will save (DC noted
in Table: Dragon Age Categories) remains immune to that dragon’s fear aura for
one day. On a failure, creatures with 4 or fewer HD become panicked for 4d6
rounds and those with 5 or more HD become shaken for 4d6 rounds. Dragons
ignore the fear aura of other dragons.

Crush (Ex): A flying or jumping dragon of at least Huge size can land on
opponents as an attack action, using its whole body to crush them. Crush
attacks are effective only against opponents three or more sizes smaller than
the dragon (though it can attempt normal overrun or grapple attacks against
larger opponents).

A crush attack affects as many cratures as can fit under the dragon’s body.
Creatures in the affected area must succeed at a Reflex save (DC noted in
Table: Dragon Age Categories) or be pinned and automatically take the listed
damage during the next round unless the dragon moves off them. If the dragon
chooses to maintain the pin, treat it as a normal grapple attack. Pinned
opponents take crush damage each round if they don’t escape.

Grappling: A dragon can always use its breath weapon while grappling, as well
as its spells and spell-like or supernatural abilities, provided it succeeds
at Concentration checks.

If grappled by a creature the same size or larger, a dragon can attack the
grappling creature with its bite and all four limbs (each doing claw damage).
If crushed by a larger dragon, a dragon can respond only with grapple attacks,
or with bite or breath weapon attacks. If grappled by a creature smaller than
itself, the dragon can respond with any of its physical attacks other than a
tail sweep.

Tail Sweep (Ex): A dragon of at least Gargantuan size can sweep with its tail
as a standard action. The sweep affect a half circle with a diameter of 30
feet, centered on the dragon’s rear. A Colossal dragon’s tail sweep has a
40-foot radius.

Creatures within the swept area are affected if they are four or more sizes
smaller than the dragon. The sweep deals the damage listed in Table: Dragon
Age Categories; a successful Reflex save halves the damage.

Spells: A dragon knows and casts arcane spells as a Mage of the level
indicated on Table: Dragon Spells and Spell-like Abilities, gaining bonus
spells for a high Intelligence score.

Spell-Like Abilities: A young or older dragon gains a spell-like ability upon
reaching its new age category, as noted in Table: Dragon Spell-like Abilities.
Once the dragon selects a spell-like ability for a given age category, it
cannot swap that ability for another. The dragon retains all previously
selected spell-like abilities and uses its age category as its caster level.
The save DC is 10 + the dragon’s Charisma modifier + spell level.

Spell Resistance (Ex): As dragons age, they become more resistant to spells
and spell-like abilities, as listed in Table: Dragon Age Categories.

Immunities (Ex): All dragons are immune to sleep and paralysis effects.
Dragons are also immune to certain energy types depending on their color:
Black, green, and copper dragons are immune to acid.

Blue and bronze dragons are immune to electricity.

Red, brass, and gold dragons are immune to fire and take 50% more damage
against cold-based attacks on a failed save.

White and silver dragons are immune to cold and take 50% more damage against
fire-based attacks on a failed save.

Blindsight (Ex): A dragon can ascertain creatures by nonvisual means (mostly
hearing and scent, but also by noticing vibration and other environmental
clues) with a range of 30 feet x the dragon’s age category.

Keen Senses (Ex): A dragon has low-light vision and darkvision with a range of
100 feet x the dragon’s age category.
