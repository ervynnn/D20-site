##  Dryad

###  Species Traits

Dryads have the following traits:

Spell-Like Abilities: At will—entangle (DC 13), speak with plants, tree shape;
3/day—charm person (DC 13), deep slumber (DC 15), tree stride;
1/day—suggestion (DC 15). 6th-level caster. The save DCs are Wisdom-based.

Tree Dependent (Su): Each dryad is mystically bound to a single, enormous
tree, or a copse of trees situated in one place (such as a lobby atrium) and
must never stray more than 300 yards from it. Any who do stray from their
trees become ill and die within 4d6 hours. A dryad’s tree does not radiate
magic.

Wild Empathy (Ex): A dryad can use body language, vocalizations, and demeanor
to improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions like a Diplomacy
check made to improve the attitude of a person. The dryad rolls 1d20 +10 (+6
species bonus, +4 Charisma bonus) to determine the wild empathy check result.
The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild
animals are usually unfriendly.
