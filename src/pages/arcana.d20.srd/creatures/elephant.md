##  Elephant

###  Species Traits

Elephants have the following traits:

Trample (Ex): An elephant can trample Medium or smaller creatures for 2d6+15
points of damage. Opponents who do not make attacks of opportunity against the
elephant can attempt a Reflex save (DC 25) to halve the damage. The mastadon’s
trample deals 2d6+18 points of damage (Reflex save, DC 31, for half damage).
Scent (Ex): This ability allows the elephant to detect approaching enemies,
sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Low-Light Vision (Ex): Elephants can see twice as far as a human in starlight,
moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. They
retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
