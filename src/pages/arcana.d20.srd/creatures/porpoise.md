##  Porpoise

Porpoises measure 4–6 feet long and weigh 110 to 170 pounds. The following
stats may also be used to describe whales of similar size.

###  Species Traits

Porpoises have the following traits:

Aquatic: Porpoises can move in water without making Swim checks and cannot
drown in water.

Blindsight (Ex): Porpoises can “see” by emitting high-frequency sounds,
inaudible to most other creatures. This form of echolocation allows them to
locate objects and creatures within 120 feet. A silence spell negates this and
forces the porpoise to rely on its vision, which is approximately as good as a
human’s.

Skill Bonuses: Porpoises gain a +4 species bonus on Listen and Spot checks.
These bonuses are lost if blindsight is negated.

Bonus Feat: Porpoises gain the bonus feat Weapon Finesse (slam).
