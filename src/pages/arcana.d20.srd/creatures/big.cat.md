###  Species Traits

Big cats have the following traits:

Pounce (Ex): If a big cat leaps upon a foe during the first round of combat,
it can make a full attack even if it has already taken a move action.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the big cat must hit with its bite
attack. If it gets a hold, it can rake.

Rake (Ex): If a big cat successfully grabs its prey (see Improved Grab,
above), it can make two rake attacks (+6 melee) with its hind legs as part of
a full attack. Each successful rake attack deals 1d3+1 points of damage.

Scent (Ex): This ability allows the big cat to detect approaching enemies,
sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Low-Light Vision (Ex): Big cats can see twice as far as a human in starlight,
moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. They
retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.

Skill Bonuses: Big cats gain a +8 species bonus on Balance checks and a +4
species bonus on Hide, Jump, and Move Silently checks (for running jumps, the
Jump bonus is +8).

Bonus Feats: Big cats gain the bonus feats Weapon Finesse (bite) and Weapon
Finesse (claw).
