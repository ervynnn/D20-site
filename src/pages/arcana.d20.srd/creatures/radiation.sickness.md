##  Radiation Sickness

When characters are exposed to radiation, they may be afflicted with radiation
sickness. Radiation sickness functions exactly like exposure to any other
disease, following the normal rules for diseases. The Fortitude save DC and
the effects of radiation sickness vary with the dose of radiation to which a
creature is exposed.

Radiation exposure has five degrees: mild, low, moderate, high, and severe. To
determine the degree of exposure, start with the type of exposure: either an
irradiated area or a specific source of radiation. Then consult Table:
Radiation Exposure to determine the degree of exposure based on the total time
of exposure within a given 24-hour period (rounding up).

The degree of the exposure determines the severity of the radiation sickness,
as indicated on Table: Radiation Sickness. At low levels, radiation sickness
is a slow disease. Often, a sick character suffers no severe short-term
effects. This is reflected in the fact that even with a failed Fortitude save,
the character might not suffer any Constitution loss.
