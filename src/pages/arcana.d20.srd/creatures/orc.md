##  Orc

Orcs read, write, and speak their own language (Orc). A few particularly
intelligent orcs speak other local or Shadow languages, including Goblin and
Giant.

###  Species Traits

Orcs have the following traits:

Darkvision (Ex): Orcs can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black
and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and orcs can function
with no light at all.

Light Sensitivity (Ex): Orcs suffer a –1 penalty to attack rolls in bright
sunlight or within the radius of effects or spells that duplicate bright
sunlight (such as daylight).

Bonus Feats: Orcs receive the bonus feats Archaic Weapons Proficiency, Armor
Proficiency (light), and Armor Proficiency (medium). They may treat orc double
axes as archaic weapons instead of exotic weapons.
