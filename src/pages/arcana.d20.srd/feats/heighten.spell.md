You can cast a spell as if it were a higher level than it actually is.

**Benefit:** A heightened spell has a higher spell level than normal. Unlike
other metamagic feats, Heighten Spell actually increases the effective level
of the spell that it modifies. All effects dependent on spell level (such as
saving throw DCs) are calculated according to the heightened level. The
heightened spell is as difficult to prepare and cast as a spell of its
effective level.
