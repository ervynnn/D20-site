You make one of your powers last all day.

**Prerequisite:** Extend Power.

**Benefit:** A persistent power has a duration of 24 hours. The persistent
power must have a personal range or a fixed range; you canâ€™t use this feat on
a power with a variable range, or on a power with an instantaneous duration.
Note that you must concentrate on some powers to use their effects (for
example, detect psionics and detect thoughts); concentration on such a power
is an attack or move action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. A
persistent power costs a number of power points equal to its standard cost +8.
