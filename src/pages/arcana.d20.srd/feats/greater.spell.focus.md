##  Greater Spell Focus

Choose a school of magic, such as Evocation or Illusion, for which you have
already selected the Spell Focus feat. Your spells of that school are even
more potent than normal.

Prerequisites: Spell Focus, caster level 6.

**Benefit:** Add +2 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against
spells from the focused school of magic you select. This overlaps (does not
stack) with the bonus from Spell Focus (see below).

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack
with itself. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new school of magic.
