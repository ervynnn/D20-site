## Magical Heritage [Initial]

You have magical ability in your background, such as a sorcerer in your
bloodline, or you gained access to magic at a particularly young age (by
discovering a spellbook in your attic, for example). As a result, you mastered
some basic spellcasting.

**Prerequisite:** Intelligence 10.

**Benefit:** Choose three 0-level arcane spells (“cantrips”). You may cast
each of these spells once per day per your arcane spellcasting level (minimum
1). You are treated as a Mage for purposes of arcane spell failure chance when
you are wearing armor.

**Special:** You may only take this feat as a 1st-level character.
