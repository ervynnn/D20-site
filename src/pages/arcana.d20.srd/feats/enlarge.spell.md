title: Enlarge Spell

You can cast spells farther than normal.

**Benefit:** An enlarged spell has its range doubled. Spells whose ranges are
not defined by distance do not have their ranges increased. A spell whose area
or effect is determined by its range (such as bless or a cone spell) has the
dimensions of its area or effect increased proportionally.

An enlarged spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spellâ€™s
actual level.
