title: Delay Power
layout: '~/layouts/MarkdownLayout.astro'

You can manifest powers that trigger a set duration after manifestation.

**Benefit:** A delayed power doesnâ€™t activate until 1 to 5 rounds after you
finish manifesting it. You determine the delay when manifesting the power, and
it cannot be changed once set. The power activates just before your turn on
the round you designate. Only area, personal, and touch powers may be affected
by this feat. Any decisions you would make about the power (including attack
rolls, designating targets, or determining or shaping an area) are decided
when the power is manifested, while any effects resolved by those affected by
the power (including saving throws) are decided when the power triggers. A
delayed power may be negated normally during the delay, and can be detected
normally in the area or on the target with powers that can detect psionic
effects. A delayed power costs a number of power points equal to its standard
cost +6.
