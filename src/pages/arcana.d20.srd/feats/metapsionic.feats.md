Metapsionic feats are to psionics as metamagic feats are to spells.
Metapsionic feats allow a psionic character to enhance the manifestation of a
regular power. Using a metapsionic feat doesn’t take any longer but does
increase the total power point cost to manifest the power.

A psionic character can use multiple metapsionic feats on a power, and the
extra power point cost is cumulative, but a power altered by metapsionic feats
can never cost more power points than the manifester’s level minus one
(minimum 1).

With the proper item creation feat, you can store a power enhanced by a
metapsionic feat in an item, such as a psionic tattoo.
