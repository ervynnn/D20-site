##  Precise Strike

Your strikes against an opponent are treated as touch attacks.

**Prerequisite:** Base attack bonus +5.

**Benefit:** Before making an attack on your turn, choose a single opponent
and spend an action point. Until the beginning of your next turn, any attacks
you make against that opponent use that opponent’s touch Defense instead of
the opponent’s normal Defense.
