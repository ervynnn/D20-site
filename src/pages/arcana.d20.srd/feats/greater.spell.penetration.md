##  Greater Spell Penetration

Your spells are remarkably potent, breaking through spell resistance more
readily than normal.

Prerequisites: Spell Penetration.

**Benefit:** You get a +4 bonus on caster level checks (1d20 + caster level)
to beat a creatureâ€™s spell resistance. This overlaps (does not stack) with the
bonus from Spell Penetration (see below).
