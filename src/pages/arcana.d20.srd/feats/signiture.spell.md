## Signature Spell

You are so familiar with a mastered spell that you can spontaneously cast it,
converting other prepared spells into that spell.

**Prerequisite:** Spell Mastery ability.

**Benefit:** Each time you take this feat, choose a spell that you have
mastered with Spell Mastery. You may now convert prepared arcane spells of
that spellâ€™s level or higher into this signature spell, just as an Acolyte of
good allegiance may spontaneously cast prepared spells as cure spells.

**Special:** You may gain this feat multiple times. Each time you take the
feat, it applies to a new spell that meets the prerequisites.
