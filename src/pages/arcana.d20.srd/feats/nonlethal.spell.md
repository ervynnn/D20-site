You can modify a spell to deal nonlethal instead of lethal damage.

**Benefit:** You may modify a spell that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal
damage instead. All other effects of the spell remain normal (for example, a
nonlethal fireball may still set flammable objects ablaze).

A nonlethal spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spellâ€™s
actual level.
