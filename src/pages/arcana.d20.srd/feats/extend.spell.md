You can cast spells that last longer than normal.

**Benefit:** An extended spell lasts twice as long as normal. Spells with a
concentration, instantaneous, or permanent duration are not affected by this
feat.

An extended spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spellâ€™s
actual level.
