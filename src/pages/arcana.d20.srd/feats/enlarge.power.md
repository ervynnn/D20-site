You can manifest powers farther than normal.

**Benefit:** An enlarged power has its range doubled. Powers whose ranges are
not defined by distance do not have their ranges increased. Determine an
enlarged powerâ€™s area or effect as if you were two manifester levels higher
than you actually are. An enlarged power costs a number of power points equal
to its standard cost +2.
