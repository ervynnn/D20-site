##  Enlarge Power [Metapsionic]

You can manifest powers farther than normal.

**Benefit:** An enlarged power has its range doubled. Powers whose ranges are
not defined by distance do not have their ranges increased. Determine an
enlarged power’s area or effect as if you were two manifester levels higher
than you actually are. An enlarged power costs a number of power points equal
to its standard cost +2.
