##  Empower Spell [Metamagic]

You can cast spells to greater effect.

**Benefit:** All variable, numeric effects of an empowered spell are increased
by one-half. An empowered spell deals half again as much damage as normal,
cures half again as many hit points, affects half again as many targets, and
so forth, as appropriate. For example, an empowered magic missile deals 1 1/2
times normal damage (roll 1d4+1 and multiply the result by 1.5 for each
missile). Saving throws and opposed rolls (such as the one you make when you
cast dispel magic) are not affected. Spells without random variables are not
affected.

An empowered spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spellâ€™s
actual level.
