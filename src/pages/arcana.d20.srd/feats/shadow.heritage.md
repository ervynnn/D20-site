---[Initial]

You have a creature of Shadow in your distant ancestry. The exact nature of
that shadowblood is immaterial (though it may be a source of adventure), as
the overpowering human genetic tide has reduced its special abilities to a few
salient features.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 inherent bonus on one saving throw of your choice.
You also gain low-light vision, which allows you to see twice as far as a
normal human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of
poor illumination. You retain the ability to distinguish color and detail
under these conditions.

**Special:** You may only take this feat as a 1st-level character.
