You can manifest a power simultaneously with another power just like it.

**Benefit:** Manifesting a power altered by this feat causes the power to take
effect twice on the target, as if you were simultaneously manifesting the same
power two times on the same location or target. Any variables in the power
(such as targets, shaping an area, and so on) apply to both of the resulting
powers. The target suffers all the effects of both powers individually and
receives a saving throw for each. In some cases, failure of both of the
targetâ€™s saving throws results in redundant effects, such as a twinned charm
person, although any ally of the target would have to succeed at two negate
attempts in order to free the target from the charm. A twinned power costs a
number of power points equal to its standard cost +8.
