You can manifest powers as free actions with but a momentâ€™s thought.

**Benefit:** You can perform another action, even manifest another power, in
the same round as you manifest a quickened power. You may only manifest one
quickened power per round. A power whose manifesting time is more than 1 full
round cannot be quickened.

A quickened power does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

The quickened power costs a number of power points equal to its standard cost
+8.
