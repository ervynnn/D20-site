You may score critical hits against creatures that are normally unaffected by
critical hits.

**Prerequisite:** Base attack bonus +2 or better.

**Benefit:** When you roll a threat against a creature normally unaffected by
critical hits (such as a construct, ooze, or undead), you may check for a
critical hit and deal the increased damage if the threat is confirmed.
Creatures unaffected by massive damage are still unaffected by massive damage
resulting from a critical hit. This is a supernatural ability.
