You can cast spells imbued with divine energy.

**Benefit:** Half of the damage dealt by a sacred spell is converted into
divine energy, and as such is not prevented by abilities or spells that reduce
or prevent damage from a particular type of energy. For example, half the
damage from a sacred flaming wrath spell would not be negated by fire
resistance or fire immunity. Only divine spells that deal damage may be made
into sacred spells.

A sacred spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spellâ€™s actual
level.
