##  Vehicular Magic Items

This section describes several magic “accessories” for vehicles.

A vehicular magic item functions only when it is properly placed on or within
the vehicle: either attached to the vehicle in its proper place, painted on
the vehicle, or incorporated into its design. Simply placing an item in the
front seat will not activate the item’s magic effect. Removing the vehicular
magic item from its intended location also ends the effect, although the item
continues to radiate magic.
