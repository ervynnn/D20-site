##  Limits for FX Items on Vehicles

Just as characters are limited in their ability to carry magic items, a
vehicle can only bear so many functional magic items. The limits are as
follows:

1 ramplate or set of bumpers  
1 steering wheel  
1 coat of paint  
1 set of tires  
1 pair of headlights  
1 horn or siren  
1 containment area (ashtray, glove compartment, trunk, etc.)  
1 non-electronic accessory (hung from the rear view mirror, on the dashboard,
etc.)  
1 seat or set of seats  
1 engine or engine accessory  
1 set of windows (including windshield and side windows)  
2 electronic accessories (stereo, CB radio, car alarm, etc.)
