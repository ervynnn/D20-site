##  Artifact Purchase DCs

Artifacts cannot generally be purchased on the open market, although a
careless vendors might sell one inadvertantly (by failing to realize its true
nature or power). Since artifacts are often unique items, one must strike a
deal with the current owner (who usually demands an exorbitant price). Players
may not equip their characters with artifacts without their GM’s permission.

For the purposes of reward values, an artifact’s purchase DC is 30 + its FX
modifier. The FX modifier depends on the item’s nature, as shown below:


<table> <tr> <th> Artifact Effects </th> <th> FX Modifier </th> </tr> <tr> <td> Each single-use effect </td> <td> — </td> </tr> <tr class="shaded"> <td> Each continuous effect, permanent effect, or +3 enhancement bonus </td> <td> +10 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> Each effect with a limited number of uses per day, or each +2 enhancement bonus </td> <td> +7 </td> </tr> <tr class="shaded"> <td> Each effect with a limited number of charges, or each +1 enhancement bonus </td> <td> +5 </td> </tr> </table>
