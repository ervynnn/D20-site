##  Recharge

Conjuration (Healing)

Level: Divine 3; Components: V, S, F; Casting Time: Attack action; Range:
Touch; Target: Creature touched; Duration: Instantaneous and special (see
text); Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless); Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

By converting electrical energy into eldritch power, you can recover quickly
from debilitating physical effects. However, you must draw current from a wall
socket to power this healing magic.

The recharge spell instantly eliminates the following conditions: cowering,
dazed, exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, shaken, and stunned. The caster can
heal herself of some of these conditions, but others (such as stunned) donâ€™t
allow spellcasting or other actions.

In addition, the recharge spell instantly cures blindness or deafness caused
by a spell or spell-like ability, and it grants a +4 bonus on Fortitude saves
against poison for 1 minute.

Focus: An active electrical outlet.
