Range: Touch; Target: Living creature touched; Duration: Instantaneous and 1
hour (see text); Saving Throw: None; Spell Resistance: Yes

You must succeed at a melee touch attack. Your touch deals 1d6 points of
damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6). You gain temporary hit points
equal to the damage you deal. However, you can’t gain more than the target’s
current hit points +10, which is enough to kill the target. The temporary hit
points disappear 1 hour later.
