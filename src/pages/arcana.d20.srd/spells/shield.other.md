## Shield Other

Abjuration

Level: Divine 2; Components: V, S, F; Casting Time: Attack action; Range:
Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels); Target: One creature; Duration: 1 hour/level
(D); Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless); Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

This spell creates a mystic connection between you and the subject so that
some of the subjectâ€™s wounds are transferred to you. The subject gains a +1
deflection bonus to Defense and a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws.
Additionally, the subject takes only half damage from all wounds and attacks
(including damage dealt by special abilities) that deal hit point damage. The
amount of damage not taken by the warded creature is taken by you. Forms of
harm that do not involve hit points, such as charm effects, temporary ability
damage, and level draining are not affected. If the subject suffers a
reduction of hit points from a lowered Constitution score, the reduction is
not split with you because it is not hit point damage. When the spell ends,
subsequent damage is no longer divided between the subject and you, but damage
already split is not reassigned to the subject.

If you and the subject of the spell move out of range of each other, the spell
ends.

Focus: A pair of platinum rings (purchase DC 15 each) worn by both you and the
warded creature.
