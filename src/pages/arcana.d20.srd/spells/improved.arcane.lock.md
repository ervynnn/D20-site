## Improved Arcane Lock

Abjuration

Level: Arcane 3; Range: Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level); Target: One door,
cabinet, chest, or portal/level, up to 30 sq. ft./ level each; Duration: 1
hour/level

As arcane lock, except as described above. Additionally, improved arcane lock
closes all targeted doors or containers if theyâ€™re open when the spell is
cast, then locks them. Unlike most spells, the caster need not have an
unblocked line of effect to each door targeted by the spell, but the caster
must know the location of each door. Mages and Techno Mages often use improved
arcane lock to simultaneously close and lock every door in a building, either
to trap something inside or lock something out.
