## Seeming

Illusion

Level: Arcane 5; Components: V, S; Casting Time: Attack action; Range: Close
(25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels); Targets: One creature/two levels, no two of which
can be more than 30 ft. apart; Duration: 12 hours (D); Saving Throw: Will
negates or Will disbelief (if interacted with); Spell Resistance: Yes or No
(see text)

This glamer functions like the change self spell except you can change the
appearance of other creatures as well. Affected creatures resume their normal
appearances if slain. Unwilling targets can negate the spell’s effect on them
by making Will saves or with spell resistance.
