The subject and all her gear become insubstantial, misty (or smoky), and
translucent. The subject gains damage reduction 10/+1. Her material armor
(including natural armor) becomes worthless, though her size, Dexterity,
deflection bonuses, and Defense bonuses from force armor (for example, from
the mage armor spell) still apply. She becomes immune to poison and critical
hits. She can’t attack or cast spells with verbal, somatic, material, or focus
components while in gaseous form. The subject loses supernatural abilities
while in gaseous form. If she has a touch spell ready to use, it is discharged
harmlessly when the spell takes effect.

The gaseous subject can’t run but she can fly (speed 10 feet, perfect
maneuverability). She can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even
mere cracks, with all she was wearing or holding in her hands, as long as the
spell persists. She is subject to wind. She can’t enter water or other liquid.

Material Component: A bit of gauze or pinch of ash.
