##  Arcane Graffiti

Conjuration (Creation)

Level: Arcane 0; Components: V, S; Casting Time: Attack action; Range: 0 ft.;
Effect: One personal rune or short message; Duration: Instantaneous; Saving
Throw: None; Spell Resistance: No

This spell allows you to inscribe your personal rune or a short message, which
can be no larger than 2 feet tall and consist of no more than six words, on a
nonliving creature or object. The writing can be visible or invisible. An
arcane graffiti spell enables you to etch the words upon any substance (even
stone or metal) without harming the material upon which the mark is placed. If
invisible graffiti is made, the casting of any spell or use of any spell-like
ability within 30 feet causes the words to become visible for 5 rounds.

The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or with a
clean spell.
