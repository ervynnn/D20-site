Illusion [Fear, Mind-Affecting]

Level: Arcane 4; Components: V, S; Casting Time: Attack action; Range: Medium
(100 ft. + 10 ft./level); Target: One living creature; Duration:
Instantaneous; Saving Throw: Will disbelief (if interacted with), then
Fortitude partial; Spell Resistance: Yes

You create the phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to
the subject simply by forming the fears of the subject’s subconscious mind
into something that its conscious mind can visualize: this most horrible
beast. Only the spell’s subject can perceive the phantasmal killer. You see
only a shadowy shape. The subject first gets a Will save to recognize the
image as unreal. If the subject fails the Will save, the phantasm touches him,
and he must succeed at a Fortitude save or die from fear. Even if the
Fortitude save is successful, the subject takes 3d6 points of damage.
