Evocation [Darkness]

Level: Divine 2; Components: V, DF; Casting Time: Attack action; Range: Touch;
Target: Object touched; Duration: 10 minutes/level (D); Saving Throw: None;
Spell Resistance: No

This spell causes an object to radiate darkness out to a 20- foot radius. Not
even creatures who can normally see in the dark (such as with darkvision) can
see in an area shrouded in magical darkness. Normal lights (flashlights,
candles, lanterns, and so forth) do not illuminate the darkened area, nor do
light spells of lower level (such as light and dancing lights). Darkness and
the 2nd-level spell daylight cancel each other, leaving whatever light
conditions normally prevail in the overlapping areas of the spells.

If the spell is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a
lightproof covering, the spellâ€™s effects are blocked until the covering is
removed.

Darkness counters or dispels any light spell of equal or lower level.
