The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by divination and
detection spells, such as scrying. Nondetection also prevents location by such
magic items as crystal balls. If a divination is attempted against the warded
creature or item, the caster of the divination must succeed at a caster level
check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the
spellcaster who cast nondetection. If you cast nondetection on yourself or on
an item currently in your possession, the DC is 15 + your caster level.

If cast on a creature, nondetection wards the creatureâ€™s gear as well as the
creature itself.

Material Component: A pinch of diamond dust (purchase DC 10).
