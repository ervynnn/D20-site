Level: Arcane 2; Components: V, S; Casting Time: Attack action; Range:
Unlimited; Effect: A text message reaches an electronic device of someone you
know; Duration: Instantaneous; Saving Throw: None; Spell Resistance: No

You cause a text message of up to 25 words to appear on the screen of an
electronic device capable of receiving such messages, such as a cell phone,
pager, PDA, or computer. If the device is turned on, the message appears
instantly; if not, the message appears as soon as someone turns it on. The
message remains onscreen until read, then disappears, leaving no electronic
record of its appearance. You must have seen the device to send a message to
it.
