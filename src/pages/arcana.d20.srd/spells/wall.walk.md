An improved version of the spider climb spell, wall walk allows for faster,
easier movement. The subject can travel on vertical surfaces or ceilings as
well as they can walk on the ground. No matter how smooth the wall, the
subject of a wall walk spell can run up it or even fight from a sideways
position, never needing to make Climb checks to do so. The subject can switch
from floor to walls to ceilings as many times as his speed allows.

Unlike the spider climb spell, wall walk doesnâ€™t require the subject to use
his hands to climb, so the subject can hold items and wield weapons normally.

Material Component: A black strip of Velcro.
