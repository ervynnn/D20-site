All electrical devices within the spell’s area—lights, computers, cell phones,
digital watches, and so forth—do not function for the duration of the spell.
The spell does not prevent devices outside of the area of effect from
operating normally, even if they are on the same electrical circuit as those
affected. (Even if the spell is cast on a generator supplying power to devices
outside the area of effect, those outside devices continue to remain powered.)
At the end of the spell’s duration, the devices operate again as if their
operation had not been interrupted. (Computers do not need to be restarted,
and clocks display the correct time.) Many sophisticated mechanical devices,
including automobiles and aircraft, rely on electrical components, and so are
usually affected by this spell.

Arcane Material Components: The CONTROL, ALT, and DELETE keys from a computer
keyboard.
