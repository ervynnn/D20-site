Level: Arcane 1, Divine 1; Components: V, S, M; Casting Time: Full-round
action; Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels); Target: One creature, object
of up to 1,000 lb./level, or room of up to 100 square feet/level; Duration:
Instantaneous; Saving Throw: Fortitude negates (harmless); Spell Resistance:
Yes (harmless)

The clean spell completely eliminates grime, dirt, and bacterial contaminants
from the target. Smooth surfaces gain a faint shine, as if they had been
polished.

If cast on a room or object, the clean spell destroys dirt, dust, and anything
else that would ordinarily be wiped away with a thorough mundane cleaning. The
room or object retains no fingerprints, and even the smallest hairs, skin
cells, and garment fibers are cleaned away—rendering most evidence collection
impossible, for example.

If cast on a creature, the clean spell disinfects wounds (doubling the natural
healing rate for that day) and renders the creature scentless for 1 minute.
This means that creatures with the scent extraordinary ability won’t be able
to detect the subject by scent alone.

Material Component: Bar of soap.
