When you cast this spell, you touch one creature (yourself or someone else).
The spell eliminates all physical evidence left by that person’s body
(fingerprints, fluids, hairs, and so forth) within the affected area along
with any evidentiary materials accidentally deposited by that person’s body,
clothes, or gear (such as fibers, mud, dust, and so forth). The spell only
affects materials no larger than a few strands of hair or a few ounces of
dirt. It does not change any disturbances that person created (including
footprints, tool marks, or broken items) or remove any object the target
person deliberately left.

Arcane Material Component: A pair of tweezers.
