## Obscuring Mist

Conjuration (Creation)

Level: Arcane 1, Divine 1; Components: V, S; Casting Time: Attack action;
Range: 30 ft.; Effect: Cloud centered on you spreads 30 ft. and is 20 ft.
high; Duration: 1 minute/level; Saving Throw: None; Spell Resistance: No

A misty vapor arises around you. It is stationary once created. The vapor
obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet
away has one-half concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures
farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot
use sight to locate the target).

A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+
mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. A fireball, flaming wrath, or similar spell
burns away the fog in the spellâ€™s area. A wall of fire burns away the fog in
the area into which it deals damage.

This spell does not function underwater.
