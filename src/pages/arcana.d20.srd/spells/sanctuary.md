##  Sanctuary

Abjuration

Level: Divine 1; Components: V, S, DF; Casting Time: Attack action; Range:
Touch; Target: Creature touched; Duration: 1 round/level; Saving Throw: Will
negates; Spell Resistance: No

Any opponent attempting to strike or otherwise directly attack the warded
creature, even with a targeted spell, must attempt a Will save. If the save
succeeds, the opponent can attack normally and is unaffected by that casting
of the spell. If the save fails, the opponent can’t follow through with the
attack, that part of the attacker’s action is lost, and the attacker can’t
directly attack the warded creature for the duration of the spell. Those not
attempting to attack the subject remain unaffected.

This spell does not prevent the warded creature from being attacked or
affected by area or effect spells. The subject cannot attack without breaking
the spell but may use nonattack spells or otherwise act. This allows a warded
acolyte to heal wounds, for example, or to bless, perform an augury, summon
creatures, and so on.
