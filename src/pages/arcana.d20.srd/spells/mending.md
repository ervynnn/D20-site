## Mending

Transmutation

Level: Arcane 0, Divine 0; Components: V, S; Casting Time: Attack action;
Range: 10 ft.; Target: One object of up to 1 pound/level; Duration:
Instantaneous; Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless, object); Spell
Resistance: Yes (harmless, object)

Mending repairs small breaks or tears in objects (not warps). In metallic
objects, it will weld a broken chain link, a necklace, or a knife, providing
but one break exists. Ceramic or wooden objects with multiple breaks can be
rejoined to be as strong as new. A hole in a backpack or garment is completely
healed over by mending. The spell can repair a magic item, but the itemï¿½s
magical abilities are not restored. The spell has no effect on creatures (even
constructs).
