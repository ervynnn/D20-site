##  Crawling Carpet

Conjuration (Summoning)

Level: Divine 4; Components: V, S, DF; Casting Time: Fullround action; Range:
Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level); Effect: Carpet of monstrous spiders, scarab
beetles, or centipedes filling a 10-ft.-radius spread; Duration: 1
minute/level; Saving Throw: None; Spell Resistance: No

You summon a number of monstrous insect swarms, each of which attacks any
creature occupying its square. Each square of the spell’s effect contains a
swarm of monstrous spiders, monstrous scarab beetles, or monstrous centipedes,
to a maximum of 12 swarms, assuming that the spell’s effect isn’t blocked by
obstacles. The swarms are stationary after being summoned, and won’t pursue
creatures that flee. Use the monstrous spider swarm statistics for monstrous
scarab beetle swarms and monstrous centipede swarms as well.
