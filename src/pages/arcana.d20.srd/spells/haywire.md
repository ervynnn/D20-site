The haywire spell causes a single device to behave randomly and erratically,
defying any attempts to bring it under control. Cash registers display random
prices and open their money drawers repeatedly. Escalators surge forward, then
reverse themselves. Automatic teller machines flash random patrons’ account
balances on the screen as they spew forth receipts (not money, though).

It’s impossible to describe the exact effects of haywire on every modern
device. In general, a machine subject to haywire functions as if someone were
pressing random buttons or otherwise manipulating it randomly.

Turning off a device subject to a haywire spell doesn’t work, because the
spell disables the “off” switch. Cutting off the power supply (by unplugging
it, for example) disables the device 1d4 rounds later, ending the spell.

Material Component: A small magnet.
