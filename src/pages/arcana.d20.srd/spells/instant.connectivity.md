##  Instant Connectivity

Conjuration (Teleporting)

Level: Arcane 5; Components: V, S, F; Casting Time: Attack action; Range:
Touch (see text); Target: Creature touched, or up to eight willing creatures
joining hands; Duration: Instantaneous; Saving Throw: Will negates; Spell
Resistance: Yes

Instant connectivity can only be cast through a computer network (see the
Casting Spells through Email sidebar). With the aid of instant messaging
software, you physically transport the subject or subjects from one place to
another. If several willing persons link hands in a circle, up to eight
creatures can be affected by the spell at the same time.

At least one of the creatures affected must be touching a computer with an
Internet connection and active instant messaging (IM) software. The targets
must be sent to a specific IM address that is currently active online. Instant
connectivity causes the targets to appear in the room from which that IM
address is being accessed, automatically gaining surprise on anyone else in
that room.

Focus: A computer hard drive (purchase DC 23 or higher).
