## Phantom Limousine

Conjuration (Creation)

Level: Arcane 5; Components: V, S, F; Casting Time: 1 minute; Range: 0 ft.;
Effect: One quasi-real limousine; Duration: 1 hour/level (D); Saving Throw:
None; Spell Resistance: No

You conjure forth a quasi-real limousine that seats eight Medium characters
(two in the front and six in a comfortable passenger area), four Large
creatures (one in the front and three in the back), or sixteen Small creatures
(four in the front and twelve in the back). The limousine has the exterior
color and design details you choose when you prepare the spell, and the
interior is one of opulent luxury. You decide what its license plates look
like when you cast the spell.

The phantom limousine has a Defense of 6, hardness of 15, and 50 hit points +1
point per caster level. If it loses all its hit points, the phantom limousine
disappears. A phantom limousine is much faster than it looks, with a top speed
of 60 feet per caster level, an initiative modifier of –2, and a maneuver
modifier of –2.

A phantom limousine has enough luxurious food and drink inside to provide a
hearty meal for all passengers. It has all the powers of a phantom chopper
(ability to drive over bad terrain, water, or air). Additionally, it is
airtight and can even travel underwater at a speed of 10 feet per caster
level.

Focus: A pair of car keys on a silver keychain.
