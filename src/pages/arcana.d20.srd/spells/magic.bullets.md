## Magic Bullets

Transmutation

Level: Arcane 4, Divine 4; Components: V, S, F; Casting Time: Attack action;
Range: Touch; Target: 50 bullets, all of which must be in contact with each
other at the time of casting; Duration: 1 hour/level; Saving Throw: Will
negates (harmless, object); Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless, object)

You enhance up to 50 individual bullets of the same caliber or a single
magazine of up to 50 rounds with the power of a 1stlevel spell you already
know. The bullets must be fired from a gun for the subsidiary magical effects
to take hold. The related spells you must know to create magic bullets of a
particular type are listed below.

Each time you cast the spell, all the bullets receive the same enchantment,
but afterward it is possible to mix magic bullets with different effects in
the same magazine. Be sure to note the order in which the bullets are loaded
to correctly track the effect of each shot. Unless otherwise noted, magic
bullets deal normal damage before they impart their magical effect. This spell
can be used to create one type of bullet (as noted in the chart below), or
others at the GM’s discretion.
