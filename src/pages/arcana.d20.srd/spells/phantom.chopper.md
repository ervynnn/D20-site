## Phantom Chopper

Conjuration (Creation)

Level: Arcane 3; Components: V, S; Casting Time: 10 minutes; Range: 0 ft.;
Effect: One quasi-real motorcycle; Duration: 1 hour/level (D); Saving Throw:
None; Spell Resistance: No

You conjure a quasi-real motorcycle. The motorcycle can be ridden only by you
or the one person for whom you specifically create the cycle. A phantom
chopper looks like a heavily customized motorcycle of indeterminate make and
model. It has realistic-looking license plates, and you decide what the
license plate says when you cast the spell.

The phantom chopper has a Defense of 10, hardness of 5, and 20 hit points +1
hit point per caster level. If it loses all its hit points, the phantom
chopper disappears. A phantom chopper has a top speed of 40 feet per caster
level, an initiative modifier of +0, and a maneuver modifier of +1.

The phantom choppers gains certain powers according to caster level. A
motorcycleâ€™s abilities include those of motorcycles of lower caster levels.

7th Level: The motorcycle can ride over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground
without difficulty or decrease in speed.

8th Level: The motorcycle can ride over water as if it were firm, dry ground.

9th Level: The motorcycle can ride in the air as if it were firm land, so
chasms and the like can be crossed without benefit of a bridge. The phantom
chopper cannot take off and fly. It can only ride horizontally across the air.
After 1 round in the air, the motorcycle falls.
