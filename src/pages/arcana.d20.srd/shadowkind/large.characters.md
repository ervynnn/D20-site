Large characters take a –1 size penalty to Defense, a –1 size penalty on
attack rolls, and a –4 size penalty on Hide checks. Large characters gain a +4
bonus on grapple checks.

Large characters’ lifting and carrying limits are twice of those of Medium
characters.

Large characters generally move as fast as Medium characters.

Large characters may use larger weapons than Medium characters. A Large
character may wield a weapon of Large size in one hand and a Huge weapon in
two hands. A Large character treats a weapon of Medium or smaller as a light
weapon.

Armor for Large creatures must be custom-made and weighs twice as much as
Medium armor of similar type. Increase the purchase DC of Large armor by +2.
