title: Native Shadowkind vs. New Arrivals

Characters can be nonhuman natives of our world—the children of one or more
Shadowkind parents, born and raised somewhere on Earth—or they can be new
arrivals to our world, having recently come through Shadow. In the latter
case, Shadowkind characters suffer the disadvantages of being “strangers in a
strange land.” They are restricted to a handful of starting occupations at 1st
level, they have no wealth to speak of, and they speak bizarre languages
unknown to the majority of Earth’s population (though they also acquire the
common language of the land they arrive in as a function of passing through
Shadow).
