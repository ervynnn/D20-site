size.

Orc Blood: For all special abilities and effects, a half-orc is considered as
an orc. Half-orcs, for example, are just as susceptible to special effects
that affect orcs as their orcish ancestors are, and they can use magic items
that are only usable by orcs.

and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and drow can function
with no light at all.

Speak Common (or local language), Speak Orc.
