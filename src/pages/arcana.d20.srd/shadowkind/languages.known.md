A character who begins play as a newly arrived Shadowkind knows one or more
languages, most of which are not spoken on Earth. Such languages include
Celestial, Draconic, Elven, and Goblin. However, they all share a common
language (called Common) that has striking parallels to the predominant
language spoken in the area where they arrived. Shadowkind characters born and
raised in our world gain languages as human characters do. In addition to one
or more local languages, they may know one or more languages of Shadow (taught
to them by their parents and elders).
