Conjuration (Healing)

Knowledge (arcane lore) DC: 32; Range: Touch; Target: Creature touched;
Duration: Instantaneous; Saving Throw: Yes (harmless; see text); Spell
Resistance: Yes (harmless)

Incantations developed with the heal seed channel positive energy into a
creature to wipe away disease and injury. Such an incantation completely cures
all diseases, blindness, deafness, hit point damage, and temporary ability
damage. To restore permanent ability damage, increase the Knowledge (arcane
lore) check DC by +4. The heal seed neutralizes poisons in the subject’s
system so that no additional damage or effects are suffered.

It offsets feeblemindedness and cures mental disorders caused by spells or
injury to the brain. It dispels all magical effects penalizing the character’s
abilities, including effects caused by spells and even incantations developed
with the afflict seed. Only a single application of the incantation is needed
to simultaneously achieve all these effects. It does not restore levels or
Constitution points lost due to death.

To dispel all negative energy levels afflicting the target, increase the
Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by +2.
