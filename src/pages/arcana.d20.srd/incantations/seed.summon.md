##  Seed: Summon

Conjuration (Summoning)

Knowledge (arcane lore) DC: 32; Range: Close; Effect: One summoned creature;
Duration: Rounds (D); Saving Throw: Will negates (see text); Spell Resistance:
Yes (see text)

You can summon an outsider. It appears where you designate and acts
immediately, on your turn, if its spell resistance is overcome and it fails a
Will saving throw. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If
you can communicate with the outsider, you can direct it not to attack, to
attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions.

The incantation conjures an outsider you select of CR 6 or less. For each +1
CR of the summoned outsider, increase the Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by
+2.

If you increase the Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by +6, you can summon a
creature of CR 6 or less from another monster type, such as giant, aberration,
or undead.

For each +1 CR of the summoned creature, increase the Knowledge (arcane lore)
check DC by +2. The summoned creature is assumed to have been plucked from
some faraway place (perhaps somewhere beyond Shadow). The summoned creature
attacks your opponents to the best of its ability, or if you can communicate
with it, it will perform other actions.

However, the summoning ends if the creature is asked to perform a task
inimical to its nature, such as commanding a good creature to attack an
innocent, or commanding any creature to commit suicide.
