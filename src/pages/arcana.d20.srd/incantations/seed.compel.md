##  Seed: Compel

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting, Language-Dependent]

Knowledge (arcane lore) DC: 30; Range: Close; Target: One living creature;
Duration: Hours (D); Saving Throw: Will negates; Spell Resistance: Yes You
compel a target to follow a specified course of activity.

At the basic level of effect, an incantation using the compel seed must be
worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Asking the
creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do
some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect. However,
urging a dragon to stop attacking your friends so that everyone could jointly
assault a mob safehouse elsewhere is a reasonable use of the incantationâ€™s
power.

The compelled course of activity can continue for the entire duration, such as
in the case of the dragon mentioned above. If the compelled activity can be
completed in a shorter time, the incantation ends when the subject finishes
what he was asked to do. You can instead specify conditions that will trigger
a special activity during the duration. For example, you might compel a rock
star to give her the first panhandler she meets a ride in her limo. If the
condition is not met before the incantation using this seed expires, the
activity is not performed.
