A satellite tracking incantation is among the most powerful means of locating
creatures or objects. You learn the exact location of a single individual or
object. Satellite tracking circumvents normal means of protection from scrying
or location.

The incantation reveals global positioning system (GPS) coordinates for the
subject, and a successful computer search (Computer Use check, DC 15) supplies
the name of the location (place, name, business name, building name, or the
like), community, county (or similar political division), and country where
the subject lies.

To find a creature with the spell, you must have seen the creature or have
some item that once belonged to it. To find an object, you must have touched
the object at least once.

Focus: A satellite dish, computer, and telemetry software (purchase DC 25).

Failure: Falsehood. The caster obtains bogus GPS data. At the GMâ€™s discretion,
the bogus data may lead the caster to a creature or object thematically
similar to the intended target.
