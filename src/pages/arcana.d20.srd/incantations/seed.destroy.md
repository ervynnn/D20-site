##  Seed: Destroy

Transmutation

Knowledge (arcane lore) DC: 30; Range: Long; Targets: 1 creature, or up to a
10-foot cube of nonliving matter; Duration: Instantaneous; Saving Throw:
Fortitude half; Spell Resistance: Yes

You deal 10d6 points of damage to the target. The damage is of no particular
type or energy—it is purely destructive. For each additional 1d6 points of
damage dealt, increase the Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by +2. If the
target is reduced to –10 hit points or less (or a construct, object, or undead
is reduced to 0 hit points), it is destroyed as if disintegrated, leaving
behind only a trace of fine dust. Up to a 10- foot cube of nonliving matter is
affected, so an incantation using the destroy seed destroys only part of any
very large object or structure targeted.

The destroy seed affects even magical matter, energy fields, and force effects
that are normally immune to damage, such as wall of force. Such effects are
automatically destroyed. Incantations using the ward seed may also be
destroyed, though you must succeed at an opposed Knowledge (arcane lore) check
against the other caster to bring down such an effect.
