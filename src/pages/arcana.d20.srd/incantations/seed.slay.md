##  Seed: Slay

Necromancy [Death]

Knowledge (arcane lore) DC: 34; Range: Medium; Target: One living creature;
Duration: Instantaneous; Saving Throw: Fortitude partial; Spell Resistance:
Yes An incantation developed using the slay seed snuffs out the life force of
a living creature, killing it instantly. The slay seed kills a creature of up
to 20 HD. The subject is entitled to a Fortitude saving throw to survive the
attack. If the save is successful, it instead takes 4d6 points of damage. For
each additional 20 HD affected (or each additional creature affected),
increase the Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by +8.

Alternatively, you can use the slay seed in an incantation to suppress the
life force of the target by bestowing 2d4 negative levels on the target (the
incantation bestows half as many negative levels on a successful Fortitude
save). For each additional 1d4 negative levels bestowed, increase the
Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by +4. If the subject has at least as many
negative levels as Hit Dice, it dies. Assuming the subject survives, the
negative levels will become permanently drained levels 24 hours later if the
subject fails a Fortitude saving throw.
