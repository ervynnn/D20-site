Knowledge (arcane lore) DC: 30; Range: Touch; Target: Creature touched;
Duration: Hours; Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless); Spell Resistance: Yes
(harmless)

Incantations using the fortify seed grant a +1 enhancement bonus to whichever
one of the following you choose:

  * Any one ability score. 
  * Any one kind of saving throw. 
  * Spell resistance. 
  * Natural armor bonus. 

The fortify seed can also grant energy resistance 1 for one energy type or 1
temporary hit point. For each additional +1 bonus, point of energy resistance,
or hit point, increase the Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by +2.

The fortify seed has a base Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC is 34 if it
grants a +1 bonus of a type other than enhancement (such as luck or insight).
For each additional +1 bonus of a type other than enhancement, increase the
Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by +4. If you apply a factor to make the
duration permanent, the bonus must be an inherent bonus, and the maximum
inherent bonus allowed is +5.

The fortify seed can also grant SR 22, and each additional point of spell
resistance increases the Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by +4 (each –1 to
spell resistance reduces the Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by –2). If an
incantation with the fortify seed grants an inanimate object an ability score
it wouldn’t normally possess (such as Intelligence), the incantation must also
incorporate the life seed.

The fortify seed can also grant damage reduction 10/+1. For each additional
point of damage reduction, increase the Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by
+1. For each additional point of required weapon enhancement above +1,
increase the Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by +3.
