The bibliolalia incantation puts you in an oracular trance as you pore through
books in a library. At the incantation’s conclusion, you uncover lore about an
important person, place, or thing beyond the limits of mundane research.

The information gleaned through a bibliolalia incantation isn’t necessarily
known to anyone, and it may not be in any of the books in the library.
Nonetheless, something within the books triggers the burst of magical
inspiration that reveals the information.

No set of rules can adequately describe how much information the bibliolalia
incantation provides. If you have the item or person at hand, you’ll learn
more than if you just have a name or a cryptic clue.

Focus: A large library with at least a token occult section (purchase DC 25).

Experience Point Cost: 200 XP.

Failure: Falsehood. The bibliolalia incantation reveals information that seems
accurate, but is actively misleading.
