Knowledge (arcane lore) DC: 30; Range: Touch; Target: Creature touched;
Duration: Hours (D); Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless); Spell Resistance:
Yes (harmless)

You grant a creature additional armor, providing a +4 bonus to Defense. The
bonus is either an equipment bonus or a natural armor bonus, whichever you
select. Unlike mundane armor, the armor seed provides an intangible protection
that entails no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed
reduction. Incorporeal creatures canâ€™t bypass the armor seed the way they can
ignore normal armor. For each additional point of Defense bonus, increase the
Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by +2.

You can also grant a creature a +1 bonus to Defense with different bonus
types, including deflection, insight, sacred, or others. For each additional
point of Defense bonus in one of these types, increase the Knowledge (arcane
lore) check DC by +10.
