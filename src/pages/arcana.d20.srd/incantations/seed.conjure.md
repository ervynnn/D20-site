Conjuration (Creation)

Knowledge (arcane lore) DC: 30; Range: 0 ft.; Effect: Unattended, nonmagical
object of nonliving matter, 20 cu. ft.; Duration: Hours; Saving Throw: None;
Spell Resistance: No

You create a nonmagical, unattended object of up to 20 cubic feet. You must
succeed at an appropriate skill check to make a complex item, such as a Craft
(mechanical) check to make a motorcycle. The object can be composed of any
organic or manufactured subtance (or combination of substances) with a
hardness of 10 or less. For each additional cubic foot of matter created,
increase the Knowledge (arcane lore) DC by +2.

Attempting to use any created object as a material component causes the spell
or incantation to fail and the object to disappear.
