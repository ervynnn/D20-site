31, 2 success; Failure: Two consecutive failed skill checks; Components: V, S,

Caduceus enables you to channel magic into a creature to wipe away injury and
afflictions. It immediately ends any and all of the following adverse
conditions affecting the target: temporary ability damage (but not permanent
ability drain), blindness (including dazzled effects), confusion or insanity,
daze, deafness, fatigue, exhaustion, feeblemindedness, nausea, and poison. It
also cures up to 150 points of damage. A single casting of the incantation is
enough to simultaneously achieve all these effects.

Caduceus also removes negative levels, but it does not restore permanently
drained levels.

The caduceus incantation has no effect on undead or constructs.

Focus: Medical equipment found in a hospital emergency room (purchase DC 25).

Failure: Death. Target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 15) or die. If the
save succeeds, the target is reduced to â€“1 hit points, unless he was already
below that.
