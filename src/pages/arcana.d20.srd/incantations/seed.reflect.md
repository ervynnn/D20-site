Knowledge (arcane lore) DC: 32; Range: Personal; Target: You; Duration: Until
expended or 12 hours

Attacks targeted against you rebound on the original attacker. Each use of the
reflect seed in an incantation is effective against one type of attack only:
spells (and incantations and spell-like effects), ranged attacks, or melee
attacks. To reflect an area spell, where you are not the target but are caught
in the vicinity, increase the Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by +8. A single
successful use of reflect expends its protection.

Incantations developed with the reflect seed against spells and spell-like
effects return spell effects of up to 1st level. For each additional level of
spells to be reflected, increase the Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by +6.
Other incantations are treated as 6th-level spells for this purpose.

Against 0- to 5th-level spells, the desired effect is automatically reflected.
An opposed Knowledge (arcane lore) check is required when the reflect seed is
used against another incantation. If the enemy caster gets his incantation
through by winning the Knowledge (arcane lore) check, the incantation using
the reflect seed is not expended, just momentarily suppressed.

If the reflect seed is used against a melee attack or ranged attack, five such
attacks are automatically reflected back on the original attacker. For each
additional attack reflected, increase the Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by
+4. The reflected attack rebounds on the attacker using the same attack roll.
Once the allotted attacks are reflected, the incantation using the reflect
seed is expended.
