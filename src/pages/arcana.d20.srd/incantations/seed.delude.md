##  Seed: Delude

Illusion

Knowledge (arcane lore) DC: 30; Range: Long; Effect: Visual figment that can
extend up to 12 10-ft. cubes (S); Duration: Minutes; Saving Throw: Will
disbelief (if interacted with); Spell Resistance: No

An incantation developed with the delude seed creates the visual illusion of
an object, creature, or force, as visualized by you. You can move the image
within the limits of the size of the effect by concentrating (the image is
otherwise stationary).

The image disappears when struck by an opponent unless you cause the illusion
to react appropriately. For an illusion that includes audible, olfactory,
tactile, taste, and thermal aspects, increase the Knowledge (arcane lore)
check DC by +2 per extra aspect. Even realistic tactile and thermal illusions
canâ€™t deal damage, however.

For each additional image with the effect, increase the Knowledge (arcane
lore) check DC by +1. For an illusion that follows a script determined by you,
increase the Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by +2. The illusion can include
intelligible speech if you wish.

For an illusion that makes any area appear to be something other than it is
(such as making a swamp appear as a grassland or a village), increase the
Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by +4. Additional components, such as sounds,
can be added as noted above. Concealing creatures requires additional
incantation development using this or other seeds.
