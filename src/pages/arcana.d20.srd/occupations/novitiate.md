Novitiates draw quiet strength from their belief in a greater power. They do
not necessarily have ties to a specific religion or denominationâ€”their faith
is enough. Some novitiates are lay clergy, counselors, motivational speakers,
social workers, or any other position involved with helping people who have
lost hope and faith.
