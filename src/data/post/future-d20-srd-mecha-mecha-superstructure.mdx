    Mecha Superstructure




    A mecha's superstructure--its exoskeleton, interior braces, and other structural parts--can be made from any sufficiently advanced metal alloy. Whatever its composition, a mecha's superstructure has a hardness that reduces the damage the mecha takes from weapons and collisions.




    To build a mecha superstructure from scratch, a character must succeed at a Craft (mechanical) check (DC 30) and a Craft (structural) check (DC 30) after investing the requisite amount of assembly time, based on the mecha's size: Large 150 hours, Huge 300 hours, Gargantuan 600 hours, Colossal 1,200 hours. A character without a mechanical tool kit takes a -4 penalty on both skill checks. The character must also make a Wealth check against the mecha's base purchase DC.




    Different types of superstructure materials are presented below and summarized in Table: Superstructure Materials.




    Hardness: The amount of damage the material absorbs from a weapon hit or collision.




    Base Purchase DC Modifier: The modifier applied to the mecha's base purchase DC.




    Restriction: Since mecha require a license to own and operate, the materials used for making them do not require special licenses to purchase.

###

    Alumisteel (PL 5)




    This easy-to-acquire alloy is lightweight and reasonably strong. Alumisteel can also be used for armor (see Mecha Armor, below).




    Hardness: 10.




    Base Purchase DC Modifier: -4.

###

    Duralloy (PL 6)




    Duralloy is harder, heavier, and more durable than alumisteel. It can also be used to fashion armor (see Mecha Armor, below).




    Hardness: 15.




    Base Purchase DC Modifier: None.

###

    Vanadium (PL 6)




    Vanadium alloy absorbs a respectable amount of damage and is easy to mold.




    Hardness: 20.




    Base Purchase DC Modifier: +4.

###

    Neovulcanium (PL 7)




    Similar to duralloy, neovulcanium uses plasma-forging techniques to create an alloy of unparalleled resilience. Neovulcanium can also be used for armor (see Mecha Armor, below).




    Hardness: 20.




    Base Purchase DC Modifier: None.

###

    Neutronite (PL 7)




    Neutronite is a tough steel alloy into which a weave of free neutrons has been pressed. It is extremely resilient but also incredibly massive, weighing approximately five times more than a similar volume of lead.




    Hardness: 25.




    Base Purchase DC Modifier: +4.

###

    Megatanium (PL 8)




    Sandwiched layers of crystal carbon and neovulcanium held in a magnetic matrix, megatanium is exceedingly hard and durable. Megatanium can also be used for armor (see Mecha Armor, below).




    Hardness: 30.




    Base Purchase DC Modifier: None.
