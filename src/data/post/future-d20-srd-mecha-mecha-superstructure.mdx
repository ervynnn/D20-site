## 
    Mecha Superstructure
   



    A mecha's superstructure--its exoskeleton, interior braces, and other structural parts--can be made from any sufficiently advanced metal alloy. Whatever its composition, a mecha's superstructure has a hardness that reduces the damage the mecha takes from weapons and collisions.
   



    To build a mecha superstructure from scratch, a character must succeed at a Craft (mechanical) check (DC 30) and a Craft (structural) check (DC 30) after investing the requisite amount of assembly time, based on the mecha's size: Large 150 hours, Huge 300 hours, Gargantuan 600 hours, Colossal 1,200 hours. A character without a mechanical tool kit takes a -4 penalty on both skill checks. The character must also make a Wealth check against the mecha's base purchase DC.
   



    Different types of superstructure materials are presented below and summarized in Table: Superstructure Materials.
   



    Hardness: The amount of damage the material absorbs from a weapon hit or collision.
   



    Base Purchase DC Modifier: The modifier applied to the mecha's base purchase DC.
   



    Restriction: Since mecha require a license to own and operate, the materials used for making them do not require special licenses to purchase.
   


| Table: Superstructure Materials |  |  |  |  |  |
| :--------------------------------- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | --: |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Alumisteel (PL 5) | 10 | 36 | 40 | 44 | 56 |
| Duralloy (PL 6) | 15 | 40 | 44 | 48 | 60 |
| Vanadium (PL 6) | 20 | 44 | 48 | 52 | 64 |
| Neovulcanium (PL 7) | 20 | 40 | 44 | 48 | 60 |
| Neutronite (PL 7) | 25 | 44 | 48 | 52 | 64 |
| Megatanium (PL 8) | 30 | 40 | 40 | 48 | 60 |



### 
    Alumisteel (PL 5)
   



    This easy-to-acquire alloy is lightweight and reasonably strong. Alumisteel can also be used for armor (see Mecha Armor, below).
   



    Hardness: 10.
   



    Base Purchase DC Modifier: -4.
   


### 
    Duralloy (PL 6)
   



    Duralloy is harder, heavier, and more durable than alumisteel. It can also be used to fashion armor (see Mecha Armor, below).
   



    Hardness: 15.
   



    Base Purchase DC Modifier: None.
   


### 
    Vanadium (PL 6)
   



    Vanadium alloy absorbs a respectable amount of damage and is easy to mold.
   



    Hardness: 20.
   



    Base Purchase DC Modifier: +4.
   


### 
    Neovulcanium (PL 7)
   



    Similar to duralloy, neovulcanium uses plasma-forging techniques to create an alloy of unparalleled resilience. Neovulcanium can also be used for armor (see Mecha Armor, below).
   



    Hardness: 20.
   



    Base Purchase DC Modifier: None.
   


### 
    Neutronite (PL 7)
   



    Neutronite is a tough steel alloy into which a weave of free neutrons has been pressed. It is extremely resilient but also incredibly massive, weighing approximately five times more than a similar volume of lead.
   



    Hardness: 25.
   



    Base Purchase DC Modifier: +4.
   


### 
    Megatanium (PL 8)
   



    Sandwiched layers of crystal carbon and neovulcanium held in a magnetic matrix, megatanium is exceedingly hard and durable. Megatanium can also be used for armor (see Mecha Armor, below).
   



    Hardness: 30.
   



    Base Purchase DC Modifier: None.
