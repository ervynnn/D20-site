## Energy Drain (Su)


This attack saps a living opponents vital energy. With each successful [melee
    attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions), the creature bestows one or more negative levels. If an attack that includes an energy drain scores a [critical
    hit](modern-d20-srd-combat-critical-hits), it drains double the given amount. For each negative level inflicted on an opponent, the draining creature heals 5 points of [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage). If the amount of healing is more than the damage the creature has taken, it gains any excess as [temporary
    hit points](modern-d20-srd-combat-death-dying-healing) that remain for a maximum of 1 hour.


For each negative level, the opponent takes a 1 penalty on all [skill
  checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics) and [ability checks](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores), [attack
  rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll), and [saving throws](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws), and loses one effective level or Hit Die (whenever level is used in a die roll or calculation). A character with spellcasting ability loses the ability to cast one spell of the highest level he or she can cast (players choice); this loss persists until the negative level is removed.


Negative levels remain until 24 hours have passed or until removed with a spell. If a negative level is not removed before 24 hours have passed, the afflicted opponent must attempt a [Fortitude
  save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) with a DC of 10 + 1/2 draining creatures HD + draining creatures [Charisma
  modifier](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) (the exact DC is given in the creatures Species Traits). On a success, the negative level goes away with no harm to the creature. On a failure, the negative level goes away, but the creatures level is reduced by one. A separate saving throw is required for each negative level. A creature that loses all of its levels or Hit Dice dies and, depending on the source of the energy drain, might rise as an undead creature of some kind.
