## Programming Nanites


Since nanites are small machines controlled by small computers, they can be programmed and reprogrammed accordingly. Reprogramming a nanocolony requires a special computer that can broadcast signals on a frequency the nanocolony recognizes; such computers require a Wealth check (purchase DC 30) to purchase and, depending on the setting, are frequently restricted by the government. Nanocolonies are programmed using the Computer Use skill as normal.


Typical commands given to a nanocolony include activation and deactivation, movement (both internal and external), as well as instructions to follow orders only from particular computers or individuals. Though hacking a nanocolony is possible, changing a nanocolony's purpose can be quite difficult. The hacker must not only overcome the nanocolony's programming, but also must find a way to use the nanite's hardware to serve a new function.
