## 
    Telepathy [MAJOR]
   



    You gain limited telepathic ability.
   



    MP Cost: 5.
   



    Benefit: As a free action, you can forge a telepathic link with another living creature within 100 feet of you. The creature with which you form the link must have an Intelligence score of 6 or higher, and it must be a willing participant in the link. You can communicate telepathically through the link even if you do not share a common language, but no special control or influence is established as a result of the link. If you and the linked creature move more than 100 feet apart, the telepathic link severs instantly. You can telepathically link with only one creature at a time during any given round, but the ability can be used at will.
