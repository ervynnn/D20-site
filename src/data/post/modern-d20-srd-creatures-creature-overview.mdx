## Creature Overview

### Creature Description

Each creature is organized in the same general format, as described in the
following text. Much of the information on a creature is condensed into a
creature statistics block, the contents of which are explained below.

### Challenge Rating (CR)

A creature’s Challenge Rating provides a rough measure of the creature’s
toughness in a combat situation. As a rule of thumb, four heroes of a level
equal to the creature’s Challenge Rating should exhaust roughly one-quarter of
their resources battling it. But situations may arise where a creature’s
Challenge Rating does not accurately reflect the difficulty of the challenge.

### Size

A creature falls into one of nine size categories. Each size category includes
a size modifier that applies to the creature’s [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) and [attack rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll); a
modifier that applies to [grapple](modern-d20-srd-combat-grapple) checks; and
a modifier that applies to [Hide](modern-d20-srd-skills-hide) checks. These
[modifiers](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) have been figured into the
statistics for the creatures described here.

### Type

A creature’s type determines many of its characteristics and abilities:
physical ability scores, Hit Die type, base attack bonus, [saving throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) bonuses, skill points,
[feats](modern-d20-srd-feats-index), and special qualities. Mental ability
scores ([Intelligence](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores),
[Wisdom](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores), and [Charisma](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)) can vary widely among creatures of a type; unless a
type description specifies a particular score for one of these abilities, the
GM will assign values as he or she deems appropriate.

### Hit Dice (HD) and Hit Points (hp)

A creature’s type and size determine its Hit Dice. A creature’s Hit Dice is
equivalent to its level for determining how various FX abilities affect the
creature, its rate of natural healing, and its maximum ranks in a skill.

A creature’s Hit Dice and [Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)
modifier determine its hit points. A creature’s entry gives the creature’s
average hit points.

### [Massive Damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-death-dying-healing) Threshold
(Mas)

When a creature takes damage from a single attack equal to or greater than its
current [Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores), it must succeed
on a [Fortitude save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) (DC 15) or
immediately drop to –1 hit points. If the damage would reduce the creature to
–1 hit points or fewer anyway, the [massive damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-death-dying-healing) threshold does not apply, and the creature does not need
to make a [Fortitude save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws).

Constructs, [elemental](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-elemental)s,
[ooze](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-ooze)s, [plant](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-plant)s, and [undead](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-undead) ignore the
effects of [massive damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-death-dying-healing) and do
not have [massive damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-death-dying-healing)
thresholds. Vermin gain a +5 species bonus on their [Fortitude saves](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) to avoid falling to –1 [hit points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points).

### Initiative (Init)

The creature’s modifier on initiative checks is usually equal to its
[Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier, although the
[Improved Initiative](modern-d20-srd-feats-improved-initiative) feat provides
an additional +4 bonus.

### Speed (Spd)

A creature’s tactical speed on land is the amount of distance it can cover in
one move action. If the creature wears armor that reduces its speed, this fact
is given along with a parenthetical note indicating the armor type; the
creature’s base unarmored speed follows.

If the creature has other modes of movement, these are given after the main
entry. Unless noted otherwise, modes of movement are natural (not magical).

Burrow: The creature can tunnel through dirt, but not through rock unless the
descriptive text says otherwise. Creatures cannot run while burrowing.

Climb: A creature with a climb speed has the [Climb](modern-d20-srd-skills-climb) skill at no cost and gains a +8 species bonus on
[Climb](modern-d20-srd-skills-climb) checks. The creature must make a
[Climb](modern-d20-srd-skills-climb) check to climb any wall or slope with a
DC greater than 0, but it always can choose to take 10, even if rushed or
threatened while climbing. The creature climbs at the given speed while
climbing. If it attempts an accelerated climb, it moves at double the given
climb speed (or its normal land speed, whichever is less) and makes a single
[Climb](modern-d20-srd-skills-climb) check at a –5 penalty. Creatures cannot
use the run action while climbing. The creature retains its
[Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) bonus to
[Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) (if any) while climbing, and
opponents get no special bonus on their [attack rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) against the climbing creature.

Fly: The creature can fly at the given speed if carrying no more than a medium
load. All fly speeds include a parenthetical note indicating maneuverability:

Perfect: The creature can perform almost any aerial maneuver it wishes.

Good: The creature is agile in the air, but cannot change direction as readily
as one with perfect maneuverability.

Average: The creature can fly as adroitly as a small bird.

Poor: The creature flies as well as a very large bird.

Clumsy: The creature can barely fly at all.

Creatures that fly can make dive attacks. A dive attack works just like a
charge, but the diving creature must move a minimum of 30 feet. It can make
only claw attacks, but these deal double damage. Creatures can use the run
action while flying, provided they fly in a straight line.

Swim: A creature with a swim speed can move through water at the given speed
without making [Swim](modern-d20-srd-skills-swim) checks. It gains a +8
species bonus on any [Swim](modern-d20-srd-skills-swim) check to perform some
special action or avoid a hazard. The creature always can choose to [take 10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index), even if distracted
or endangered when swimming. Creatures can use the run action while swimming,
provided they swim in a straight line.

### Defense

A creature’s [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) includes a parenthetical
mention of the modifiers contributing to it. The creature’s “touch” Defense
(discounting natural armor and other armor modifiers) and “flat-footed”
Defense (discounting [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) bonus
and class bonus, if any) are provided as well.

### Base Attack Bonus (BAB)

A creature’s base attack bonus does not include any modifiers. It is used to
calculate a creature’s [grapple](modern-d20-srd-combat-grapple) modifier as
well as the maximum bonus on [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) rolls for
a creature using the [Power Attack](modern-d20-srd-feats-power-attack) feat. A
creature’s base attack bonus is derived by cross-referencing the creature’s
Hit Dice and type on [Table: Creature Saves and Base Attack Bonuses](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-index).

### [Grapple](modern-d20-srd-combat-grapple) Modifier (Grap)

Whenever a creature makes an opposed [grapple](modern-d20-srd-combat-grapple)
check, apply this modifier to its d20 roll. The total modifier on
[grapple](modern-d20-srd-combat-grapple) checks is determined as follows: base
attack bonus + [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier +
[grapple](modern-d20-srd-combat-grapple) modifier. The
[grapple](modern-d20-srd-combat-grapple) modifiers for creatures of various
sizes are given in Table: Creature Sizes.

### Primary [Attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) (Atk)

If a creature moves more than 5 feet in the same round it
[attacks](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll), it makes only a single
[attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) using its primary [attack bonus](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll). This bonus includes modifications
for size and [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) (for
[melee](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) attacks) or
[Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-action-points) (for [ranged](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) attacks). A creature with the [Weapon Finesse](modern-d20-srd-feats-weapon-finesse) feat can use its
[Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-action-points) modifier on its primary
[attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll). The [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) and primary weapon type are noted in parentheses.

A creature’s primary [attack damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) includes
its full [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier (1.5 times
its Strength bonus if it is the creature’s sole attack).

Use the creature’s primary [attack bonus](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll)
whenever the creature makes an [attack of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity).

Creatures can attack with natural weapons, manufactured weapons, or sometimes
both.

### Natural Weapons

Natural weapons include teeth, claws, horns, and the like. The number of
attacks along with the weapon, [attack bonus](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll), and form of attack (melee or ranged) are provided in a creature’s
entry. Unless noted otherwise, natural weapons threaten [critical hits](modern-d20-srd-combat-critical-hits) on a natural attack roll of 20.

If any attacks also cause some special effect other than damage, that
information is given along with the damage. Unless noted otherwise, creatures
deal double damage on [critical hits](modern-d20-srd-combat-critical-hits).

Natural weapons have types just as other weapons do. The most common types are
summarized below.

Bite: The creature attacks with its mouth, dealing piercing
[damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage).

Claw or Rake: The creature rips with a sharp appendage, dealing slashing
[damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage).

Gore: The creature spears the opponent with an antler, horn, or similar
appendage, dealing piercing [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage).

Slap or Slam: The creature batters opponents with an appendage, dealing
bludgeoning [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage).

Sting: The creature stabs with a stinger, dealing piercing dam­age. Stings are
usually [poisoned](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-poison).

### Manufactured Weapons

Creatures that use manufactured weapons follow the same rules as characters,
including those for multiple attacks and two-weapon fighting penalties.

### Full Attack (Full Atk)

A creature that takes no more than a 5-foot step during its turn can make a
full attack using all of its natural weapons. A creature’s full attack
includes both its primary attack and its secondary attacks (if any).

The primary attack bonus includes modifications for size and
[Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) (for [melee](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) attacks) or [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) (for [ranged](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) attacks). A creature
with the [Weapon Finesse](modern-d20-srd-feats-weapon-finesse) feat can use
its [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier on
[melee](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) attacks. A creature’s primary
attack [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) includes its full
[Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier (1.5 times its
[Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) bonus if it is the creature’s
sole attack or if the creature is wielding a two-handed
[melee](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) weapon).

The remaining weapons are secondary attacks and take a –5 penalty on [attack rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll). Creatures with the Multiattack feat
(see Feats, below) take only a –2 penalty on secondary attacks. Secondary
attacks add only one-half the creature’s Strength bonus to the damage.

Creatures that do not normally carry ranged weapons are still given a ranged
attack bonus for situations in which they might be throwing objects at a
target.

### Fighting Space (FS)

Fighting space approximates the amount of space a creature needs to move and
fight effectively, and how much space it occupies on a grid of 5-foot-
by-5-foot squares. Table: Creature Sizes gives the fighting space for
creatures of any given size, although variations and exceptions are possible.

### Reach

A creature’s reach is the distance at which it can strike targets with its
natural weapons without needing to adjust its position on the grid. A creature
using its natural weapons threatens all squares within its reach. When
measuring diagonally, every second square counts as two squares. Table:
Creature Sizes provides the typical reach for creatures of any given size. The
GM may adjust the values in the table by –5 feet or +5 feet for creatures that
have less than normal or greater than normal reach. Unlike the wielder of a
reach weapon, a creature with greater than normal reach (more than 5 feet) can
still strike creatures next to it. A creature with greater than normal reach
usually gets an attack of opportunity against a character if the character
approaches it, because the character enters a square it threatens before he or
she can attack it. (This does not apply if the character takes a 5-foot step.)
Large or larger creatures with reach weapons can strike targets out to double
their reach but can’t strike at targets within their normal reach or less.

A creature with a 0-foot reach must move into the fighting space of its target
to attack it, provoking an [attack of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity) from the target as the creature enters the target’s
fighting space and threatened area. Also, creatures with 0-foot reach do not
threaten the squares around them.

### Special Qualities (SQ)

Many creatures have unusual abilities. A special quality can be extraordinary
(Ex), spell-like (Sp), or supernatural (Su).

Extraordinary: Extraordinary abilities are nonmagical and are not subject to
anything that disrupts magic. Using an extraordinary ability is a free action
unless noted otherwise.

Spell-Like: Spell-like abilities are magical and work just like spells, though
they have no verbal, somatic, material, focus, or XP components. They are
subject to spell resistance.

Spell-like abilities usually have a limit on the number of times they can be
used. A spell-like ability that can be used “at will” has no use limit. Using
a spell-like ability is an [attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) unless noted otherwise, and doing so while threatened provokes
[attacks of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity). A
spell-like ability can be [disrupted](modern-d20-srd-fx-interrupting-fx-users)
just as a spell can be.

For creatures with spell-like abilities, a designated caster level serves to
define how difficult it is to dispel their spell-like effects and to define
any level-dependent variable the abilities might have. The creature’s caster
level never affects which spell-like abilities the creature has; sometimes the
given caster level is lower than the level a spellcasting character would need
to cast the spell of the same name.

The saving throw (if any) for a spell-like ability is 10 + the level of the
spell the ability resembles or duplicates + the creature’s
[Charisma](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier.

Supernatural: Supernatural abilities are magical but are not subject to spell
resistance. Using a supernatural ability is an attack action unless noted
otherwise. Supernatural abilities may have a use limit or be usable at will,
just like spell-like abilities. However, supernatural abilities do not provoke
[attacks of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity) and
never require Concentration checks.

### [Allegiances](modern-d20-srd-basics-allegiances) (AL)

This entry lists the creature’s most likely [allegiances](modern-d20-srd-basics-allegiances), in order from most important to least important.
Fantastic creatures often have [allegiances](modern-d20-srd-basics-allegiances) to a moral or ethical philosophy as well as
[allegiances](modern-d20-srd-basics-allegiances) to masters, groups,
organizations, owners, or creators.

### [Saves](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) (SV)

A creature’s Fortitude, Reflex, and Will [saving throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) modifiers take into account the creature’s type, ability score
modifiers, feats, and any special qualities.

### [Action Points](modern-d20-srd-basics-action-points) (AP)

Creatures have no [action points](modern-d20-srd-basics-action-points).
However, creatures can gain action points by taking levels in a heroic
[character class](modern-d20-srd-classes-index). Every time a creature picks
up a heroic class level, it gains a number of [action points](modern-d20-srd-basics-action-points) equal to 5 + one-half its heroic character level (not
counting the creature’s starting Hit Dice). Like most heroic characters,
however, creatures with heroic class levels will have spent a certain number
of [action points](modern-d20-srd-basics-action-points) in the course of their
“heroic” careers.

Assume that a creature has a number of [action points](modern-d20-srd-basics-action-points) remaining equal to one-half of its heroic class levels.

### Reputation (Rep)

A creature has a [Reputation](modern-d20-srd-reputation-index) bonus of +0 but
may increase the bonus by taking levels in a character class.

### [Abilities](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)

Creatures have the same six [ability scores](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) as characters: [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) (Str),
[Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) (Dex),
[Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) (Con),
[Intelligence](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) (Int),
[Wisdom](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) (Wis),
[Charisma](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) (Cha). Exceptions are noted
below.

Strength: Quadrupeds can carry heavier loads than bipedal characters. See
[Carrying Capacity](modern-d20-srd-equipment-carrying-capacity).

[Intelligence](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores): A creature can speak all
the languages mentioned in its descriptive text. Any creature with an
[Intelligence](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) score of 3 or higher
understands at least one language.

Nonabilities: Some creatures lack certain ability scores. These creatures do
not have an ability score of 0—they lack the ability altogether. The modifier
for a nonability is +0. Other effects of nonabilities are as follows:

[Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores): Any creature that can
physically manipulate other objects has at least 1 point of
[Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores). A creature with no
[Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) score can’t exert force,
usually because it has no physical body or because it is immobile. The
creature automatically fails [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)
checks. If the [creature](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) can attack, it
applies its [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier to its
base [attack bonus](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) instead of a
[Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier.

[Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores): Any creature that can move
has at least 1 point of [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores). A
creature with no [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) score can’t
move. If it can act (such as by casting spells), the creature applies its
[Intelligence](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier instead of its
[Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier to
[initiative](modern-d20-srd-combat-initiative) checks. The creature fails all
[Reflex saves](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) and
[Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) checks.

[Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores): Any living creature has
at least 1 point of [Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores). A
creature with no [Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) has no
body or no metabolism. It is immune to any effect that requires a [Fortitude save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) unless the effect works on objects
or is harmless. The creature is also immune to ability damage, ability drain,
and [energy drain](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-energy-drain), and it
always fails [Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) checks.

[Intelligence](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores): Any creature that can
think, learn, or remember has at least 1 point of
[Intelligence](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores). A creature with no
[Intelligence](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) score is an automaton,
operating on simple instincts or programmed instructions. It is immune to all
mind-affecting effects and automatically fails [Intelligence](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) checks.

[Wisdom](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores): Any creature that can perceive
its environment in any fashion has at least 1 point of
[Wisdom](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores). Anything with no
[Wisdom](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) score is an object, not a
creature. Anything without a [Wisdom](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)
score also has no [Charisma](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) score.

[Charisma](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores): Any creature capable of
telling the difference between itself and things that are not itself has at
least 1 point of [Charisma](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores). Anything
with no [Charisma](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) score is an object,
not a creature. Anything without a [Charisma](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) score also has no [Wisdom](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)
score.

### [Skills](modern-d20-srd-skills-index)

This section lists alphabetically all the creature’s skills by name along with
skill modifiers that include adjustments for ability scores and any bonuses
from feats or species abilities (unless otherwise noted in the descriptive
text). All listed skills were purchased as class skills unless the creature
acquires a character class (see Advancement, below).

Automatic Languages: Some creatures read, write, or speak unique languages
that heroes don’t know anything about. The GM determines whether a hero is
capable of learning one of these unique languages and the method by which that
language can be learned.

### [Feats](modern-d20-srd-feats-index)

This section lists alphabetically all the creature’s feats.

Most creatures use the same feats that are available to characters, but some
have access to the Multiattack feat (described below).

### Multiattack

The creature is adept at using all its natural weapons at once.

Prerequisite: Three or more natural weapons.

Benefit: The creature’s secondary attacks with natural weapons take only a –2
penalty.

Normal: Without this feat, the creature’s secondary natural attacks take a –5
penalty.

### Advancement

The GM can improve a creature by increasing its Hit Dice. The Advancement
entry indicates the increased Hit Dice (and often size) of the creature or
indicates that the creature can advance by character class.

### Increasing Hit Dice

As a creature gains Hit Dice, many of its game statistics change.

Size: Adding Hit Dice to a creature can also increase its size. An increase in
size affects a creature’s [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense), [attack rolls,](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) and [grapple](modern-d20-srd-combat-grapple) checks, as shown on Table: Creature Sizes, as well as physical
ability scores and damage, as shown in the descriptions of the creature types.

[Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense): An increase in size affects a
creature’s [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense), as shown on Table:
Creature Sizes. An increase in size might also improve a creature’s natural
armor bonus to [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense), as shown on Table:
Adjustments to Physical Abilities and Natural Armor. Note that a natural armor
bonus stacks with an equipment bonus from armor.

[Attack Bonus](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll): [Table: Creature Saves and Base Attack Bonuses](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-index) shows how a
creature’s base attack bonus improves as it gains Hit Dice. A change in the
creature’s size also modifies its [attack rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll), as shown on Table: Creature Sizes. Both values must be counted when
recalculating a creature’s attack bonus.

[Grapple](modern-d20-srd-combat-grapple) Modifier: An increase in size affects
a creature’s [grapple](modern-d20-srd-combat-grapple) modifier, as shown on
Table: Creature Sizes.

Damage: An increase in size also increases the amount of damage a creature
deals with its natural weapons.

[Saving Throws](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): [Table: Creature Saves and Base Attack Bonuses](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-index) shows how a
creature’s saving throw bonuses improve as it gains Hit Dice.

Ability Scores: An increase in size affects a creature’s
[Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores), [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores), and [Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores), as shown on Table: Adjustments to Physical Abilities and Natural
Armor.

[Skills](modern-d20-srd-skills-index) and [Feats](modern-d20-srd-feats-index):

may gain additional skill points and feats depending on its type.

### Acquiring a Character Class

A creature that acquires a character class follows the rules for multiclass
characters. The creature’s character level equals its Hit Dice plus the number
of character class levels it has. Creatures with 1 or fewer Hit Dice count
only their character class levels.

Size: Adding character classes to a creature never affects its size.

[Skills](modern-d20-srd-skills-index): Creatures that take levels of a
character class do not gain as many skill points as a human character of the
same class. Creatures get 4 fewer skill points at 1st level than a human
character and 1 fewer skill point each level thereafter; see Table: Skill
Points per Class Level for Nonhumans.

[Feats](modern-d20-srd-feats-index): Creatures with 1 or fewer Hit Dice that
acquire character class levels advance as human characters do, but they gain
only one bonus feat at 1st level instead of two.

### Talents and Abilities

Creatures that advance by character class gain special talents and abilities,
which are noted here.
