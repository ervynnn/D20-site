## 
     Bluff (Cha)
    



     You can use the Bluff skill to feint in starship combat.
    



     Check: With a successful Bluff check, you mislead another starship so that it can't dodge your attack effectively. This check is opposed by the target pilot's Sense Motive check. If you succeed, the next attack your starship makes against the target ignores its pilot's Dexterity bonus to Defense (if it has one), thus lowering the target's Defense score.
    



     You cannot use this tactic against a starship that's flying on autopilot.
    



     Using Bluff as a feint in starship combat is an attack action.
    



     Special: If you have the Starship Feint feat, you gain a +2 bonus on Bluff checks when using the skill to feint in starship combat.
