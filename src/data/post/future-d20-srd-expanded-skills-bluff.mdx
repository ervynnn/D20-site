     Bluff (Cha)




     You can use the Bluff skill to feint in starship combat.




     Check: With a successful Bluff check, you mislead another starship so that it cant dodge your attack effectively. This check is opposed by the target pilots Sense Motive check. If you succeed, the next attack your starship makes against the target ignores its pilots Dexterity bonus to Defense (if it has one), thus lowering the targets Defense score.




     You cannot use this tactic against a starship thats flying on autopilot.




     Using Bluff as a feint in starship combat is an attack action.




     Special: If you have the Starship Feint feat, you gain a +2 bonus on Bluff checks when using the skill to feint in starship combat.
