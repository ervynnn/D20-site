## Wall Walk

Transmutation

An improved version of the spider climb spell, wall walk allows for faster, easier movement. The subject can travel on vertical surfaces or ceilings as well as they can walk on the ground. No matter how smooth the wall, the subject of a wall walk spell can run up it or even fight from a sideways position, never needing to make Climb checks to do so. The subject can switch from floor to walls to ceilings as many times as his speed allows.

Unlike the spider climb spell, wall walk doesnt require the subject to use his hands to climb, so the subject can hold items and wield weapons normally.

Material Component: A black strip of Velcro.
