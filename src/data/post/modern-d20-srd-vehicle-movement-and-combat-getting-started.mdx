## Getting Started


Most [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) can be entered with a [move
  action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions) and started with a second [move
  action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions).  An exception is noted in a [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) description when it applies.


[Initiative](modern-d20-srd-combat-initiative)


There are two options for determining [initiative](modern-d20-srd-combat-initiative) in vehicle combat. First, is individual [initiative](modern-d20-srd-combat-initiative) just as in normal [combat](modern-d20-srd-combat-combat-cycle), where each character rolls separately. This is probably the best method if most or all characters are aboard the same [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles), but it can result in a lot of [delayed](modern-d20-srd-combat-special-initiative-actions) or [readied
  actions](modern-d20-srd-combat-special-initiative-actions) as passengers wait for drivers to perform [maneuvers](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-simple-maneuvers). An alternative is to roll [initiative](modern-d20-srd-combat-initiative) for each [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles), using the [vehicles initiative modifier](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles). This is particularly appropriate when characters are in separate [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles), since it allows everyone aboard the same [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) to act more or less simultaneously.
