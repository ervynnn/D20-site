##  Selling Stuff

To sell something, a character first needs to determine its sale value.
Assuming the [ object ](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-general) is
undamaged and in working condition, the sale value is equal to the [ object’s](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-general) purchase DC (as if purchased
new) minus 3.

Selling an [ object ](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-general) can provide
an increase to a character’s [ Wealth bonus ](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus) . The increase is the same amount as the [ Wealth bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus) loss the character would experience if
the character purchased an [ object ](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-general) with a purchase DC equal to the sale value.

Regardless of the character’s current [ Wealth bonus ](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus) , he or she gains a [ Wealth bonus ](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus) increase of 1 whenever the character sells an [ object](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-general) with a sale value of 15 or
higher. If a character sells an object with a sale value less than or equal to
his or her current [ Wealth bonus ](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus) , and
that sale value is 14 or lower, the character gains nothing.

A character cannot legally sell [ restricted objects ](modern-d20-srd-equipment-restricted-objects) unless the character is licensed to own them. A
character also cannot legally sell [ objects ](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-general) that have been reported as stolen. Selling [ objects](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-general) illegally usually requires that
the character have contacts in the black market, and reduces the sale value by
an additional 3. Selling takes a number of hours equal to the normal purchase
DC of the item.
