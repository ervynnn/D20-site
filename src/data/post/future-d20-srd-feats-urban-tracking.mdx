## Urban Tracking


You can track down the location of missing persons or wanted individuals.


Benefit: To find the trail of an individual or to follow it for 1 hour requires a Gather Information check. You must make another Gather Information check every hour of the search, as well as each time the trail becomes difficult to follow, such as when it moves to a different area of town.


The DC of the check, and the number of checks required to track down your quarry, depends on the community population and the conditions:


| Population | DC | Checks Required |
| :------------ | :----: | -----------------: |
| Fewer than 2,000 | 5 | 1d4 |
| 2,000'9,999 | 10 | 1d4+1 |
| 10,000'49,999 | 15 | 2d4 |
| 50,000'99,999 | 20 | 2d4+1 |
| 100,000'499,999 | 25 | 3d4 |
| 500,000+ | 30 | 3d4+1 |



| Condition | DC Modifier |
| :----------- | -------------: |
| Every three creatures in the group being sought | '1 |
| Every 24 hours the quarry has been missing or sought | +1 |
| Tracked quarry lies low | +5 |



If you fail a Gather Information check, you can retry after 1 hour of questioning. The GM rolls the number of checks required secretly, so the player doesn't know exactly how long the task requires.


Normal: A character without this feat can use Gather Information to find out information about a particular individual, but each check takes 1d4+1 hours and doesn't allow effective trailing.


Special: You can cut the time per Gather Information check in half (to 30 minutes per check rather than 1 hour per check), but you suffer a '5 penalty on the check.
