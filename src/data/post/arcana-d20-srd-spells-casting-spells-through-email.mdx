## Casting Spells through Email

Any spell that can be scribed onto a scroll can likewise be saved in electronic formatas email. In order to accomplish this, the caster must have the Scribe Scroll ability and a minimum of 8 ranks in Computer Use.

All the spellcaster needs is a computer with Internet access and the usual components necessary to cast the spell. First she writes the email, which takes one minute per level of the spell. At the end of that time, the spellcaster must cast the spell and succeed at a Computer Use check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the email is not correctly typed, the spell is ruined, and the spellcaster must begin anew. If the check succeeds, the email carries the spell through cyberspace and delivers it to the mailbox of the target.

A spellcaster casting a spell through email must expend XP as if scribing a scroll.

There are several rules and restrictions pertaining to spells sent through email:

Target: The target of the spell is always the person who first opens the email. Any target with 10 or more ranks in Computer Use, Knowledge (arcane lore or technology), or Spellcraft receives a +5 competence bonus to any saving throws required by the spell.

No Spam: The email may only be sent to a single account. If you put more than one address in the Recipient line, the spell is ruined and wasted.

Subject Line: The spells name must be typed into the Subject line of the email. One can attempt to disguise the name by writing it in an obscure language, an illegible font, or burying it in the middle of a larger phrase.

Duration: All spells begin immediately upon the email being opened. It is not possible for a spellcaster to save the power from an email spell and discharge it later.

Undeliverable: If the email is not opened within 72 hours, it becomes undeliverable. The account that sent the original email will receive an email notification of this. If the target opens the email after 72 hours have elapsed, the body of the message will be blank.
