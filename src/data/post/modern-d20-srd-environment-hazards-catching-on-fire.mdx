## Catching on Fire




    Heroes exposed to open flames might find their clothes, hair, or equipment on fire. Heroes at risk of catching fire are allowed a Reflex
    [saving  throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
(DC 15) to avoid this fate. If a hero’s clothes or hair catch fire, he or she takes 1d6 points of
[damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
immediately. In each subsequent round, the burning hero must make another Reflex
[saving throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
. Failure means he or she takes another 1d6 points of
[damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
that round. Success means that the fire has gone out. (That is, once the character succeeds at the
[saving throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
, he or she is no longer on fire.)

    A hero on fire may automatically extinguish the flames by jumping into enough water to douse him or herself. If no body of water is at hand, rolling on the ground or smothering the fire with blankets or the like permits the hero another
