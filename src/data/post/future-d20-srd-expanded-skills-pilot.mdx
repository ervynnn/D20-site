## 
     Pilot (Dex)
    



     You can use the Pilot skill to fly any kind of spacecraft.
    



     Check: Unless you have the Starship Operation feat (page 14), you take a '4 penalty on Pilot checks made to pilot a starship. The pilot of a starship can make a Pilot check to escape after being held or immobilized by another starship's grapplers or tractor beam; see Grappling Systems for more information on grapplers and tractor beams.
    



     Special: For modern-day (PL 5) spacecraft such as the space shuttle, the Aircraft Operation (spacecraft) is sufficient to negate the '4 penalty on Pilot checks; however, this feat cannot negate the penalty as it applies to PL 6 or higher spacecraft.
