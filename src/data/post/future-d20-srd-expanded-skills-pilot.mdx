     Pilot (Dex)




     You can use the Pilot skill to fly any kind of spacecraft.




     Check: Unless you have the Starship Operation feat (page 14), you take a 4 penalty on Pilot checks made to pilot a starship. The pilot of a starship can make a Pilot check to escape after being held or immobilized by another starships grapplers or tractor beam; see Grappling Systems for more information on grapplers and tractor beams.




     Special: For modern-day (PL 5) spacecraft such as the space shuttle, the Aircraft Operation (spacecraft) is sufficient to negate the 4 penalty on Pilot checks; however, this feat cannot negate the penalty as it applies to PL 6 or higher spacecraft.
