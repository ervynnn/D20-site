## 
     Multiple Use Item
    



     Similar in function to the alternate weapon gadget, the multiple use item gadget allows the character to integrate the function of two separate items into a single device.
    



     When selecting the multiple use item gadget, choose a second object. That object is integrated into the base object and can be used at any time.
    



     Additionally, you must choose whether or not the alternate object may be physically separated from the base weapon or not at the time of purchase. This gadget may be selected multiple times, each time adding a single additional piece of equipment to the base object.
    




      Restrictions
     
     : The character must also purchase the piece of equipment to be integrated separately from the armor, before the gadget modification is made.
