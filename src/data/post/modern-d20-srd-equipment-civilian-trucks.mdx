Trucks include pickups, sport utility vehicles, vans, and minivans. They
generally have the same features as civilian cars.

Like cars, trucks generally provide three-quarters [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover) to their occupants. The rear bed of a pickup truck, however,
provides only one-half [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover).

### AM General Hummer

The four-door Hummer is a civilian version of the military’s all-terrain
“humvee” utility vehicle. It comes equipped with a powerful 6.5-liter,
195-horsepower V8 turbo diesel engine. The hummer is decked out like a luxury
vehicle inside, but this vehicle is every bit as rugged as the military
version.

The military version can be configured in a variety of ways, including a two-
door pickup, a four-door pickup with a short bed, and a completely enclosed,
SUV-like body with a hatchback and four doors. It lacks the luxury accessories
of the civilian version, but it is equipped with puncture-resistant tires.

A Hummer is two squares wide and four squares long.

### Chevrolet Suburban

One of the largest sport utility vans on the market, the Suburban is a four-
door truck equipped with a standard 6.0-liter, 320-horsepower V8 engine. It is
two squares wide and four squares long.

### Dodge Caravan

The Caravan is a minivan with two conventional doors up front, sliding doors
on the side, and a rear hatch-style door. It is two squares wide and four
squares long.

### Ford Escape XLT

The Escape is a four-door SUV with a 3.0-liter, 201-horsepower V6 engine. It
is two squares wide and three squares long.

### Ford F-150 XL

This two-door pickup truck has a 4.2-liter, 202-horsepower V6 engine. The
F-150 is two squares wide and four squares long.

### Toyota Tacoma Xtracab

The Tacoma is a two-door pickup with a back seat in its extended cab. It is
two squares wide and four squares long.
