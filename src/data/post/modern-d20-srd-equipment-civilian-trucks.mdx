Trucks include pickups, sport utility vehicles, vans, and minivans. They generally have the same features as civilian cars.


Like cars, trucks generally provide three-quarters [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover) to their occupants. The rear bed of a pickup truck, however, provides only one-half [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover).


### AM General Hummer


The four-door Hummer is a civilian version of the militarys all-terrain humvee utility vehicle. It comes equipped with a powerful 6.5-liter, 195-horsepower V8 turbo diesel engine. The hummer is decked out like a luxury vehicle inside, but this vehicle is every bit as rugged as the military version.


The military version can be configured in a variety of ways, including a two-door
  pickup, a four-door pickup with a short bed, and a completely enclosed, SUV-like
  body with a hatchback and four doors. It lacks the luxury accessories of the
  civilian version, but it is equipped with puncture-resistant tires.


A Hummer is two squares wide and four squares long.


### Chevrolet Suburban


One of the largest sport utility vans on the market, the Suburban is a four-door truck equipped with a standard 6.0-liter, 320-horsepower V8 engine. It is two squares wide and four squares long.


### Dodge Caravan


The Caravan is a minivan with two conventional doors up front, sliding doors on the side, and a rear hatch-style door. It is two squares wide and four squares long.


### Ford Escape XLT


The Escape is a four-door SUV with a 3.0-liter, 201-horsepower V6 engine. It is two squares wide and three squares long.


### Ford F-150 XL


This two-door pickup truck has a 4.2-liter, 202-horsepower V6 engine. The F-150 is two squares wide and four squares long.


### Toyota Tacoma Xtracab


The Tacoma is a two-door pickup with a back seat in its extended cab. It is two squares wide and four squares long.
