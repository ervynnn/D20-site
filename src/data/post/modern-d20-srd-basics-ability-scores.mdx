## Ability Scores

Every character has six basic Ability Scores:

Strength (STR)

Dexterity (DEX)

Constitution (CON)

Intelligence (INT)

Wisdom (WIS)

Charisma (CHA)

The Score of these Abilities ranges from 0 to infinity. A limit, if any, will
be specified in the rules. The normal human range is 3 to 18. It is possible
for a creature to have a score of "none". A score of "none" is not the same as
a score of "0". A score of "none" means that the creature does not possess the
ability at all. The modifier for a score of "none" is +0.

A character with a CON of 0 is dead. A 0 in any other score means the
character is helpless and cannot move. Keeping track of negative ability score
points is never necessary. A character’s ability score can’t drop below 0.

Each ability will have a modifier. The modifier can be calculated using this
formula:  
(ability/2) -5 [round result down]

The modifier is the number you add to or subtract from the die roll when your
character tries to do something related to that ability. A positive modifier
is called a bonus, and a negative modifier is called a penalty.

### Use Of Ability Scores

### Strength

Any creature that can physically manipulate other objects has at least 1 point
of Strength.

A creature with no Strength score can't exert force, usually because it has no
physical body or because it doesn't move. The creature automatically fails
Strength checks. If the creature can attack, it applies its Dexterity modifier
to its base attack instead of a Strength modifier.

### Dexterity

Any creature that can move has at least 1 point of Dexterity.

A creature with no Dexterity score can't move. If it can act, it applies its
Intelligence modifier to initiative checks instead of a Dexterity modifier.
The creature fails all Reflex saves and Dexterity checks.

### Constitution

If a character's Constitution changes enough to alter his or her Constitution
modifier, his or her hit points also increase or decrease accordingly at the
same time.

Any living creature has at least 1 point of Constitution.

A creature with no Constitution has no body or no metabolism. It is immune to
any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless the effect works on objects.
The creature is also immune to ability damage, ability drain, energy drain,
and massive damage, and always fails Constitution checks.

### Intelligence

Any creature that can think, learn, or remember has at least 1 point of
Intelligence.

A creature with no Intelligence score is an automaton, operating on simple
instincts or programmed instructions. It is immune to all mind-influencing
effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns and morale effects) and
automatically fails Intelligence checks.

### Wisdom

Any creature that can perceive its environment in any fashion has at least 1
point of Wisdom.

Anything with no Wisdom score is an object, not a creature. Anything without a
Wisdom score also has no Charisma score, and vice versa.

### Charisma

Any creature capable of telling the difference between itself and things that
are not itself has at least 1 point of Charisma.

### Ability Checks

Sometimes a character tries to do something to which no specific skill
applies. In these cases, the character makes an ability check: Roll 1d20 and
apply the appropriate ability modifier. The GM assigns a DC, or sets up an
opposed check when two characters are engaged in a contest using one ability
against another. In some cases, a test of one’s ability doesn’t involve luck.
When two characters arm wrestle, for example, the stronger character simply
wins. In the case of identical scores, make opposed Strength checks.


<table> <tr> <th>Example Ability Check</th> <th>Key Ability</th> </tr> <tr> <td> Forcing open a jammed or locked door</td> <td> Strength </td> </tr> <tr class="shaded"> <td> Tying a rope</td> <td> Dexterity </td> </tr> <tr> <td> Holding one’s breath</td> <td> Constitution </td> </tr> <tr class="shaded"> <td> Navigating a maze</td> <td> Intelligence </td> </tr> <tr> <td> Recognize a stranger you’ve seen before</td> <td> Wisdom </td> </tr> <tr class="shaded"> <td> Getting yourself noticed in a crowd</td> <td> Charisma </td> </tr> </table>


### Changing Ability Scores

Ability scores can increase with no limit.

Poisons, diseases, and other effects can cause temporary ability damage.
Ability points lost to damage return naturally, typically at a rate of 1 point
per day for each affected ability.

As a character ages, some ability scores go up and others go down.

When an ability score changes, the modifier associated with that score also
changes.
