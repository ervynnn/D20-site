### A3X Dragon Flame-Thrower (PL 5)


Used primarily against soft, unarmored targets, the A3X Dragon flame-thrower sprays a 30-foot cone of burning liquid fuel. Anyone caught within the cone must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 13) or take 4d6 points of fire damage. The flame-thrower carries enough fuel for 20 attacks; refueling the tank has a purchase DC of 12.



Equipment Slots: 1.
Activation: Attack action.
Range Increment: Emanates from mecha.
Area: 30-foot cone.
Duration: Instantaneous.
Saving Throw: Reflex half (DC 13).
Purchase DC: 21.
Restriction: Military (+3).



### M-9 Barrage Chaingun (PL 5)


Essentially a high-tech version of the medium machinegun, the M-9 Barrage has multiple barrels that fire large-caliber ammunition, dealing 5d6 points of ballistic damage on a successful hit. The base unit has enough room for four 50-round ammo belts. Each additional equipment slot devoted to ammo storage has room for six more ammo belts. Each additional ammo belt has a purchase DC of 8.



Equipment Slots: 1, must be hand (or arm if Large), arm, or shoulders.
Activation: Attack action.
Range Increment: 60 feet.
Target: Single target within 600 feet, or autofire.
Duration: Instantaneous.
Saving Throw: None.
Purchase DC: 21.
Restriction: Restricted (+2).



### M-53 Firestar Rocket Launcher (PL 5)


M-53 Firestar rocket launchers fire self-guided incendiary-tipped rockets at any point within range. When the rocket reaches the designated target pointwhich can be a point in mid-airit explodes, dealing 10d6 points of fire damage to everything within its burst radius. A successful Reflex save (DC 17) reduces the damage by half. The system carries six rockets.



Equipment Slots: 1 for launcher, must be hand (or arm if Large), arm, or shoulders; 1 for each six-rocket pack.
Activation: Attack action.
Range: 200 feet.
Area: 20-foot-radius burst.
Duration: Instantaneous.
Saving Throw: Reflex half (DC 17).
Purchase DC: 24 for rocket launcher and 6 rockets, 12 per additional 6-rocket pack.
Restriction: Military (+3).



### M-55 Crud Rocket Launcher (PL 5)


The M-55 Crud rocket launcher is similar to the M-53 Firestar rocket launcher. M-55 Crud shells release high-velocity shrapnel that deals 10d6 points of slashing damage to everything within its burst radius. A successful Reflex save (DC 17) reduces the damage by half.


### M-87 Talon Missile Launcher (PL 5)


The most common missile launcher installed on mecha, the M-87 Talon deals 15d6 points of damage to its target; half of the damage is ballistic damage, and half of the damage is fire damage. The missile's guidance system negates the normal penalty for range increments.



Equipment Slots: 1 for launcher, must be hand (or arm if Large), arm, or shoulders; 1 for each 4-missile battery.
Activation: Attack action.
Range: 2,000 feet.
Target: Single target.
Duration: Instantaneous.
Saving Throw: None.
Purchase DC: 23 for missile launcher and 4 missiles, 21 per additional 4-missile pack.
Restriction: Military (+3).



### PS-15 Panther Claws (PL 5)


A mecha equipped with these durable alloy claws can tear great rents in most metal plating. The claws can be extended or retracted as a free action.
The claws convert the mecha's slam attack into a claw attack that deals slashing damage. The amount of damage is based on the mecha's size: Large 2d6, Huge 2d8, Gargantuan 4d6, and Colossal 4d10. The claws have a critical threat range of 19'20.


The claws are one size category smaller than the mecha's size category.



Equipment Slots: 1, must be hand (or arm if Large).
Activation: Attack action.
Range: Touch.
Target: Single target within reach.
Duration: Instantaneous.
Saving Throw: None.
Purchase DC: 10 + one-quarter the mecha's base purchase DC.
Restriction: None.



### Thunderbolt Shock Rod (PL 5)


The Thunderbolt shock rod is essentially a one-handed metal rod with an electrical current running through the end. Damage is determined by the size of the mecha wielding it: Large 6d6, Huge 8d6, Gargantuan 10d6, and Colossal 12d6. Half of the damage is bludgeoning damage, and half is electricity damage.


The shock rod's size category is the same as the mecha's size category.



Equipment Slots: 1, must be hand (or arm if Large).
Activation: Attack action.
Range: Touch.
Target: Single target within reach.
Duration: Instantaneous.
Saving Throw: None.
Purchase DC: 10 + one-quarter the mecha's base purchase DC.
Restriction: None.



### Warpath Recoilless Rifle (PL 5)


The Warpath recoilless rifle is a rapid-fire cannon that fires shells that detonate on impact. Each shell deals 10d6 points of damage, and the system's magazine holds 20 shells.



Equipment Slots: 1 for rifle, must be hand (or arm if Large); 1 for each 20-round magazine.
Activation: Attack action.
Range Increment: 40 feet.
Target: Single target within 400 feet, or autofire.
Duration: Instantaneous.
Saving Throw: None.
Purchase DC : 22 for rifle and 20-round magazine, 15 per additional magazine.
Restriction: Military (+3).
