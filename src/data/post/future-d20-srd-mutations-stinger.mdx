## Stinger [MAJOR]


A poisonous stinger erupts from some part of your bodyÂ—usually a needlelike barb protruding from an arm or leg joint, or a scorpionlike stinger on the end of a tail or similar appendage.


MP Cost: 4.


Benefit: Your sharp stinger deals piercing damage dependent on your size: Small 1d4, Medium-size 1d6, Large 1d8. If you get multiple attacks in a round, you can sting multiple times. The stinger is treated as a natural weapon and does not provoke attacks of opportunity. In addition, the stinger injects poison into the target, with effects similar to puffer poison.


Special: This mutation can be used in conjunction with the Tail mutation, but the tail cannot be used as a bludgeoning weapon during the same round the stinger is used.
