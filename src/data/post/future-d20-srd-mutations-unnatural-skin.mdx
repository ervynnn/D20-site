## 
    Unnatural Skin [COSMETIC]
   



    The color of your skin or exoskeleton changes drastically, assuming a hue or texture that is both unnatural and atypical of your species. Your skin might be a single color, splotched, or patterned in some freakishly unnatural way. Your skin might gain dynamic pigments that change color based on outside stimuli, such as exposure to ultraviolet light.
