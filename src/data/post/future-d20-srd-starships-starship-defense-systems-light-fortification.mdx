## Light Fortification (PL 7)


The starshipâ€™s structural integrity is reinforced so that the ship can shake off attacks that would cripple it otherwise. Light fortification converts 25% of all critical hits into regular hits.


Installing light fortification requires a Craft (structural) check instead of a Craft (mechanical) check.


Purchase DC: 10 + one-half the base purchase DC of the starship.


Restriction: Licensed (+1).
