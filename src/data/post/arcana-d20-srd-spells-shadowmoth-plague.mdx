## Shadowmoth Plague

Conjuration (Summoning)

Level: Divine 3; Components: V, S, DF; Casting Time: Fullround action; Range: Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level); Effect: 5- ft.-high cloud of shadowmoths filling a 10-ft.-radius spread; Duration: 1 minute/level; Saving Throw: None; Spell Resistance: No

You summon a number of shadowmoth swarms, each of which attacks any creature occupying its square. Each square of the spells effect is filled with a swarm of shadowmoths, to a maximum of 12 swarms, assuming that the spells effect isnt blocked by obstacles. The swarms are stationary after being summoned, and wont pursue creatures that flee.
