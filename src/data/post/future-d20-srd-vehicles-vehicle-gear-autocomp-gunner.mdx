## Autocomp, Gunner


A gunner autocomp is an onboard computer with AI software capable of automatically aiming and firing all of a vehicle's mounted weapons, thereby removing the need for one or more gunners. Most vehicles equipped with a gunner autocomp still allow the vehicle's weapons to be controlled manually if the autocomp is deactivated or disabled. Disabling a gunner autocomp requires a successful Disable Device check (DC 15).


The gunner autocomp's attack bonus, as well as its purchase DC, depends on the quality of the system's AI software; see Table: Gunner Autocomps for details.
Purchase DC: See Table, and increase the purchase DC by +1 for each additional weapon after the first. Restriction: Licensed (+1).
