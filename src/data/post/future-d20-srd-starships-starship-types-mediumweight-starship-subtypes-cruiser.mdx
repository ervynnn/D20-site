## Cruiser (PL 6)


The cruiser is a warship that serves several roles. It may be part of a task force, escorting capital ships or laying mines. It may operate independently as a scout and raider. Conversely, it may serve in diplomatic and scientific tasks. Light cruisers frequently have outstanding endurance and can operate with little or no resupply for months on end. A cruiser hull could serve equally well as an escort carrier or assault transport.
