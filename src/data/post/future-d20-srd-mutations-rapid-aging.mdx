## 
    Rapid Aging [DRAWBACK]
   



    You age at an increased rate due to the strain your mutations place on your cells. You appear many years older than your actual age.
   



    MP Value: 2.
   



    Drawback: Double your actual age to get your effective age. Your effective age determines your ability score penalties. You do not gain any of the benefits of aging (increased mental ability scores).
