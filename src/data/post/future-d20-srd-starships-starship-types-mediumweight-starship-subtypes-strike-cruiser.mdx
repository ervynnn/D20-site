## 
     Strike Cruiser (PL 7)
    



     These armored cruisers often serve as the centerpiece of raiding or patrolling task forces, especially if heavier warships are unavailable. Many strike cruisers are configured for task force command functions; the command cruiser is a common variant of this hull type. A strike cruiser hull could easily serve as a light carrier or assault carrier.
