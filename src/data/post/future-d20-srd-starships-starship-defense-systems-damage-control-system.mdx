## 
    Damage Control System (PL 5)
   



    A starship equipped with a damage control system can perform damage control as a move action. With a successful Repair check (DC 15), the ship regains a number of hit points depending on its type, as shown on Table: Damage Control Systems. Damage control cannot be performed if the ship has been reduced to negative hit points.
   



    Purchase DC: Varies by starship type (see Table: Damage Control Systems).
   



    Restriction: None.
