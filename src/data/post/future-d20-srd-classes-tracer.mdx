### Class Features


The following class features pertain to the Tracer advanced class.


Target Species
At 1st level, a Tracer selects a species or specific kind of creature his "target species". The Tracer must have previously encountered at least one member of the target species to select it. An expert tracker, the Tracer gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Intimidate, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against members of the target species. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such creatures.


As a free action, a Tracer may spend an action point to change his target species.


Urban Tracking
At 1st level, a Tracer gains the bonus feat Urban Tracking.


Swift Strike
At 2nd level, the Tracer becomes skilled at taking down unwary targets quickly. He deals +1d6 points of damage on successful melee and ranged weapon attacks made against a flat-footed opponent. This extra damage can be lethal or nonlethal, as determined by the choice of weapon and the manner in which it's used.


The extra damage increases to +2d6 at 5th level and +3d6 at 8th level.


Bonus Feats
At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Tracer gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Tracer must meet all the prerequisites of the feat to select it.


Advanced Combat Martial Arts, Advanced Firearms Proficiency, Aircraft Operation (spacecraft), Alertness, Armor Proficiency (light), Armor Proficiency (medium), Armor Proficiency (powered), Athletic, Combat Throw, Dead Aim, Double Tap, Elusive Target, Far Shot, Improved Combat Martial Arts, Improved Combat Throw, Improved Initiative, Low Profile, Nerve Pinch, Precise Shot, Shot on the Run, Skip Shot, Spacer, Stealthy, Trustworthy, Unbalance Opponent.


Uncanny Stealth
Tracers learn to move quickly yet quietly.


At 4th level, a Tracer no longer suffers the '5 penalty on Hide and Move Silently checks while moving at full speed.
At 7th level, a Tracer suffers only a '10 penalty on Hide and Move Silently checks while running or charging (instead of the normal '20 penalty).


Swift Tracking
At 10th level, the Tracer can move a full speed without penalty when using the Survival skill to track. He can move at twice normal speed while tracking, but takes a '10 penalty on the check when doing so.
