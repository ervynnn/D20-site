     Grimlock

###

     Species Traits




     Automatic Language: A grimlock can speak (but not read or write) one local surface language.




     Blindsight (Ex): A grimlock is blind but can ascertain all creatures and objects within 40 feet just as a sighted creature would. Beyond that range, all targets have total concealment with respect to the grimlock.




     Grimlocks are affected normally by loud noises and sonic spells (such as shout or silence) and overpowering odors (such as a troglodytes stench or incense-thick air). Negating a grimlocks sense of either smell or hearing denies it the benefits of blindsight, but the grimlock still functions as though it had the Blind-Fight feat. If both smell and hearing are negated, the grimlock is effectively blind.




     Immunities (Ex): A grimlock is immune to gaze attacks, visual effects, illusions, and all other attack forms that rely on sight.




     Scent (Ex): This ability allows a grimlock to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.




     Skill Bonus: A grimlocks dull gray skin helps it hide in its native terrain, conferring a +10 species bonus on Hide checks in rocky terrain or underground.
