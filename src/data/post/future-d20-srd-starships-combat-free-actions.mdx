[Future D20 SRD]( / ) > Starships




## Free Actions


A starship can perform multiple free actions during its turn, subject to the GM's approval. In general, if one or more free actions take longer than 6 seconds to complete, they are not free actions. Free actions include communicating via a comm system and turning.


### Communicate Via Comm System


Starships (and their crews) can communicate and coordinate with each other as a free action. A GM may rule that a particularly long or complex message cannot be communicated as a free action.


### Turn


Starshipseven immensely large onesare highly maneuverable in space. As a free action, a ship can adjust its orientation on the battle grid by pivoting or turning. The direction a starship is facing has no bearing on combat, since its weapons can be trained to fire in any direction.
