[Index](-index) > [Modern d20 SRD](modern-d20-srd-index) > [Combat](modern-d20-srd-combat-index) > Attack Bonus




## Attack Bonus


A characters attack bonus with a melee weapon is:
Base attack bonus + [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier + size modifier


With a ranged weapon, a characters attack bonus is:
Base attack bonus + [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier + range penalty + size modifier


### Strength Modifier


[Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) helps a character swing a weapon harder and faster, so a characters [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier applies to [melee
  attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) rolls.


### Size Modifier


| Table: Size Modifiers |  |
| :----------------------- | --: |
|  |  |
| Colossal (blue whale [90 ft. long]) | 8 |
| Gargantuan (gray whale [40 ft. long]) | 4 |
| Huge (elephant) | 2 |
| Large (lion) | 1 |
| Medium-size (human) | +0 |
| Small (German shepherd) | +1 |
| Tiny (housecat) | +2 |
| Diminutive (rat) | +4 |
| Fine (horsefly) | +8 |



Creature size categories are defined differently from the size categories for weapons and other objects. Since this size modifier applies to [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) against a melee weapon [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) or a ranged weapon [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll), two creatures of the same size strike each other normally, regardless of what size they actually are. Creature sizes are compatible with vehicle sizes.


### Dexterity Modifier


[Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) measures coordination and steadiness, so a characters [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier applies when the character attacks with a ranged weapon.


### Range Penalty


The range penalty for a ranged weapon depends on what weapon the character
  is using and how far away the target is. All ranged [weapons](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-weapons) and thrown [weapons](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-weapons)  have a range increment. Any attack from a distance of less than one range
  increment is not penalized for range. However, each full range increment causes
  a cumulative 2 penalty on the [attack
  roll](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll). A thrown weapon has a maximum range
  of five range increments. Ranged weapons that fire projectiles can shoot up
  to ten increments.
