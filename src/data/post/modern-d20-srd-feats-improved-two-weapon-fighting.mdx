## Improved Two-Weapon Fighting

Prerequisites: [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) 13, [Two- Weapon Fighting](modern-d20-srd-feats-two-weapon-fighting), base attack bonus
+6.

Benefit: The character gets a second [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) with his or her offhand weapon, albeit at a –5 penalty. Also, this feat
allows the character to use a melee weapon in one hand and a ranged weapon in
the other.

Normal: Without this feat, a character can only get a single extra attack with
an off-hand weapon, and both weapons must be of the same type (either both
ranged weapons or both melee weapons).
