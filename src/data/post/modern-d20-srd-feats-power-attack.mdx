## Power Attack

Prerequisite: [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) 13.

Benefit: On the characters action, before making [attack rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) for a round, the character may choose to subtract a number from all melee [attack rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) and add the same number to all melee [damage rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage). This number may not exceed the characters base attack bonus.

The penalty on attacks and bonus on damage applies until the characters next action.
