## Heroic Surge


Benefit: The character may take an extra [move
  action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions) or [attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) in a round, either before or after the characters regular actions. The character may use Heroic Surge a number of times per day depending on his or her character level (as shown below), but never more than once per round.
