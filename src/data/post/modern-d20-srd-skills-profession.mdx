## Profession ([Wis](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores))

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): A character
makes Profession [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) to improve his or her [Wealth bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus) every time he or she attains a new level. The DC for the
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) is the
character’s current [Wealth bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus). If the
character succeeds at the Profession [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), his or her [Wealth bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus) increases by +1. For every 5 by which the character
exceeds the DC, his or her [Wealth bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus)
increases by an additional +1. A character can’t [take 10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) or [take 20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index) when making a Profession
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) to improve
his or her [Wealth bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus).

How many ranks a character has in the Profession skill (including ranks the
character may have just acquired after gaining a level) also adds to the
[Wealth bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus) increase the character
receives upon gaining a new level. In addition to the [Wealth bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus) increase a character gains from
your Profession [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) result (if the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) succeeds), the number of ranks the character has in this skill
increases his or her [Wealth bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus) as
follows.


<table> <tr><th>Ranks</th> <th>Wealth Bonus Increase</th> </tr> <tr><td> 1–5</td><td> +1 </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> 6–10</td><td> +2 </td></tr> <tr><td> 11–15</td><td> +3 </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> 16–20</td><td> +4 </td></tr> <tr><td> 21–23</td><td> +5 </td></tr> </table>


Special: If the Gamemaster deems it appropriate, a character can add his or
her Profession modifier when making a [Reputation](modern-d20-srd-reputation-index) check to deal with a work- or career-related situation.

Every time a character takes the [Windfall](modern-d20-srd-feats-windfall)
feat, he or she gets a cumulative +1 bonus on all Profession
[checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).
