## Profession (Wis)

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): A character makes Profession [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) to improve his or her [Wealth bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus) every time he or she attains a new level. The DC for the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) is the character’s current [Wealth bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus). If the character succeeds at the Profession [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), his or her [Wealth bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus) increases by +1. For every 5 by which the character exceeds the DC, his or her [Wealth bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus) increases by an additional +1. A character can’t [take 10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) or [take 20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index) when making a Profession [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) to improve his or her [Wealth bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus).

How many ranks a character has in the Profession skill (including ranks the character may have just acquired after gaining a level) also adds to the [Wealth bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus) increase the character receives upon gaining a new level. In addition to the [Wealth bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus) increase a character gains from your Profession [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) result (if the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) succeeds), the number of ranks the character has in this skill increases his or her [Wealth bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus) as follows.

| Ranks | Wealth Bonus Increase |
| :---- | --------------------: |
| 1–5    |                    +1 |
| 6–10   |                    +2 |
| 11–15  |                    +3 |
| 16–20  |                    +4 |
| 21–23  |                    +5 |

Special: If the Gamemaster deems it appropriate, a character can add his or her Profession modifier when making a [Reputation](modern-d20-srd-reputation-index) check to deal with a work- or career-related situation.

Every time a character takes the [Windfall](modern-d20-srd-feats-windfall) feat, he or she gets a cumulative +1 bonus on all Profession [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).
