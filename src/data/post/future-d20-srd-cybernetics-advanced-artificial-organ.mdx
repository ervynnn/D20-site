## Advanced Artificial Organ (PL 7)


This advanced version of the PL 5 artificial organ and PL 6 upgrade not only replaces a defective or destroyed biological organ but is also more resilient and less impairing than its technological predecessors.


Benefit: The advanced artificial organ duplicates the function of its biological counterpart and cannot be disabled if the recipient takes massive damage (see Massive Damage Effects). In addition, the advanced organ does not count toward the total number of cybernetic attachments the recipient can have before taking negative levels (see Number of Attachments).


Type: Internal.


Hardness/Hit Points: â€“/4.


Base Purchase DC: 24.


Restriction: None.
