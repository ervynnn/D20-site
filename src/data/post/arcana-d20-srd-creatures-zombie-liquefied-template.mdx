     Zombie, Liquefied (Template)
    



     Liquefied zombies cannot speak. They are generally between 5 feet and 6 feet tall, and they weigh about 150 pounds.
Template Traits
    



     Liquefied zombie is an acquired template that can be added to any corporeal creature other than a construct, elemental, ooze, plant, or undead (referred to hereafter as the base creature). The creature must be in an advanced state of decay, but not yet reduced to a skeletal corpse. The liquefied zombie uses all the base creatures statistics and special abilities except as noted here.
    



     Challenge Rating: A liquefied zombies Challenge Rating equals the base creatures CR + the following modifier based on size: Tiny or smaller +0, Small +1, Medium +2, Large +4, Huge +5, Gargantuan +7, Colossal +10.
    



     Type: The creatures type changes to undead.
    



     Hit Dice: Drop any Hit Dice gained from experience, triple the number of Hit Dice left, and raise them to d12.
    



     Speed: If the base creature could fly, its maneuverability rating as a liquefied zombie drops to clumsy.
    



     Defense: A liquefied zombies natural armor bonus to Defense increases to the following, based on its size (but use the base creatures natural armor bonus if its higher): Small or smaller +0, Medium +1, Large +2, Huge +3, Gargantuan +6, Colossal +10.
    



     Attacks: The liquefied zombie retains all the natural attacks, manufactured weapons, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature. A liquefied zombie also gains a slam attack.
    



     Damage: Natural and manufactured weapons deal damage normally. A slam attack deals damage depending on the liquefied zombies size (but use the base creatures slam damage if its greater): Fine 1, Diminutive 1d2, Tiny 1d3, Small 1d4, Medium 1d6, Large 1d8, Huge 2d6, Gargantuan 2d8, Colossal 4d6.
    



     For purposes of Strength bonuses to damage, a slam attack attack is considered a two-handed attack.
    



     Special Qualities: A liquefied zombie loses all of the base creatures supernatural and spell-like qualities except for immunity or resistance to specific energy types. A liquefied zombie may retain any or all of the base creatures extraordinary abilities at the GMs discretion. In addition to gaining the undead type, a liquefied zombie has the following special quality.
    



     Liquefied Spew (Ex): Whenever a liquefied zombie is damaged in combat by anything other than a bludgeoning weapon, some of the liquefied tissue spews forth, covering everything within 5 feet of the liquefied zombie. The scalding liquid deals 1d6 points of damage and exposes anyone it touches to the disease of necrotizing faciitis.
    



     Darkvision (Ex): Liquefied zombies have darkvision with a range of 60 feet.
    



     Allegiances: A liquefied zombie loses any previous allegiances and adopts a new allegiance to its creator. This allegiance cannot be broken.
    



     Saves: A liquefied zombies saving throws are based on Hit Dice.
    



     Action Points: A liquefied zombie does not acquire or amass action points. It loses any action points gained by the base creature.
    



     Reputation Bonus: A liquefied zombie has a +0 Reputation bonus.
    



     Ability Scores: A liquefied zombies ability scores change as follows: Str +4, Dex 2. Additionally, it has no Constitution or Intelligence score, its Wisdom changes to 10, and its Charisma decreases to 1.
    



     Skills: The liquefied zombie loses all skills.
