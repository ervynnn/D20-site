##  Psionic Feats

Some spell-related feats are equally applicable to psionics. The following
psionic feats function as the named spell-related feats. Treat references to
spells as powers within these descriptions, and references to caster level as
manifester level.


<table> <tr> <td> Power Penetration </td> <td> As Spell Penetration </td> </tr> <tr class="shaded"> <td> Power Focus </td> <td> As Spell Focus </td> </tr> <tr> <td> Great Power Penetration </td> <td> As Greater Spell Penetration </td> </tr> <tr class="shaded"> <td> Greater Power Focus </td> <td> As Greater Spell Focus </td> </tr> </table>


Feats that require the choice of a school of spells would for its psionic
equivalent require choosing an attribute (ability score), to the same overall
effect. In addition, metapsionic feats function in much the same way as
metamagic feats. However, they require the additional expenditure of power
points (as opposed to increased spell levels) and as a result are presented
here.
