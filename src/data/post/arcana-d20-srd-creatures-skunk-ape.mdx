## 
     Skunk Ape
    



     Skunk apes speak their own language, which has no written form. They may read, write, and speak a number of additional languages equal to their Intelligence bonus (if any).
    


### 
     Species Traits
    



     Skunk apes have the following traits:
    



     Stench (Ex): Skunk apes exude a stench reminiscent of rotting vegetation, ammonia, and decay. When frightened or angry, they can intensify this odor such that all creatures within 30 feet of the skunk ape must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 12) or be nauseated for 2d6 rounds. A nauseated creature may take only a single move action per turn and may not perform actions requiring concentration or attention. Skunk apes are immune to their own stench but not to the stench of other creatures.
    



     Woodland Stride (Ex): The oily fur of the skunk ape allows it to pass through any sort of undergrowth (thorn bushes, briars, cranberry bogs, and other overgrown areas) at normal speed.
    



     Darkvision (Ex): Skunk apes can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and skunk apes can function with no light at all.
    



     Bonus Feat: Skunk apes gain the bonus feat Alertness.
