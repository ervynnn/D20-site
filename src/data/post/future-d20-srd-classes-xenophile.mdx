### Class Features


The following class features pertain to the Xenophile advanced class.


Xenolore
A Xenophile can make a Knowledge check to identify certain characteristics of a xenomorph, including any special attacks, special qualities, or vulnerabilities. In general, the DC of the Knowledge check equals 10 + the xenomorphs Hit Dice. A successful check allows the Xenophile to unlock a single fact about the xenomorph. For every 5 points by which her check result exceeds the DC, the Xenophile learns another piece of useful information.


The type of Knowledge check depends on the xenomorphs creature type, as shown below:


Knowledge (arcane lore): Fey, magical beasts.


Knowledge (earth and life sciences): Aberrations, animals, dragons, elementals, giants, humanoids, monstrous humanoids,
oozes, plants, vermin.


Knowledge (technology): Constructs.


Knowledge (theology and philosophy): Outsiders, undead.


Xenotype
A Xenophile studies the behaviors and weaknesses of particular xenomorphs and knows how to exploit them.


At 1st level, a Xenophile may select a type of creature (also called a xenotype) from among those given on Table: Xenotypes. She must meet the special prerequisite to choose a xenotype, as specified in the table. Due to her extensive study of the chosen type of foe and training in the proper techniques for combating or negotiating with such creatures, the Xenophile gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Intimidate, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against members of the chosen xenotype. Likewise, she gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such creatures.


At 4th, 7th, and 10th level, the Xenophile may select an additional xenotype from those given on the table. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one xenotype (including the one just selected, if desired) increases by 2. A Xenophile who chooses humanoids as a xenotype must also specify a particular species.

The Xenophile can select a new opponent on any action. At 10th level, the insight bonus to Defense increases to +2.
