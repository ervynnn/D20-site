## Gladiator


Gladiators have been fighting all their lives, whether on the streets or in some form of arena. They include disenchanted youths and poverty-stricken hoodlums looking to trade fists for cash, clones bred in secret labs to fight from birth, and low-ranking members of a societyâ€™s warrior caste.

Balance (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (streetwise) (Int), Tumble (Dex).

Wealth Bonus Increase: +1.
