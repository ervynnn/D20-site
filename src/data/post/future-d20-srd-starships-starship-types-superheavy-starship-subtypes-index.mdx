## Superheavy Starship Subtypes


Superheavy starships include mammoth, ponderous dreadnoughts, super-carriers, and super-freighters.


A superheavy starship measures 1,501 feet long or longer. The smallest superheavy starships (measuring 1,501'2,000 feet long) have a 2,000-foot-by-2,000-foot fighting space (16 500-foot squares), although larger fighting spaces are possible.


In addition, all superheavy starships share the following design specs.


Engines: All superheavy starships have thrusters plus as many as two other types of engine (see Starship Engines).


Armor: A superheavy starship has one type of armor (see Starship Armor).


Defensive Systems: A superheavy starship has a maximum of one defensive system per 150 Hit Dice (see Starship Defense Systems).


Sensors: A superheavy starship has a maximum of three sensor systems (see Starship Sensors).


Communications: A superheavy starship has two external communication systems (see Starship Comm Systems).


Weapons: A superheavy starship has one beam, projectile, or missile weapon per 150 Hit Dice (see Starship Weapons). These weapons are often arrayed in batteries. A minelayer is considered a single weapon. Although it weighs no more than a few thousand pounds, each mine consumes 100 tons of a ship's cargo capacity (most of it taken up by the launch system and radiation shielding).


Grappling Systems: A superheavy starship may have up to two grappling systems (see Grappling Systems). Each grappling system takes away one of the ship's weapon slots (see above).
