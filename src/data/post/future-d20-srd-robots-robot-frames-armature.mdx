## Armature (PL 5)


The most basic of robot designs, armatures are essentially mechanical skeletons.


To build an armature frame from scratch, a character must succeed at a Craft (mechanical) check (DC 20) after investing time in the frame's construction: 12 hours for a Tiny or smaller frame, 24 hours for a Small to Large frame, or 48 hours for a Huge or larger frame. A character without a mechanical tool kit takes a '4 penalty on the skill check. The character must also make a Wealth check against the frame's purchase DC.


Table: Armature Robot Frames provides the base purchase DC, Hit Dice, and ability scores for factory-model armature robots, as well as purchase DC modifiers for improving ability scores.


Immunities: Robots with armature frames have all the normal construct immunities, including immunity to critical hits.
Restriction: None.
