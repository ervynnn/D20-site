     Maniac (Template)

###

     Template Traits




     Maniac is an acquired template that can be added to any humanoid or monstrous humanoid (referred to hereafter as the base creature). The creature retains its original type. It uses all the base creatures statistics and special abilities except as noted here.




     Challenge Rating: Same as base creature +1.




     Hit Dice: Change to d12.




     Attacks: A maniac retains all the attacks of the base creature and gains a slam attack if the base creature didnt already have one. If the base creature did not have a slam attack, use the base damage values in the table below. Otherwise, use the values below or the base creatures base damage, whichever is greater.

| Size        | Slam Damage |
| :---------- | ----------: |
| Fine        |           1 |
| Diminutive  |         1d2 |
| Tiny        |         1d3 |
| Small       |         1d4 |
| Medium-size |         1d6 |
| Large       |         1d8 |
| Huge        |         2d6 |
| Gargantuan  |         2d8 |
| Colossal    |         4d6 |

     Special Qualities: A maniac retains all the special qualities of the base creature and gains the additional qualities described below.




     Ability Surge (Ex): Once per day as a free action, the maniac can temporarily increase its Strength and Dexterity scores, but doing so imposes a penalty on its saving throws. While this ability is in effect, the maniac gains a +4 morale bonus to both Strength and Dexterity but takes a 2 penalty on all saving throws. Ability surge lasts for a number of rounds equal to the maniacs character level. Following an ability surge, the maniac is fatigued (2 to Strength and Dexterity) for as many rounds as the surge was in effect, but it may negate this penalty as a free action by spending an action point.




     Damage Reduction 5/ (Ex): A maniac ignores the first 5 points of damage dealt by any attack.




     Immunities (Ex): A maniac is immune to mind-affecting effects.




     Resistance to Massive Damage (Ex): A maniac gains a +5 species bonus on Fortitude saves to negate the effects of massive damage.




     Allegiances: Previous allegiances are lost and replaced by allegiances to chaos and evil. Changed allegiances might cause the loss of particular class abilities.




     Saves: Same as the base creature, with a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves, and modified by new ability scores.




     Ability Scores: A maniac gains the following ability score increases: Str +4, Con +4.





      Feats:

     A maniac gains Improved Damage Threshold and Toughness as bonus feats.
