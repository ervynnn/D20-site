## Inertial Flux Engine (PL 8)


By precisely controlling the quantum energy level of every atom on the ship simultaneously, the inertial flux engine assumes the inertial states necessary to produce motion in any direction. In effect, by operating the controls, the pilot chooses from instant to instant what vector the ship's atoms will next possess, and the inertial flux engine alters them simultaneouslyÂ—along with everything else aboard, including the crew and passengers. An inertial flux engine does not operate within a planetary atmosphere, and most ships fitted with this kind of engine also have secondary thrusters or rely on shuttlecraft.


Minimum Ship Size: Gargantuan.


Tactical Speed Bonus: +1,500 feet (+3 squares).


Purchase DC: 15 + one-half the base purchase DC of the starship.
