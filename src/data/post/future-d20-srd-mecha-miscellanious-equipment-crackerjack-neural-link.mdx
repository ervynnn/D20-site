## Crackerjack Neural Link (PL 8)


This unit links the operator's brain directly to the mecha, making it feel less like a machine and more like an extension of the operator's body. While driving or piloting the mecha, the operator gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks. In addition, the operator can use any of his nonmecha-specific feats while operating a mecha. (This ability does not grant the operator any new feats.)



Equipment Slots: 1, must be helmet or cranium.
Activation: None.
Range: Personal.
Target: You.
Duration: Persistent.
Saving Throw: None.
Purchase DC: 15 + one-quarter the mecha's base purchase DC.
Restriction: Restricted (+2).
