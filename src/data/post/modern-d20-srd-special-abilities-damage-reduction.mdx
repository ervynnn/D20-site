## Damage Reduction (Su)

The creature ignores [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) from most weapons
and natural [attacks](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions). Wounds heal
immediately, or the [weapon](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-weapons)
bounces off harmlessly (in either case, the opponent knows the
[attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) was ineffective). The creature
takes normal damage from energy attacks (even nonmagical ones),
[spells](modern-d20-srd-fx-index), spell-like abilities, and supernatural
abilities. A [magic weapon](modern-d20-srd-fx-items-weapons) or a creature
with its own damage reduction can sometimes [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) the creature normally, as noted below.

The entry indicates the amount of [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
ignored and the type of [weapon](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-weapons)
that negates the ability.

Any [weapon](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-weapons) more powerful than
the type listed in the note also negates the ability. A
[weapon](modern-d20-srd-fx-items-weapons) with an enhancement bonus due to
magic is considered more powerful than any [weapon](modern-d20-srd-fx-items-weapons) that does not have such a bonus.

For purposes of harming other creatures with damage reduction, a creature’s
natural weapons count as the type that ignores its own innate damage
reduction. However, damage reduction from [spells](modern-d20-srd-fx-index)
does not confer this ability. The amount of damage reduction is irrelevant.
