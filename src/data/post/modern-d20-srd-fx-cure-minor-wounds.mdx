[Level](modern-d20-srd-fx-level)
:
[Acolyte](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-acolyte)
0;
[Components](modern-d20-srd-fx-components)
: V, S;
[Casting Time](modern-d20-srd-fx-casting-time)
;
[Attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions)
[Range](modern-d20-srd-fx-range)

[Saving Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
: Will half (harmless) (see text);
[Spell Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance)
: Yes (harmless)

     The caster lays his or her hand upon a living creature and channels positive

energy that cures 1 point of
[damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
.

     Since
     [undead](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-undead)
     are powered

by negative energy, this spell deals
[damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
to
them instead of curing their wounds. An
[undead](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-undead)
creature
can attempt a
[Will save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
to take half
[damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
.
