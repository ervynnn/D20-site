## Gamble ([Wis](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores))

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): To join or
start a game, a character must first pay a stake. The character sets the
purchase DC of the stake if he or she starts the game, or the GM sets it if
the character joins a game. Stakes run from penny-ante (purchase DC 4) to
astronomical (purchase DC 24). A character cannot [take 20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index) when purchasing a stake.

If the stake is within the character’s means (it is equal to or less than his
or her [Wealth bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus)), the character
stands no chance of winning any significant amount. The character might come
out ahead, but the amount is not enough to affect his or her [Wealth bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus). Since paying the stake didn’t cost
any points of [Wealth bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus), the
character doesn’t lose anything either.

If the stake is higher than the character’s [Wealth bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus) (before applying any reductions from purchasing the
stake), the character gets a +1 bonus on his or her Gamble
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) for every
point the purchase DC is above the character’s [Wealth bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus).

The character’s Gamble [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) is opposed by the Gamble [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) of all other participants in the game. (If
playing at a casino, assume the house has a Gamble skill modifier equal to the
stake purchase DC. Regardless of the stake purchase DC, the house does not get
a bonus on its Gamble [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) for the purchase DC.) If there are many characters participating,
the GM can opt to make a single roll for all of them, using the highest Gamble
skill modifier among them and adding a +2 bonus to the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

If the character beats all other participants, he or she wins and gains an
increase to his or her [Wealth bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus). The
amount of the increase depends on the difference between the character’s
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) result and
the next highest result among the other participants.

Try Again?: No, unless the character wants to put up another stake.

Special: A character can’t [take 10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) or [take 20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index) when making a Gamble [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

A character with the [Confident](modern-d20-srd-feats-confident) feat gets a
+2 bonus on all Gamble [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

Time: A Gamble [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) requires 1 hour.
