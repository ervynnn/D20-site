## Seed: Life


Conjuration (Healing)



Knowledge (arcane lore) DC: 33; Range: Touch; Target: Dead creature touched; Duration: Instantaneous; Saving Throw: None (see text); Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)


An incantation developed with the life seed will restore life and complete vigor to any deceased creature. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creatures body still exists, it can be returned to life, but the portion receiving the incantation must have been part of the creatures body at the time of death.


The creature is immediately restored to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no loss of prepared spells. However, the subject loses 1 level (or 1 point of Constitution if the subject was 1st level). You cannot revive someone who has died of old age.


You can also use the life seed to give an animal or plant a soul, personality, and sentience. For each point of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma you give your creation, increase the Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by +1. You cant create a creature with a higher Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma than you have.


The newly sentient animal or plant is friendly toward you. The newly sentient creature understands one language automatically; to give the creature the ability to speak, increase the Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by +1.
