## Listen ([Wis](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores))

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): Make a
Listen [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index)
against a DC that reflects how quiet the noise is that a character might hear
or against an opposed [Move Silently](modern-d20-srd-skills-move-silently)
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

The GM may call for a Listen [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) by a character who is in a position to hear something.
A character can also make a Listen [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) voluntarily if he or she wants to try to hear something
in the character’s vicinity.

The GM may make the Listen [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) in secret so that the character doesn’t know whether
not hearing anything means that nothing is there or that the character failed
the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

A successful Listen [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) when there isn’t anything to hear results in the character
hearing nothing.

Try Again?: A character can make a Listen [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) every time he or she has the opportunity to hear
something in a reactive manner. As a [move action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions), the character may attempt to hear something that he or she failed
(or believes he or she failed) to hear previously.

Special: When several characters are listening to the same thing, the GM can
make a single 1d20 roll and use it for all the listeners’ skill
[checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

A character can [take 10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index)
or [take 20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index) when making
a Listen check. [Taking 20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index) means the character spends 1 minute attempting to hear
something that may or may not be there to hear.

A character with the [Alertness](modern-d20-srd-feats-alertness) feat gets a
+2 bonus on all Listen [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

A sleeping character can make Listen [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), but takes a –10 penalty on the
[checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

Time: A Listen [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) is either a reaction (if called for by the GM) or a [move action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions) (if a character actively takes the
time to try to hear something).
