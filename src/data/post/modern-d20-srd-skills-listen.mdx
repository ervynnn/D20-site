## Listen (Wis)

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): Make a Listen [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) against a DC that reflects how quiet the noise is that a character might hear or against an opposed [Move Silently](modern-d20-srd-skills-move-silently) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

The GM may call for a Listen [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) by a character who is in a position to hear something. A character can also make a Listen [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) voluntarily if he or she wants to try to hear something in the characters vicinity.

The GM may make the Listen [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) in secret so that the character doesnt know whether not hearing anything means that nothing is there or that the character failed the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

A successful Listen [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) when there isnt anything to hear results in the character hearing nothing.

| DC  |                                                                     Sound |

| 10  |                                                            A melee battle |
| 0   |                                                            People talking |
| 5   | A person in medium armor walking at a slow pace, trying not to make noise |
| 10  |  An unarmored person walking at a slow pace, trying not to make any noise |

| +5  |                                                            Through a door |
| +15 |                                                      Through a solid wall |

| 1 This is actually an opposed check; the DC given is a typical [Move Silently](modern-d20-srd-skills-move-silently) check result for such a character or creature. | |

| Condition               | Check Penalty |
| :---------------------- | ------------: |
| Per 10 feet of distance |             1 |
| Listener distracted     |             5 |

Try Again?: A character can make a Listen [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) every time he or she has the opportunity to hear something in a reactive manner. As a [move action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions), the character may attempt to hear something that he or she failed (or believes he or she failed) to hear previously.

Special: When several characters are listening to the same thing, the GM can make a single 1d20 roll and use it for all the listeners skill [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

A character can [take 10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) or [take 20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index) when making a Listen check. [Taking 20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index) means the character spends 1 minute attempting to hear something that may or may not be there to hear.

A character with the [Alertness](modern-d20-srd-feats-alertness) feat gets a +2 bonus on all Listen [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

A sleeping character can make Listen [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), but takes a 10 penalty on the [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

Time: A Listen [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) is either a reaction (if called for by the GM) or a [move action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions) (if a character actively takes the time to try to hear something).
