## 
     Starship Sensors
    



     A starship would be lost in the blackness of outer space without a sophisticated sensor array enabling it to perceive its surroundings. Sensor arrays allow a starship's crew to plot safe courses through unexplored star systems, avoid comets and electromagnetic storms, navigate asteroid belts, analyze planetary surface conditions, detect other starships nearby, and analyze damage to the ship's outer hull. Without a functional sensor array, a ship and its crew are virtually paralyzed.
    



     This section describes several standard sensor arrays. Each sensor array includes a list of functions; each function requires a move action and a successful Computer Use check (DC 15).
    



     To build a sensor system from scratch, a character must succeed at a Craft (electronic) check (DC 30) after investing 60 hours in its assembly. A character without an electrical tool kit takes a '4 penalty on the skill check. The character must also make a Wealth check against the sensor system's purchase DC.
Installing a sensor system requires a successful Craft (electrical) check (DC 30) after investing 30 hours. A character without an electrical tool kit takes a '4 penalty on the skill check.
    



     Different types of sensor systems are detailed below.
    



     Purchase DC: The purchase DC of the system.
    



     Restriction: The level of license required to purchase the system legally.
