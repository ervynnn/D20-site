## 
    Robot Repair Unit (PL 8)
   



    The RRU enables a robot to repair itself or another robot by replacing damaged parts with replicated new ones. In the latter case, the robot making the repairs must be adjacent to the damaged robot. The robot must spend a full-round action to repair itself or another robot; this automatically restores 1d10 points of damage (no Repair check necessary).
   



    Purchase DC: 28.
   



    Restriction: Licensed (+1).
