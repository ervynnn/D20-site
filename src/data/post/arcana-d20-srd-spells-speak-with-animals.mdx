##  Speak with Animals

Divination

Level: Divine 2; Components: V, S; Casting Time: Attack action; Range:
Personal; Target: You; Duration: 1 minute/ level

You can comprehend and communicate with animals. You are able to ask questions
of and receive answers from animals, although the spell doesnâ€™t make animals
any more friendly or cooperative than normal. Furthermore, wary and cunning
animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while the more stupid ones make
inane comments. If the animal is friendly, it may do some favor or service for
you (as determined by the GM).

This spell does not work on magical beasts or vermin.
