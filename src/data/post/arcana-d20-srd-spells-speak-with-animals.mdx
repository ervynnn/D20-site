## 
     Speak with Animals
    



     Divination
    



     Level: Divine 2; Components: V, S; Casting Time: Attack action; Range: Personal; Target: You; Duration: 1 minute/ level
    



     You can comprehend and communicate with animals. You are able to ask questions of and receive answers from animals, although the spell doesnt make animals any more friendly or cooperative than normal. Furthermore, wary and cunning animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while the more stupid ones make inane comments. If the animal is friendly, it may do some favor or service for you (as determined by the GM).
    



     This spell does not work on magical beasts or vermin.
