Ranged weapons that are not firearms include such diverse objects as
crossbows, tasers, and pepper spray. The feat that provides proficiency with
these weapons varies from weapon to weapon, as indicated on Table: Ranged
Weapons.

### Compound Bow

Bow hunting remains a popular sport in North America. A character’s
[Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier applies to
[damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) rolls made when using this weapon.

### Crossbow

A crossbow requires two hands to use. Pulling a lever draws the bow. Loading a
crossbow is a [move action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions) that provokes
[attacks of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity).

### Flamethrower

A flamethrower consists of a pressurized backpack containing fuel, connected
to a tube with a nozzle. It shoots a 5-foot-wide, 30-foot-long line of flame
that deals 3d6 points of fire [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) to all
creatures and objects in its path. No [attack roll](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) is necessary, and thus no feat is needed to operate the weapon
effectively. Any creature caught in the line of flame can make a [Reflex save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) (DC 15) to take half damage.
Creatures with cover get a bonus on their [Reflex save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws).

A flamethrower’s backpack has hardness 5 and 5 hit points. When worn, the
backpack has a [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) equal to 9 + the
wearer’s [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier + the
wearer’s class bonus. A backpack reduced to 0 hit points ruptures and
explodes, dealing 6d6 points of fire [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) to
the wearer (no save allowed) and 3d6 points of splash [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) to creatures and objects in adjacent 5-foot squares (Reflex
save, DC 15, for half damage).

Any creature or flammable object that takes damage from a flamethrower catches
on fire, taking 1d6 points of fire [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) each
subsequent round until the flames are extinguished. A fire engulfing a single
creature or object can be doused or smothered as a [full-round action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions). Discharging a fire
extinguisher is a move action and instantly smothers flames in a 10-foot-
by-10-foot area.

A flamethrower can shoot 10 times before the fuel supply is depleted.
Refilling or replacing a fuel pack has a purchase DC of 13.

### Javelin

This light, flexible spear built for throwing can be used in melee, but since
it’s not designed for it, characters using it in this manner are always
considered nonproficient and take a –4 penalty on their melee [attack rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll).

### Pepper Spray

A chemical irritant that can temporarily blind a target, pepper spray comes in
a single-shot container. To use it, make a [ranged touch attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) against the target. The target
must make a Fortitude [saving throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) (DC
15) or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. Pepper spray is limited to 5 range
increments.

### Shuriken

A shuriken is a thrown, star-shaped projectile with four to eight razor-sharp
points. A character may draw a shuriken as a [free action](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types).

### Taser

A taser uses springs or compressed air to fire a pair of darts at a target. On
impact, the darts release a powerful electrical current. On a successful hit,
the darts deal 1d4 points of electricity [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) and the target must make a Fortitude [saving throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) (DC 15) or be paralyzed for 1d6 rounds. Reloading a
taser is a [full-round action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions) that
provokes [attacks of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity).

### Whip

Whips deal a small amount of lethal [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage).
Although a character doesn’t “fire” the weapon, treat a whip as a ranged
weapon with a maximum range of 15 feet and no range penalties.

Because a whip can wrap around an enemy’s leg or other limb, a character can
make a [trip](modern-d20-srd-combat-trip) attack with it by succeeding at a
[ranged touch attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types). The character does
not provoke an [attack of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity) when using a whip in this way. If the character is tripped during
his or her own [trip](modern-d20-srd-combat-trip) attempt, the character can
drop the whip to avoid being tripped.

When using a whip, a character gets a +2 bonus on your opposed [attack roll](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) when attempting to
[disarm](modern-d20-srd-combat-disarm) an opponent (including the roll to keep
from being [disarmed](modern-d20-srd-combat-disarm) if the character fails to
[disarm](modern-d20-srd-combat-disarm) the opponent).
