## Drifter
   



    Drifters are aimless wanderers and worldwise jacks-of-all-trades who move between cities or star systems, working odd jobs until boredom or fate leads them elsewhere. Along the way, they learn strange customs and pick up interesting and diverse skills.
   



    Prerequisite: Age 15+.
   



    Skills: Choose three of the following skills as permanent class skills. If a skill you select is already a class skill, you gain a +1 competence bonus on checks using that skill.
   



    Bluff (Cha), Decipher Script (Int), Disable Device (Int), Disguise (Cha), Forgery (Int), Gamble (Wis), Gather Information (Cha), Hide (Dex), Knowledge (streetwise) (Int), Navigate (Int), Sleight of Hand (Dex).
   



    Wealth Bonus Increase: +2.
