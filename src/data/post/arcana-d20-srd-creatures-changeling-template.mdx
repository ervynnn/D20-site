## Changeling (Template)

Template Traits

Changeling is an inherited template that can be added to any Small or Medium humanoid, monstrous humanoid, or outsider (referred to hereafter as the base creature). The changeling uses all all the base creatures statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature +2.

Type: The creatures type changes to fey.

Hit Dice: Change to d6.

Special Qualities: A changeling retains all of the base creatures extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like qualities except for qualities tied to its type. In addition to gaining the fey type, a changeling has the following special qualities.

Spell-like Abilities: 1/daycharm person, object reading; 3/daydetect magical aura. The changelings manifester level is equal to his or her character level.

Immunities (Ex): A changeling picks one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic/concussion) to which it is immune.

Resistance to Energy (Ex): A changeling gains energy resistance 10 to one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic/concussion). A changeling cannot be resistant to an energy type to which it is immune (see above).

Damage Reduction 5/+1 (Su): A changeling ignores the first 5 points of damage dealt by a nonmagical weapon. Unlike sidhe, this damage reduction doesnt increase as the changeling gains Hit Dice or levels.

Allegiances: A changeling has an allegiance to chaos, but unlike other sidhe, chaos need not be the primary allegiance. This allegiance cannot be broken.

Ability Scores: A changelings ability scores change as follows: Dex +4, Con 2, Cha +4.

Skill Bonuses: Changelings gain a +2 species bonus on Bluff and Sleight of Hand checks.

Feats: As the base creature. Unlike sidhe, changelings do not gain Archaic Weapons Proficiency or Simple Weapons Proficiency as bonus feats.
