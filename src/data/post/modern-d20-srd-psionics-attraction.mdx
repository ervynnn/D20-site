[ Charisma ](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) [Compulsion, Mind- Affecting]

Level: [ Telepath ](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-telepath) 1; Display:
Audible; Manifestation Time: [ Attack action ](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) ; Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels); Target: One living

The manifester plants a compelling attraction in the mind of the target. The
attraction can be toward a particular person, an object, an action, or an
event. The power’s target takes reasonable steps to meet, get close to,
attend, find, or perform the object of its implanted attraction. For the
purposes of this power, “reasonable” means that while fascinated, the target
doesn’t suffer from blind obsession. The target will not undertake obviously
self-destructive actions. The subject can still recognize danger, but will not
flee unless the threat is immediate. If the manifester makes the target feel
an attraction to the manifester, the manifester can’t command the subject
indiscriminately, although he or she will be willing to listen to the
manifester (even if the subject disagrees). This power grants the manifester a
+4 bonus to his or her [ Charisma ](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)
modifier when dealing with the subject.
