## 
     Jynx
    


### 
     Species Traits
    



     Electricity Immunity (Ex): A jynx is immune to electricity damage, though a successful attack that deals such damage causes it to become visible (see below).
    



     Natural Invisibility (Su): A jynx remains invisible even when attacking. Any creature that correctly discerns its location despite being unable to see it has a 50% miss chance on melee and ranged attacks. This ability is always active, but the jynx can suppress or resume it at will as a free action.
    



     Rending Claws (Ex): A jynxs claws ignore the hardness of items made of wood, metal, or plastic.
    



     Skill Bonus: A jynx gains a +4 species bonus on Disable Device checks.
    



     Spider Climb (Sp): A jynx can travel on any surface as though affected by a spider climb spell. This ability is always active.
