## Undead

An undead is a once-living creature animated by spiritual or supernatural
forces. See Table: Undead for physical ability scores, recommended minimum Hit
Dice, and damage based on size.

Hit Die: d12.

Base Attack Bonus: 1/2 of total Hit Dice (see [Table: Creature Saves and Base Attack Bonuses](modern-d20-srd-combat-index)).

Good Saving Throws: [Will](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws).

Skill Points: 3 x [Int](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) score, plus 2
points per Hit Dice beyond 1 HD.

[Feats](modern-d20-srd-feats-index): 1 + [Int](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier, plus 1 [feat](modern-d20-srd-feats-index) per 4 HD beyond 1

Undead share the following additional traits.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Undead receive either [Archaic Weapons Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-archaic-weapons-proficiency) or [Simple Weapons Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-simple-weapons-proficiency) as a
bonus feat. An undead is proficient with its natural weapons and any weapon
mentioned in its entry. Undead noted for wearing armor gain the bonus feat
Armor Proficiency with whatever type of armor they are accustomed to wearing
([light](modern-d20-srd-feats-armor-proficiency-light),
[medium](modern-d20-srd-feats-armor-proficiency-medium),
[heavy](modern-d20-srd-feats-armor-proficiency-heavy)), as well as all lighter
types.

Ability Scores: An undead has no [Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) score. It uses its [Charisma](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)
modifier for [Concentration](modern-d20-srd-skills-concentration)
[checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

[Darkvision](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-darkvision) (Ex): Most undead
have [darkvision](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-darkvision) with a range of
60 feet.

Immunities: Undead are immune to [poison](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-poison), sleep, paralysis, stunning, [disease](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-disease), necromantic effects, and mind-affecting effects. They are
not subject to [critical hits](modern-d20-srd-combat-critical-hits), nonlethal
[damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage), ability damage, ability drain, energy
drain, or effects of massive damage, or any effect requiring a Fortitude save
unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless.

Healing: Undead cannot heal [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) on their
own if they have no [Intelligence](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)
score. Undead can be healed with negative energy (usually only available
through the use of magic). Most undead are destroyed immediately if reduced to
0 [hit points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points) or less.

Special: Undead cannot be raised from the dead.
