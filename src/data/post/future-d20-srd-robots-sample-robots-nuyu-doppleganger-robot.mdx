## Nuyu Doppelganger Robot (PL 7)


Each doppelganger robot is modeled after a specific person. Nuyu bioreplicas are often used as doubles for politicians and movie stars during high-risk public appearances. Government agencies also use them as spies and infiltrators. A Nuyu is usually programmed with enough knowledge of its biological counterpart to maintain the charade for a period of a few hours or days.
