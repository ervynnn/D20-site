## 
     Seed: Compel
    



     Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting, Language-Dependent]
    



     Knowledge (arcane lore) DC: 30; Range: Close; Target: One living creature; Duration: Hours (D); Saving Throw: Will negates; Spell Resistance: Yes
You compel a target to follow a specified course of activity.
    



     At the basic level of effect, an incantation using the compel seed must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect. However, urging a dragon to stop attacking your friends so that everyone could jointly assault a mob safehouse elsewhere is a reasonable use of the incantations power.
    



     The compelled course of activity can continue for the entire duration, such as in the case of the dragon mentioned above. If the compelled activity can be completed in a shorter time, the incantation ends when the subject finishes what he was asked to do. You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might compel a rock star to give her the first panhandler she meets a ride in her limo. If the condition is not met before the incantation using this seed expires, the activity is not performed.
