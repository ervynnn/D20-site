## Civilian Trucks


Trucks usually have the same features as civilian cars, with the same luxury options. Trucks provide three-quarters cover to their occupants, except as noted below. The operative skill for trucks is Drive.

### Cretan Motors Hecaton (PL 6)


The national automobile company of Crete came late to the industry, but has made impressive strides toward winning over truck buyers. The Hekatoncheires pickup truckinaccurately referred to as the Hecaton by its target marketcombines impressive power with high durability and generous cargo room in the bed. The sixwheel design includes puncture-resistant tires and is popular with construction companies. The cab can be sealed against harsh environmentsads show them driving into lakes and being pulled out with the interior dry as a bone and the occupants casually listening to the stereo. The Hekatoncheires is 3 squares wide and 4 squares long.


### Cretan Motors Kentaur (PL 6)


Cretan Motors produces a smaller, faster, light-duty pickup with many of the same features of the larger Hekatoncheires but without all the cargo space. The Kentaur is 2 squares wide and 3 squares long.


### Gaia Motor Company Virgo (PL 6)


The Gaia Motor Company developed a line of automobiles powered by the popular fusion minireactor. The Virgo minivan is a top seller, capable of high speeds yet comfortably easy to handle. It is 2 squares wide and 3 squares long.


### Zhang Motors XRL (PL 7)


The XRL is designed to operate using a less expensive particle reactor, rather than t he s lightly more stable fusion minireactor. This gamble ultimately paid off when an XRL won the Australian Rally Challenge. The XRL comes only in a two-door style. It is 2 squares wide and 3 squares long.
