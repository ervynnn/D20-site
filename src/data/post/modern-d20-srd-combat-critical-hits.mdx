## Critical Hits

When a character makes an [attack roll](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) and gets a natural 20 (the d20 shows 20), the character hits regardless of the target’s [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense), and the character has scored a threat of a critical hit. To find out if it is actually a critical hit, the character immediately makes another [attack roll](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) with all the same modifiers as the [attack roll](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) that scored the threat. If the second roll also results in a hit against the target’s [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense), the attack is a [critical hit](modern-d20-srd-combat-critical-hits). (The second roll just needs to hit to confirm a critical hit; the character doesn’t need to roll a second 20.) If the second roll is a miss, then the attack just deals the [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) of a regular hit.

A critical hit multiplies the character’s [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage). Unless otherwise specified,
the multiplier is x2. (It is possible for some weapons to have higher multipliers,
doing more [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) on a critical hit.) Some weapons have expanded threat ranges,
making a critical hit more likely. However, even with these weapons, only a
20 is an automatic hit. The Critical column on the [weapon description pages](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-weapons) indicate the threat range for each weapon on the tables.

Bonus [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) represented as extra dice is not multiplied when a character scores a critical hit.

Objects (including vehicles) and some types of creatures are immune to critical hits. A 20 is always a successful hit, but deals no extra [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) against these targets.
