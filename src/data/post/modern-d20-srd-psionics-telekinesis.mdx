## Telekinesis

[Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)

Level: [Telepath](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-telepath) 4; Display:
Visual; Manifestation Time: [Attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions); Range: Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level); Target or Targets: See text;
Duration: [Concentration](modern-d20-srd-skills-concentration), up to 1
round/level, or instantaneous (see text); [Saving Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): Will negates (object) (see text); [Power Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-power-resistance): Yes (object)
(see text); Power Point Cost: 7

The manifester moves objects or creatures by concentrating on them. The power
can provide either a gentle, sustained force or a single short, violent thrust
(manifester’s choice).

Sustained Force: A sustained force moves a creature or object weighing up to
25 pounds per manifester level up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate
the effect against itself or against an object it possesses with a successful
[Will save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) or with [power resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-power-resistance).

This power lasts up to 1 round per manifester level, but it ends if the
manifester ceases concentration. The weight can be moved vertically,
horizontally, or both. An object can’t be moved beyond the range. The power
ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If the manifester ceases
concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops.

An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand, if the force
required is within the weight limitation.

Violent Thrust: Alternatively, the telekinetic power can be expended in a
single round. The manifester can hurl one or more objects or creatures that
are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within
10 feet/level of all the objects. A manifester can hurl up to a total weight
of 25 pounds per manifester level.

The manifester must succeed at [attack rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items,
using his or her base attack plus [Intelligence](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier. [Weapons](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-weapons) cause standard [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) (with no
[Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) bonus). Other objects cause
[damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for
less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) per 25 pounds for hard, dense objects.

Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the power can be hurled, but
they are allowed [Will saves](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) to negate
the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the power. If
creatures are telekinetically hurled against solid surfaces, they take
[damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) as if they had [fallen](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-falling) 10 feet (1d6 points).
