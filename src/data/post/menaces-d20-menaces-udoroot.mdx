## 
     Udoroot
    



     Udoroots are enormous carnivorous plants that possess psionic powers. The bulk of an udoroot lies beneath the soil. Its massive, bulbous root system can reach down as far as 30 feet below the surface. The above-ground portion of the plant consists of six stalks, each topped by a single flower crown. These crowns resemble mature sunflowers with red seeds, white petals, and tough, woody stalks. They grow in a circle that can reach 20 feet in diameter.
    



     An udoroot can be killed only by digging up or otherwise exposing its root, then burning it, hacking it apart, or totally destroying it in some other manner. Severing or psionically disabling all six crowns negates the plants ability to attack and makes excavation of the root easier. To sever a crown, an opponent must penetrate the woody bark of the stalk (hardness 5, hp 7). A severed crown dies, but the udoroot suffers no ill effects other than its absence. As long as the creatures root remains intact, any severed crowns regrow in about a month. A psionic creature can also overcome a crown in psionic combat by reducing any one of the creatures ability scores to 0. This attack does not harm the main root or any other crowns, which must be attacked separately to deal any damage.

     Species Traits
    



     Blindsight (Ex): An udoroot is blind but can ascertain all creatures and objects within 40 feet just as a sighted creature would. Beyond that range, all targets have total concealment with respect to the udoroot
    



     Cold Resistance 20 (Ex): An udoroot ignores the first 20 points of cold damage from any single attack.
    



     Immunities (Ex): An udoroot is immune to electricity and fire damage.
    



     Plant: Udoroots have the traits and immunities common to plants.
    



     Psionics (Sp): At willfalse sensory input, lesser body adjustment, lightning strike, telekinesis. Manifester level 10th; save DC 10 + udoroots key ability modifier + power level.
