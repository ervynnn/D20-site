## Magical Heritage [Initial]

You have magical ability in your background, such as a sorcerer in your bloodline, or you gained access to magic at a particularly young age (by discovering a spellbook in your attic, for example). As a result, you mastered some basic spellcasting.

Prerequisite: Intelligence 10.

Benefit: Choose three 0-level arcane spells (cantrips). You may cast each of these spells once per day per your arcane spellcasting level (minimum 1). You are treated as a Mage for purposes of arcane spell failure chance when you are wearing armor.

Special: You may only take this feat as a 1st-level character.
