## Achilles Targeting Software (PL 8)


Any starship with a targeting system can have Achilles targeting software; the software does not take up one o f the starships
sensor system slots.


Achilles targeting software enables the ship to better train its weapons on an enemys critical systems. Achilles targeting software increases the critical threat ranges of the ships beam, projectile, and missile weapons by 1. This effect stacks with other systems that expand a weapons critical threat range, such as weapon batteries.


The purchase DC of Achilles targeting software depends on the size of the ship.


Purchase DC: 26 (Huge), 31 (Gargantuan), or 36 (Colossal).


Restriction: Restricted (+2).
