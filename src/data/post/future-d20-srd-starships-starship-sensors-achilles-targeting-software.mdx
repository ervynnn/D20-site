## Achilles Targeting Software (PL 8)


Any starship with a targeting system can have Achilles targeting software; the software does not take up one o f the starship's
sensor system slots.


Achilles targeting software enables the ship to better train its weapons on an enemy's critical systems. Achilles targeting software increases the critical threat ranges of the ship's beam, projectile, and missile weapons by 1. This effect stacks with other systems that expand a weapon's critical threat range, such as weapon batteries.


The purchase DC of Achilles targeting software depends on the size of the ship.


Purchase DC: 26 (Huge), 31 (Gargantuan), or 36 (Colossal).


Restriction: Restricted (+2).
