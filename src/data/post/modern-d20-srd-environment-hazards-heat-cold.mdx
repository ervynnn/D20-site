    Heat and Cold




    Heat and cold deal
    [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
    that cannot be recovered until the character counteracts or escapes the inclement temperature. As soon as the character suffers any damage from heat or cold, he or she is considered
    [fatigued](modern-d20-srd-conditions-index)
    .




    A character not properly equipped to counteract the heat or cold must attempt a Fortitude
    [saving  throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
each hour (DC 15, +1 for each previous check). Failure means that the character loses 1d4
[hit points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points)
. Heavy clothing or armor provides a –4 penalty on
[saves](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
against heat but grants a +4 equipment bonus on
[saves](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
against cold. A character who succeeds at a
[Survival](modern-d20-srd-skills-survival)
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index)
(DC 15) gains a +4 competence bonus on the save (see the
[Survival](modern-d20-srd-skills-survival)
skill).

    Searing heat or bitter cold (desert or arctic conditions) forces a character to make a
    [Fortitude  save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
every 10 minutes. Failure means that the character loses 1d6
[hit points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points)
. Appropriate clothing and successful use of the
[Survival](modern-d20-srd-skills-survival)
skill can modify the save, as noted above.
