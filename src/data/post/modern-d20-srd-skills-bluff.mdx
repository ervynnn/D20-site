## Bluff ([Cha](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores))

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): A Bluff
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) is opposed
by the target’s [Sense Motive](modern-d20-srd-skills-sense-motive)
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) when trying
to con or mislead. Favorable and unfavorable circumstances weigh heavily on
the outcome of a bluff. Two circumstances can work against the character: The
bluff is hard to believe, or the action that the bluff requires the target to
take goes against the target’s self-interest, nature, personality, or orders.

If it’s important, the GM can distinguish between a bluff that fails because
the target doesn’t believe it and one that fails because it asks too much of
the target. For instance, if the target gets a +10 bonus because the bluff
demands something risky of the target, and the target’s [Sense Motive](modern-d20-srd-skills-sense-motive) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) succeeds by 10 or less, then the target
didn’t so much see through the bluff as prove reluctant to go along with it.
If the target’s [Sense Motive](modern-d20-srd-skills-sense-motive)
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) succeeds by
11 or more, he has seen through the bluff, and would have succeeded in doing
so even if it had not placed any demand on him (that is, even without the +10
bonus).

A successful Bluff [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) indicates that the target reacts as the character wishes, at least for
a short time (usually 1 round or less), or the target believes something that
the character wants him or her to believe. A bluff requires interaction
between the character and the target. Targets unaware of the character can’t
be bluffed.

A bluff is not the same thing as a lie. A bluff is a quick prevarication
intended to distract, confuse, or mislead, generally only for the short term.
A bluff is not intended to withstand long-term or careful scrutiny, but rather
to momentarily deter an action or decision. Bluffs involve attitude and body
language. Bluffs often include lies, but they usually aren’t very
sophisticated and aren’t intended to deceive the target for more than a few
moments.

A lie, on the other hand, is a simple misrepresentation of the facts. Body
language and attitude aren’t a big part of communication. The lie may be very
sophisticated and well thought-out, and is intended to deceive a character at
least until he or she discovers evidence to the contrary. A character should
not make a Bluff check every time he or she utters a lie.

Feinting in [Combat](modern-d20-srd-combat-combat-cycle): A character can also
use Bluff to mislead an opponent in [combat](modern-d20-srd-combat-combat-cycle) so that the opponent can’t dodge the character’s
[attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) effectively. If the character
succeeds, the next attack the character makes against the target ignores his
or her [Dexterity bonus](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) to
[Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) (if the opponent has one), thus
lowering his or her [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) score. Using
Bluff in this way against a creature of animal intelligence
([Int](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) 1 or 2) requires a –8 penalty on
the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). Against
a nonintelligent creature, feinting is impossible.

Creating a Diversion to Hide: A character can use Bluff to help him or her
hide. A successful Bluff [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) gives the character the momentary diversion needed to attempt a
[Hide](modern-d20-srd-skills-hide) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) while people are aware of the character. (See the
[Hide](modern-d20-srd-skills-hide) skill)

Sending a Secret Message: A character can use Bluff to send and understand
secret messages while appearing to be speaking about other things. The DC for
a basic message is 10. Complex messages or messages trying to communicate new
information have DCs of 15 or 20. Both the sender and the receiver must make
the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) for the
secret message to be successfully relayed and understood.

Anyone listening in on a secret message can attempt a [Sense Motive](modern-d20-srd-skills-sense-motive) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC equal to the sender’s Bluff
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) result). If
successful, the eavesdropper realizes that a secret message is contained in
the communication. If the eavesdropper beats the DC by 5 or more, he or she
understands the secret message.

Whether trying to send or intercept a message, a failure by 5 or more points
means that one side or the other misinterprets the message in some fashion.

Try Again?: Generally, a failed Bluff [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) makes the target too suspicious for the
character to try another bluff in the same circumstances. For feinting in
[combat](modern-d20-srd-combat-combat-cycle), the character may try again
freely.

Special: A character can [take 10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) when making a bluff (except for feinting in combat), but
can’t [take 20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index). A
character with the [Deceptive](modern-d20-srd-feats-deceptive) feat gets a +2
bonus on all Bluff [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

Time: A bluff takes at least 1 round (and is at least a [full-round action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions)) but can take much longer if
the character tries something elaborate. Using Bluff as a feint in
[combat](modern-d20-srd-combat-combat-cycle) is an [attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions).
