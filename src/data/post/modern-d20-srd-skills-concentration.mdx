## Concentration ([Con](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores))

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): A character
makes a Concentration [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) whenever he or she may potentially be distracted while engaged in
some action that requires his or her full attention (such as making a [Disable Device](modern-d20-srd-skills-disable-device) or [Treat Injury](modern-d20-srd-skills-treat-injury) check). Situations such as taking
[damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage), working in a bouncing
[vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles), or dealing with severe
weather can require a character to make a Concentration
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

If the Concentration [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) succeeds, the character may continue with the action. If the
Concentration [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) fails, the action automatically fails (with the appropriate
ramifications, if any), and the action is wasted. A successful Concentration
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) still
doesn’t allow a character to [take 10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) when in a stressful situation; he or she must roll the
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) as normal.

The [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) DC
depends on the nature of the distraction.

Try Again?: Yes, though a success doesn’t cancel the effects of a previous
failure, such as the disruption of an action that was being concentrated on.

Special: A character can use Concentration to avoid [attacks of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity) when attempting a
skill check that normally provokes [attacks of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity). The DC to do so is 15.

If the Concentration [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) succeeds, the character may attempt the action normally without
incurring any [attacks of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity). If the Concentration [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) fails, the related check automatically fails just as if
the character’s concentration had been disrupted by a distraction. The
character does not provoke [attacks of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity), however.

This use of Concentration applies only to skill [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). It does not apply to other actions
that normally provoke [attacks of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity), such as [movement](modern-d20-srd-combat-movement-and-position) or making unarmed attacks.

A character with the [Focused](modern-d20-srd-feats-focused) feat gets a +2
bonus on all Concentration [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

The concentration skill has further uses for characters using
[magic](modern-d20-srd-fx-index) or [psionics](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index).

Time: Making a Concentration check doesn’t require an action; it is either a
reaction (when attempted in response to a distraction) or part of another
action (when attempted actively).
