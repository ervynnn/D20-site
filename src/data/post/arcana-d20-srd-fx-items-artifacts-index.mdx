##  Artifacts

Artifacts are wondrous items that are especially powerful, particularly
difficult to craft, or unique. They are ancient relics whose origins are
shrouded in mystery. Even the most powerful artificers cannot create
artifacts, for they are items whose power has grown through time. They are
true objects of legend and, in many cases, instigators or catalysts of world
change.
