## Ultralight Starship Subtypes

Ultralight ships cover most small spacecraft, including fighters, cutters, launches, and couriers.

An ultralight starship can be up to 250 feet long. It occupies a 250-foot-by-250-foot fighting space, and up to four ultralight starships can occupy a single 500-foot square. Due to their relatively small size, ultralight starships can form into wings (see Ultralight Starship Wings).

In addition, all ultralight starships share the following design specs.

Engines: All ultralight starships have thrusters. In addition, ships of PL 6 or higher have one other type of engine (see Starship Engines).

Armor: An ultralight ship has one type of armor (see Starship Armor).

Defensive Systems: An ultralight starship has a maximum of one defensive system per 3 Hit Dice (see Starship Defense Systems).

Sensors: An ultralight starship has a maximum of two sensor systems (see Starship Sensors).

Communications: An ultralight starship has a maximum of two external communication systems (see Starship Comm Systems).

Weapons: An ultralight starship has one beam, projectile, or missile weapon per 3 Hit Dice (see Starship Weapons). These weapons are often fire-linked. An ultralight ship cannot be armed with mines.

Grappling Systems: An ultralight starship may have up to two grappling systems (see Grappling Systems). Each grappling system takes away one of the ships weapon slots (see above).
