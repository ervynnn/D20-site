## Ultralight Starship Subtypes


Ultralight ships cover most small spacecraft, including fighters, cutters, launches, and couriers.


An ultralight starship can be up to 250 feet long. It occupies a 250-foot-by-250-foot fighting space, and up to four ultralight starships can occupy a single 500-foot square. Due to their relatively small size, ultralight starships can form into wings (see Ultralight Starship Wings).


In addition, all ultralight starships share the following design specs.


Engines: All ultralight starships have thrusters. In addition, ships of PL 6 or higher have one other type of engine (see Starship Engines).


Armor: An ultralight ship has one type of armor (see Starship Armor).


Defensive Systems: An ultralight starship has a maximum of one defensive system per 3 Hit Dice (see Starship Defense Systems).


Sensors: An ultralight starship has a maximum of two sensor systems (see Starship Sensors).


Communications: An ultralight starship has a maximum of two external communication systems (see Starship Comm Systems).


Weapons: An ultralight starship has one beam, projectile, or missile weapon per 3 Hit Dice (see Starship Weapons). These weapons are often fire-linked. An ultralight ship cannot be armed with mines.


Grappling Systems: An ultralight starship may have up to two grappling systems (see Grappling Systems). Each grappling system takes away one of the ship's weapon slots (see above).
