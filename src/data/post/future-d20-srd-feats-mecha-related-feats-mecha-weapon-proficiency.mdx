## Mecha Weapon Proficiency


You know how to acquire targets and fire your mecha’s weapons using onboard computers and sensors.


Prerequisite: Mecha Operation.


Benefit: You no longer suffer the standard penalties on attack rolls while you’re in your mecha. You can use any feats that refer to firearms with your ranged mecha weapons.


Normal: Characters without this feat take a –4 penalty on attack rolls made while in a mecha cockpit. Furthermore, they cannot apply firearm feats to a mecha’s ranged weapons.
