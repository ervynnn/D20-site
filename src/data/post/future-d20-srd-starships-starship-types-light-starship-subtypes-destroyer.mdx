## Destroyer (PL 6)

Destroyers take their name from the torpedo-boat destroyers of the late 19th century. They are integral to the defense of a task force, screening it against small craft and attack ships. Destroyers are often armed with one or two bombs or missiles useful against much larger ships. A destroyer is usually about 450 to 600 feet long and masses about 8,000 tons. It carries a crew of 150 to 200.
