## Anti-Accident System


Anti-accident systems use airbags, fire-retardant foam, no-skid brakes, gyroscopic stabilizers, and other safety features to improve a drivers chances of surviving or averting accidents.


The system reduces collision damage by half, though this only applies to the vehicle equipped with an anti-accident system.


Further, the operator of a vehicle so equipped gains a +2 equipment bonus on Drive or Pilot checks to make hard brake or hard turn maneuvers.


Purchase DC: 17.


Restriction: None.
