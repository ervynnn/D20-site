An arcane lock spell cast upon a door, cabinet, chest, or portal magically
locks it. The caster can freely pass his or her own lock without affecting it;
otherwise, a door or object secured with arcane lock can be opened only by
breaking in or by a successful [ dispel magic ](modern-d20-srd-fx-dispel-magic) or [ knock ](modern-d20-srd-fx-knock) spell. Add +10 to the normal DC
to break open a door or portal affected by this spell. Note that a [ knock](modern-d20-srd-fx-knock) spell does not remove an arcane lock. It only
suppresses it for 10 minutes. Material Component: Purchase DC 15.
