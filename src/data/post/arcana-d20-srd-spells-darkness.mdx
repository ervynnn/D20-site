## 
     Darkness
    



     Evocation [Darkness]
    



     Level: Divine 2; Components: V, DF; Casting Time: Attack action; Range: Touch; Target: Object touched; Duration: 10 minutes/level (D); Saving Throw: None; Spell Resistance: No
    



     This spell causes an object to radiate darkness out to a 20- foot radius. Not even creatures who can normally see in the dark (such as with darkvision) can see in an area shrouded in magical darkness. Normal lights (flashlights, candles, lanterns, and so forth) do not illuminate the darkened area, nor do light spells of lower level (such as light and dancing lights). Darkness and the 2nd-level spell daylight cancel each other, leaving whatever light conditions normally prevail in the overlapping areas of the spells.
    



     If the spell is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a lightproof covering, the spells effects are blocked until the covering is removed.
    



     Darkness counters or dispels any light spell of equal or lower level.
