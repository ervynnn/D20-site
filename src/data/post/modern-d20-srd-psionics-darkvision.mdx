##  Darkvision

[ Wisdom ](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)

Level: [ Battle Mind ](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-battle-mind) 2;
Display: Visual; Manifestation Time: [ Attack action ](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) ; Range: Touch; Target: Individual touched; Duration: 1

Power Point Cost: 3

The target gains the ability to see 60 feet even in total darkness. This
provides black-and-white vision only, but is otherwise like normal sight and
it doesn’t allow the target to see in magical darkness (if such a thing exists
in the campaign).
