## Repair (Int) Trained Only


[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): Most Repair [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) are made to fix complex electronic or mechanical devices. The DC is set by the GM. In general, simple repairs have a DC of 10 to 15 and require no more than a few minutes to accomplish. More complex repair work has a DC of 20 or higher and can require an hour or more to complete. Making repairs also involves a monetary cost when spare parts or new components are needed, represented by a [Wealth
  check](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check). If the GM decides this isnt necessary for the type of repair the character is attempting, then no [Wealth
  check](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check) is needed.


| Repair Task (Example) | Purchase DC | Repair DC | Time |
| :----------------------- | :-------------: | :-----------: | ------: |
| Simple (tool, simple weapon) | 4 | 10 | 1 min. |
| Moderate (mechanical or electronic component) | 7 | 15 | 10 min. |
| Complex (mechanical or electronic device) | 10 | 20 | 1 hr. |
| Advanced (cutting-edge mechanical or electronic device) | 13 | 25 | 10 hr. |




Jury-Rig: A character can choose to attempt jury-rigged, or temporary, repairs. Doing this reduces the purchase DC by 3 and the Repair [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) DC by 5, and allows the character to make the checks in as little as a [full-round](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions) action. However, a jury-rigged repair can only fix a single problem with a [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), and the temporary repair only lasts until the end of the current scene or encounter. The jury-rigged object must be fully repaired thereafter.



A character can also use jury-rig to hot-wire a car or jump-start an engine or electronic device. The DC for this is at least 15, and it can be higher depending on the presence of security devices.



The jury-rig application of the Repair skill can be used untrained.



Try Again?: Yes, though in some specific cases, the GM may decide that a failed Repair [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) has negative ramifications that prevent repeated [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).



Special: A character can [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) or [take 20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index) on a Repair [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). When making a Repair [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) to accomplish a jury-rig repair, a character cant [take
20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index).



Repair requires an [electrical
tool kit](modern-d20-srd-equipment-professional-equipment), a [mechanical
tool kit](modern-d20-srd-equipment-professional-equipment), or a [multipurpose
tool](modern-d20-srd-equipment-professional-equipment), depending on the task. If the character do not have the appropriate tools, he or she takes a 4 penalty on the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).



[Craft (mechanical)](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft-mechanical) or [Craft
(electronic)](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft-electronic) can provide a +2 [synergy
bonus](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-synergy-index) on Repair [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) made for mechanical or electronic devices (see [Skill
Synergy](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-synergy-index)).



A character with the [Gearhead](modern-d20-srd-feats-gearhead) feat and at least 1 rank in this skill gets a +2 bonus on all Repair [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).


Time: See the table for guidelines. A character can make a jury-rig repair
  as a [full-round action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions), but the work only lasts until the end of the current
  encounter.
