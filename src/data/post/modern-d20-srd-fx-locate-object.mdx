    The caster senses the direction of a well-known or clearly visualized object.  The caster can search for general items, in which case the caster locates the nearest one of its type if more than one is within range. Attempting to find a specific item requires a specific and accurate mental image; if the image is not close enough to the actual object, the spell fails. The caster cannot specify a unique object unless he or she has observed that particular item firsthand (not through divination).




    The spell is blocked by even a thin sheet of lead. Creatures cannot be found by this spell.
