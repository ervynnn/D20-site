##  Improved Natural Healing

You recover from wounds and injury faster than normal.

**Prerequisite:** Base Fortitude save bonus +5.

**Benefit:** You recover 2 hit points per character level per rest period (8
hours of sleep). If you undergo complete bed rest (doing nothing for the
entire day), you recover 4 hit points per character level per day. Ability
damage returns at 2 points for resting 8 hours, or 4 points per day with
complete bed rest.

Normal: Normal natural healing is 1 hit point per character level for 8 hours
rest, or 2 hit points per character level per day for complete bed rest.
Ability damage returns at 1 point for 8 hours rest, or 2 points per day with
complete bed rest.
