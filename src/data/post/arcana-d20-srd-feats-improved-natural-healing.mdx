## 
    Improved Natural Healing
   



    You recover from wounds and injury faster than normal.
   




     Prerequisite:
    
    Base Fortitude save bonus +5.
   




     Benefit:
    
    You recover 2 hit points per character level per rest period (8 hours of sleep). If you undergo complete bed rest (doing nothing for the entire day), you recover 4 hit points per character level per day. Ability damage returns at 2 points for resting 8 hours, or 4 points per day with complete bed rest.
   



    Normal: Normal natural healing is 1 hit point per character level for 8 hours rest, or 2 hit points per character level per day for complete bed rest. Ability damage returns at 1 point for 8 hours rest, or 2 points per day with complete bed rest.
