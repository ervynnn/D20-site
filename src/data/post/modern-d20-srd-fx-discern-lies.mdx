     Each round, the caster concentrates on one subject, who must be in range. The caster knows if the subject deliberately and knowingly speaks a lie. The spell does not reveal the truth, uncover unintentional inaccuracies, or necessarily reveal evasions. Each round, the caster may concentrate on a different subject.
