## Constrict (Ex)

The creature crushes the opponent, dealing bludgeoning damage, after making
a successful [grapple check](modern-d20-srd-combat-grapple). The amount of damage is given in the creature’s entry. If the
creature also has the [improved grab](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-improved-grab) ability, it deals constriction damage
in addition to damage dealt by the weapon used to grab.
