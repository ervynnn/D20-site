## Constrict (Ex)


The creature crushes the opponent, dealing bludgeoning damage, after making
	  a successful [grapple
    check](modern-d20-srd-combat-grapple). The amount of damage is given in the creatures entry. If the
    creature also has the [improved
    grab](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-improved-grab) ability, it deals constriction damage
    in addition to damage dealt by the weapon used to grab.
