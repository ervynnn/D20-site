## Starship Dodge


You are adept at dodging attacks while piloting starships.


Prerequisite: Dexterity 13, Pilot 6 ranks, Starship Operation (of the appropriate type).


Benefit: When piloting a starship of a type with which you are proficient (see the Starship Operation feat), you apply a +1 dodge bonus to your ship's Defense against attacks from one enemy starship you designate during your action. You can select a new enemy ship on any action.
