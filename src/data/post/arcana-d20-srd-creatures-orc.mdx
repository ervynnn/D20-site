     Orc




     Orcs read, write, and speak their own language (Orc). A few particularly intelligent orcs speak other local or Shadow languages, including Goblin and Giant.

###

     Species Traits




     Orcs have the following traits:




     Darkvision (Ex): Orcs can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and orcs can function with no light at all.




     Light Sensitivity (Ex): Orcs suffer a 1 penalty to attack rolls in bright sunlight or within the radius of effects or spells that duplicate bright sunlight (such as daylight).




     Bonus Feats: Orcs receive the bonus feats Archaic Weapons Proficiency, Armor Proficiency (light), and Armor Proficiency (medium). They may treat orc double axes as archaic weapons instead of exotic weapons.
