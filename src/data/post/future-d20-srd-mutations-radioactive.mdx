## Radioactive [MAJOR]

You are immune to some radiation and can emit bursts of harmful radiation from your body.

MP Cost: 5.

Benefits: You are immune to mild, low, and moderate degrees of radiation exposure. In addition, your body acts as a radiation battery, storing the energy for later use. Once per day as a free action, you may release a 60-foot-radius burst of radiation centered on you. All creatures within the burst radius are exposed to a moderate degree of radiation (Fortitude DC 18, incubation period 3d6 hours, initial and secondary damage 1d61 Con).
