### Longarms

Longarms are personal firearms that require two hands to be fired without penalty. This group includes hunting and sniping rifles, assault rifles, shotguns, and most submachine guns.

The basic longarm is the rifle, a group that includes both hunting rifles and sniper rifles. Most rifles are autoloaders, and they function internally in a manner very similar to autoloader pistols. Some models are operated manually, however, with the user having to work a bolt or lever between each shot. Assault rifles are rifles designed for military use and feature automatic as well as semiautomatic fire.

Shotguns are large-bore weapons that primarily fire shells full of small projectiles. They tend to be powerful, but only at short range. Reduce shotgun [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) by 1 point for every range increment of the attack.

Submachine guns are relatively compact longarms that generally fire pistol ammunition. They can fire on automatic.
All longarms are covered by the [Personal Firearms Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-personal-firearms-proficiency) feat.

Longarms are not well suited to close combat. A character takes a 4 penalty on the [attack roll](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) when firing at an adjacent target.

### AKM/AK-47

This assault rifle of the old Soviet Union is one of the most popular firearms in the world, having found common use in scores of bush wars and insurrectionson all sides of such conflicts. The AKM is a slightly more modern version of the AK-47, but functions essentially the same.
Barrett Light Fifty

The heavy but rugged Light Fifty is an incredibly powerful weapon for its size. Although its a sniper rifle, it fires a .50-caliber machine gun bullet, a round much more powerful than any other rifle ammunition.

### Benelli 121 M1

The Benelli 121 M1 semiautomatic shotgun is reliable, simple, and sturdy, with one of the fastest shotgun actions in the world. Many military and law enforcement agencies use this or similar weapons.

### Beretta M3P

Designed for police and security work, the M3P can fire either single shots or on semiautomatic. The M3P comes equipped with a tubular steel stock that folds over the top of the weapon to form a carrying handle, and its ammunition feeds from a box magazinean uncommon feature in a shotgun.

### Browning BPS

This heavy longarm fires the largest shotgun round available, the 10-gauge shell.

### HK G3

The G3 fires the powerful 7.62mm cartridge, a round used in many light machine guns but increasingly uncommon in assault rifles. At one time, over sixty of the worlds armies used this rifle.

### HK MP5

The Heckler & Koch MP5 family of weapons is among the most recognizable in the world. Many different designs exist; dexscribed here is the most basic model.

Due to its high quality of manufacture, the MP5 is always considered a [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) weapon. As such, it grants a +1 bonus on [attack rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll).
This weapon features a three-round burst setting. When used with the [Burst Fire](modern-d20-srd-feats-burst-fire) feat, it fires only three bullets instead of five and can be used with only three bullets in the weapon. This setting does not grant the ability to make burst fire attacks without the [Burst Fire](modern-d20-srd-feats-burst-fire) feat; if a character uses the setting without the feat, he or she makes a normal attack, and the extra two bullets are wasted.

### HK MP5K

A radically shortened version of the MP5, this weapon is optimized to be concealable. The steps taken to reduce the weapons size and weight negate the benefits of the parent weapons extraordinary quality, and as a result the MP5K is not a mastercraft weapon.

Although it comes with a 15-round magazine, the MP5K can also accept the same 30-round magazine as the MP5 (use of the larger magazine increases the weapons size to Large, though).

This weapon features a three-round burst setting. When used with the [Burst Fire](modern-d20-srd-feats-burst-fire) feat, it fires only three bullets instead of five and can be used with only three bullets in the weapon. This setting does not grant the ability to make burst fire attacks without the [Burst Fire](modern-d20-srd-feats-burst-fire) feat; if a character uses the setting without the feat, he or she makes a normal attack, and the extra two bullets are wasted.

### HK PSG1

This high-precision sniper rifle, based on the design of the HK G3, has a fully adjustable trigger and stock for individual users. The PSG1 comes with a standard scope.

Due to its high quality of manufacture, the PSG1 is always considered a mastercraft weapon. As such, it grants a +1 bonus on attack rolls.

### M16A2

Typical of the assault rifles used by militaries around the world, the Colt M16A2 is the current service rifle of the United States military, and is common with other armies and in the civilian world.

This weapon features a three-round burst setting. When used with the [Burst Fire](modern-d20-srd-feats-burst-fire) feat, it fires only three bullets instead of five and can be used with only three bullets in the weapon. This setting does not grant the ability to make burst fire attacks without the [Burst Fire](modern-d20-srd-feats-burst-fire) feat; if a character uses the setting without the feat, he or she makes a normal attack, and the extra two bullets are wasted.

### M4 Carbine

This is a cut-down version of the Colt M16A2, shortened by about a third by means of a telescoping stock and a shorter barrel.

### M-60

Introduced in the Vietnam War era, this medium machine gun is still in widespread use with the U.S. military and that of several other armies.

### Mossberg

The Mossberg Model 500 ATP6C is a pump-action shotgun designed for military and police work.

### Remington 700

A bolt-action rifle with a reputation for accuracy, the Remington 700 has been popular with hunters and target shooters since its introduction in the 1940s.

### Sawed-Off Shotgun

This is a 12-gauge, double-barreled shotgun with the stock and barrels sawed short. All thats left of the stock is a pistol grip, and the barrels are roughly 12 inches long. Sawed-off shotguns are generally illegal; most are homemade by cutting down a standard shotgun.

If this weapon if fully-loaded, a character can fire both barrels at once. The character receives a 2 penalty on the attack but deals +1 die of damage with a successful hit. Attacking this way uses both shotgun shells.

### Steyr AUG

An unusual and exotic-looking weapon, the bullpup AUG is the standard rifle of the Austrian and Australian armies. Its completely ambidextrous components make it equally convenient for left- and right-handed users, and it features a built-in optical sight.

This weapon features a three-round burst setting. When used with the [Burst Fire](modern-d20-srd-feats-burst-fire) feat, it fires only three bullets instead of five and can be used with only three bullets in the weapon. This setting does not grant the ability to make burst fire attacks without the [Burst Fire](modern-d20-srd-feats-burst-fire) feat; if a character uses the setting without the feat, he or she makes a normal attack, and the extra two bullets are wasted.

### Uzi

Designed in the 1950s for the Israeli army, the Uzi has become the most popular submachine gun in the world. It features a collapsible stock, making it extremely compact.

### Winchester 94

The Winchester Model 94 Big Bore is a lever-action rifle typical of big-bore hunting rifles found around the world.
