## Yeti

A yeti is a large, white-furred, human-shaped creature that stands about 8 feet tall and weighs approximately 300 pounds. Its long fur is heaviest around the head and shoulders, and its hands and feet are wide and flat. Layers of fat insulate its body, allowing it to survive and even thrive in subzero conditions. Although a yeti can stand and walk upright, it tends to hunch over and use its hands and feet, in the manner of a gorilla, to navigate ice floes and rocky terrain. Its eyes are either blue or colorless, and it has an extra pair of transparent eyelids that allow it to see even in blowing snow.

### Species Traits

Cold Subtype (Ex): A yeti is immune to cold damage. It takes 50% more damage from fire attacks.

Constrict (Ex): A yeti deals normal claw damage (treat as bludgeoning damage) plus 2d6 points of cold damage with a successful grapple check against a target at least one size category smaller than itself.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the yeti must hit an opponent at least one size category smaller than itself with its claw attack. If it gets a hold, it automatically deals claw damage each round that the hold is maintained, and it can constrict in the same round.

Skill Bonus: The yetis white fur grants it a +15 species bonus on Hide checks made in snowy conditions.
