## Moving

On his or her action, the driver moves the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) a number of squares that falls within the
[vehicle’s](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
[speed](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed) category.

Unlike characters, a [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
cannot [double move](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions),
[run](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions), or otherwise extend its
movement (except by changing to a higher [speed category](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-declaring-speed)).

Every [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) has a top speed,
included in its statistics on [Table: Vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles). A [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
cannot move more squares than its top speed. This means that some
[vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) cannot move at [all- out speed](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-declaring-speed), or
even [highway speed](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-declaring-speed).

Count squares for [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) just
as for characters. [Vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) can
move diagonally; remember that when moving diagonally, every second square
costs two squares’ worth of movement. Unlike with moving characters, a
[vehicle’s](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) facing is important;
unless it changes direction, a [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) always moves in the direction of its facing (or in the opposite
direction, if it’s moving in reverse).
