## 
    Cybernetic Dependency [DRAWBACK]
   



    Radiation exposure causes your body tissues to degenerate. You rely on a cybernetic implant to repair damage to your body.
   



    MP Value: 6.
   



    Drawback: You need a body repair weave (see Cybernetics) to heal naturally. For you, the body repair weave does not confer its usual benefit (improved natural healing). If the implant is destroyed, you cannot heal damage naturally until it is replaced or repaired.
   



    Special: This drawback is available only in Progress Level 7 or higher campaigns.
