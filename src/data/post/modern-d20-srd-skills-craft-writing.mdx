## Craft (Writing) (Int)

This skill allows a character to create short stories, novels, scripts and screenplays, newspaper articles and columns, and similar works of writing.

When creating a work of writing, the player simply makes a Craft (writing) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), the result of which determines the quality of the work.

No [Wealth check](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check) is necessary to use this Craft skill.

| Skill Check Result |    Effort Achieved |
| :----------------- | -----------------: |
| 9 or lower         | Untalented amateur |
| 10–19               |   Talented amateur |
| 20–24               |       Professional |
| 25–30               |             Expert |
| 31 or higher       |             Master |

Creating a work of writing requires at least 1 hour, but usually takes a day, a week, or more, depending on the scope of the project.

Special: A character with the [Creative](modern-d20-srd-feats-creative) feat gets a +2 bonus on all Craft (writing) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).
