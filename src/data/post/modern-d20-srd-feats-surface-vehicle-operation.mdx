## Surface Vehicle Operation

Select a class of surface vehicle (heavy wheeled, powerboat, sailboat, ship,
or tracked). The character is proficient at operating that class of vehicle.

The heavy wheeled class includes all kinds of semi-trucks and tractor-
trailers, as well as wheeled construction vehicles (such as earth movers) and
wheeled armored vehicles (such as some armored personnel carriers). Powerboats
are engine-powered water vessels designed for operation by a single person and
usually no more than 100 feet in length. Sailboats are wind-powered water
vessels. Ships are large, multicrewed water vessels. Tracked vehicles include
bulldozers and tanks and other military vehicles.

Prerequisite: [Drive](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive) 4 ranks.

Benefit: The character takes no penalty on [Drive](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) or
[attack rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) made when operating a
surface vehicle of the selected class.

Normal: Characters without this feat take a –4 penalty on
[Drive](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) made to operate a surface vehicle that falls
under any of these classes, and to attacks made with vehicle weapons. There is
no penalty when you operate a general-purpose surface vehicle.

Special: A character can gain this feat as many as five times. Each time the
character takes the feat, he or she selects a different class of surface
vehicle.
