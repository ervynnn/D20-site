## Invisiware (PL 8)


This technology enables its recipient to turn invisible for a short time. Invisiware uses crystalline refractors grafted to the skin and powered by rechargeable solar battery units protruding from various points on the recipient's body (usually the spine).


Benefit: By using invisiware to bend light around its body, a creature can turn invisible. An invisible creature gains a +40 bonus on Hide checks if immobile, or a +20 bonus if moving. Pinpointing the location of an invisible creature that isn't attempting to hide requires a Spot check (DC 40 if the creature is immobile or DC 20 if it is moving).


While invisible, the creature gains 50% concealment against attacks from other creatures that correctly pinpoint its fighting space.


Activating or deactivating invisiware is a free action. However, the technology consumes a great deal of the battery power; after 10 rounds (1 minute) of use, the
solar batteries must be recharged for 1 hour, during which time the invisiware cannot be activated.


Type: External.


Hardness/Hit Points: 4/20.
