### 
    Class Features
   



    The following features pertain to the Shadowjack advanced class.
   



    Read/Write Code
   

    Beginning at 1st level, the Shadowjack can understand both the nature of raw computer code and what the program is intended to accomplish when implemented. On
a successful Decipher Script check (DC 10 + Computer Use skill modifier of the codes author), the Shadowjack can determine both the function of the program and any bugs or potential weak points in the design. If weak points are found, the Shadowjack gains a +2 insight bonus on Computer Use checks attempting to degrade the program.
   



    Online Presence
   

    Beginning at 2nd level, when attempting to use a Charism-abased skill such a Bluff, Intimidate, Diplomacy, or Gather Information in an online situation, the Shadowjack adds any Shadowjack levels as a circumstance bonus.
   



    Bonus Feats
   

    At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Shadowjack gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Shadowjack must meet all of the prerequisites for the feat to select it. Alertness, Arcane Skills, Builder, Cautious, Educated, Gearhead, Lightning Reflexes, Low Profile, Meticulous, Renown, Studious, Windfall.
   



    Shadowjack Abilities
   

    Beginning at 4th level, the Shadowjack gains the following abilities:
   



    Electronic Empathy: The Shadowjack gains a +2 competence bonus when repairing or disabling electronic devices. This is in addition to any synergy bonuses for
related skills.
   



    Careful Progress: When the Shadowjack attempts to defeat computer security, the administrator is alerted only if the Shadowjack fails his Computer Use check by 10 or more. At 5th level, the Shadowjack gains the following abilities:
   



    False Trail: When covering his electronically tracks through the internet, the Shadowjack can lay in a false trail. With a successful DC 25 Computer Use check, the Shadowjack imposes a 5 penalty on any attempt to trace him (as described in the Defend Security function of the Computer Use skill). If the trace fails by 10 or more points, the tracker follows the Shadowjacks false trail to an innocent internet address. If the trace fails by less than 10 points, the tracker realizes the trail is bogus and gives up.
   



    Install Backdoor: After successfully breaking into a specific computer system, the Shadowjack can install a backdoor to the system. A backdoor is a piece of code that makes it easier for the Shadowjack to break into that particular system in the future. Writing and installing the program requires a Computer Use check (see chart below), but once successfully installed it automatically defeats that systems security upon return tripsthe Shadowjack no longer needs to make Computer Use checks to enter that system.
   


   Level of Security	DC
Minimum	25
Average	30
Exceptional	40
Maximum	45
   
    It is important to keep backdoors hidden from the system administrator, who will always be on the lookout for such invasions. A backdoor automatically allows the Shadowjack entrance to a particular system, but every time he uses it he must make an opposed Computer Use check against the administrator. Failure means
the backdoor is discovered and will be deleted before the next time the Shadowjack returns.
   



    At 7th level, the Shadowjack gains the following abilities:
   



    Online Spell Resistance: The Shadowjack becomes harder to hurt by spells and spell-like abilities sent through email and electronic devices, including the Techno Mages online spellcasting ability as well as magical items which use electronic components. The Shadowjack gains Spell Resistance equal to 10 + his Shadowjack levels. This is a supernatural ability.
   



    Improved Degradation: The Shadowjacks attempts to alter and degrade existing programming get more insidious. The degradation is installed as normal (as described in the Degrade Programming function of the Computer Use skill). However, unless the Computer Use check to fix the degraded program exceeds the DC by 5, the degradation returns within 6 hoursthis happens automatically, the Shadowjack does not have to make a second check.
   



    At 8th level, the Shadowjack gains the following abilities:
   



    Passfirewall: When the Shadowjack attempts to defeat computer security, the administrator is alerted only if the Shadowjack rolls a 1 on his Computer Use check.
   



    Walking Database: The Shadowjack gains the supernatural ability to recall vast amounts of information gleaned while traveling through cyberspace. He may spend an action point and then substitute his Computer Use score instead of a Knowledge score for the purposes of one check.
   



    Virtual Incantations
   

    At 10th level, the Shadowjack gains the spell-like ability to use a computer to cast incantations. This process reduces the number of secondary casters required by 10, and may allow the Shadowjack to shorten the casting time. If he is successful at a Computer Use check with a DC equal to the DC for the incantations skill check, the casting time is reduced to 1/10th of its original length. All other requirements for the incantation (components, saving throws, backlash, and so forth) remain the same.
