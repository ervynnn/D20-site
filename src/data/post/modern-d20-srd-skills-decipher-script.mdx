## Decipher Script ([Int](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)) [Trained Only](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics)

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): A character
can decipher writing in an ancient language or in code, or interpret the
meaning of an incomplete text. The base DC is 20 for the simplest messages, 25
for standard codes, and 30 or higher for intricate or complex codes or exotic
messages. Helpful texts or computer programs can provide a bonus (usually a +2
circumstance bonus) on the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), provided they are applicable to the script in
question.

If the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index)
succeeds, the character understands the general content of a piece of writing,
reading about one page of text or its equivalent in 1 minute. If the check
fails, the GM makes a [Wisdom check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics) (DC
10) for the character to see if he or she avoids drawing a false conclusion
about the text. (Success means that the character does not draw a false
conclusion; failure means that the character does.)

The GM secretly makes both the skill [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) and the [Wisdom check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics) so the character can’t tell whether the conclusion drawn is
accurate or not.

Try Again?: No, unless conditions change or new information is uncovered.

Special: A character can [take 10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) when making a Decipher Script [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), but can’t [take 20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index).

A character with the [Studious](modern-d20-srd-feats-studious) feat gets a +2
bonus on all Decipher Script [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

Time: Decipher Script takes 1 minute or more, depending on the complexity of
the code.
