     Class Features




     The following features pertain to the Artificer prestige class.




     Craft Artifice


     At each level of Artificer, choose one of the following item creation talents. The Artificer must have ranks in the appropriate Craft skill to use the talent. Note that for talents that are available to other arcane advanced classes, the Artificers version is less expensive.




     Craft Wand: With this talent, the Artificer can create wands, which carry spells within themselves. The Artificer can create a wand of any spell of 4th level or lower that he knows. Crafting a wand takes 12 hours x the spells level. When the Artificer creates a wand, he sets the caster level. The caster level must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than the Artificers total class levels in all arcane spellcasting classes (Artificer, Mage, Techno Mage). The caster level has an effect on the purchase DC of the raw materials to craft the wand, the skill check to create the wand, the experience point cost to craft the wand, and the DC of a saving throw (if applicable) to resist the effect of the wand.




     The purchase DC for the raw material that the Artificer requires to craft a wand is 18 + the level of the spell stored in the wand + the wands caster level.




     The Artificer must also spend experience points to craft a wand. The XP cost is equal to the spell level x the caster level x the purchase DC of the raw materials.




     Finally, the Artificer makes a Craft (mechanical) skill check. The DC for the check is 10 + the spell level + the caster level of the spell stored in the wand. If the check fails, the raw materials are used up but the XP are not spent. The Artificer can try crafting the wand again as soon as he purchases more raw materials.




     When an Artificer creates a wand, he makes any choices that he would normally make when casting the spell. A newly crafted wand has 50 charges.




     Any wand that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the raw materials cost, the Artificer must expend 50 copies of the material component or pay 50 times the XP cost when creating the wand.




     Improved Brew Potion: With this talent, the Artificer can create potions, which carry spells within themselves. The Artificer can create a potion of any spell of 3rd level or lower that he knows. The spell must target a character or characters. Brewing a potion takes 24 hours. When the Artificer creates a potion, he sets the caster level. The caster level must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than the Artificers total class levels in all arcane spellcasting classes (Artificer, Mage, Techno Mage). The caster level has an effect on the purchase DC of the raw materials to brew the potion, the skill check to create the potion, the experience point cost to brew the potion, and the DC of a saving throw (if applicable) to resist the effect of the potion. The purchase DC for the raw material that the Artificer requires to brew a potion is 12 + the potions spell level + the potions caster level. The Artificer must also spend experience points to brew a potion. The XP cost is equal to the spell level x the caster level x the purchase DC of the raw materials. Finally, the Artificer makes a Craft (chemical) skill check. The DC for the check is 10 + the spell level + the caster level of the potion. If the check fails, the raw materials are used up but the XP are not spent. The Artificer can try brewing the potion again as soon as he purchases more raw materials. When an Artificer creates a potion, he makes any choices that he would normally make when casting the spell. Whoever drinks the potion is the target of the spell. Any potion that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the raw materials cost, the Artificer must expend the material component or pay the XP when creating the potion.




     Improved Scribe Scroll: With this talent, the Artificer can create scrolls from which he or another spellcaster can cast a scribed spell. You can create a scroll of any spell you know. Scribing a scroll takes one day. The purchase DC for the raw materials to scribe a scroll is 10 + the scrolls spell level + the scrolls caster level.




     The Artificer must also spend experience points to scribe a scroll. The XP cost is equal to the spell level x the caster level x the purchase DC of the raw materials.




     Finally, the Artificer makes a Craft (writing) skill check. The DC for the check is 10 + the spell level + the caster level of the scroll. If the check fails, the raw materials are used up but the XP are not spent. The Artificer can try scribing the scroll again as soon as he purchases more raw materials.




     Any scroll that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the raw materials cost, the Artificer must expend the material component or pay the XP when scribing the scroll.




     A scroll can be written on a sheet of paper or parchment, or it can be saved as a file on a computer or PDA.




     Improved Scribe Tattoo: With this talent, an Artificer can create tattoos on his body or on someone elses. Tattoos function similarly to scrolls, and are created in the same way (see Scribe Scroll), except that the pertinent skill is Craft (visual arts). Magic Mastercraft: With this talent, the Artificer can create magical mastercraft items.




     Each time the Artificer selects this Craft Artifice talent, he applies it to either armor or weapons. From this point on, he can build magical mastercraft items of that type. The Artificer uses his Craft (mechanical) and Craft (chemical) to build weapons and armor and embue them with magical enhancements. On average, it takes twice as long to build a magic mastercraft item as it does an ordinary item of the same type. The cost to build a magic mastercraft item is equal to the purchase DC for the components (see the appropriate Craft skill description) + an additional amount based on the magical enhancement bonus: +1 bonus, +5 to the purchase DC; +2 bonus, +10 to the purchase DC; +3 bonus, +15 to the purchase DC. You can add the magic mastercraft feature to an existing ordinary item by making the Wealth check and then making the Craft check as though you were constructing the item from scratch. The Artificer must also spend experience points to create a magic mastercraft item. The XP cost is equal to the enhancement bonus x 10 x the purchase DC of the components. The XP must be paid before making the Craft checks. If the expenditure of these XP would drop the Artificer to below the minimum needed for his current level, then the XP cant be paid and the mastercraft work cant be done until the Artificer gains enough additional XP to remain at his current level after the expenditure is made. Finally, the Artificer makes a Craft (mechanical) skill check and a Craft (chemical) skill check to complete the work. The DC for the Craft (mechanical) check is 20 + the enhancement bonus for armor; 25 + the enhancement bonus for weapons. The DC for the Craft (chemical) check is 25 + the enhancement bonus  the Artificers class level.




     Bonus Feat


     At 2nd and 4th level, the Artificer gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Artificer must meet all of the prerequisites for the feat to select it.




     Empower Spell, Enlarge Spell, Eschew Materials, Extend Spell, Heighten Spell, Nonlethal Spell, Reach Spell, Sacred Spell, Shadowbane Spell.
