## Manipulators


Without some kind of manipulating appendage, robots cannot lift or move objects. Manipulators can be as crude as a simple probe or as complex as a five-fingered hand.


A Medium-size or smaller robot may have up to two functioning manipulators. Larger robots may be equipped with a greater number of functioning manipulators, as determined by their size:


| Robot's Frame Size | Manipulators |
| :-------------------- | --------------: |
| Medium-size or smaller | Up to 2 |
| Large | Up to 4 |
| Huge or larger | Up to 8 |



To build a manipulator from scratch, a character must succeed at a Craft (mechanical) check (DC 25) after investing 24 hours in its construction. A character without a mechanical tool kit takes a '4 penalty on the skill check. The character must also make a Wealth check against the manipulator's purchase DC. Mastercraft robot manipulators can be fashioned using the Mastercrafter feat.


Size: A manipulator, as an object, is usually two size categories smaller than the robot for which it's designed; for example, a hand designed for a Medium-size robot can be considered a Tiny object. A manipulator's size is usually important only for portability and concealment purposes.


Damage: Robots can use their manipulators as melee weapons, dealing piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage based on the type of manipulator and the robot's size (see Table: Manipulator Damage). Some types of manipulators deal nonlethal damage only.


Purchase DC: The cost of each manipulator. This cost is always a fraction of the base purchase DC of the robot's frame (see Frame, above).

### Claw (PL 5)


Claws resemble pincers, but the opposed surfaces cover the length of the appendage. Claws suffer the same handicaps as pincers when attempting tasks involving manual dexterity, but they deal greater damage.
Damage: Lethal slashing or nonlethal bludgeoning.
Purchase DC: 10 + one-quarter the base purchase DC of the robot's frame.


### Jaws (PL 5)


Only robots modeled after creatures with bite attacks have jaws. Robotic jaws are essentially large clamps with teeth.
Damage: Lethal piercing.
Purchase DC: 10 + one-quarter the base purchase DC of the robot's frame.


### Pincer (PL 5)


A pincer is a two-fingered, clawlike appendage that focuses all the grip strength on a pair of opposed surfaces, rather like a pair of tongs. Pincers allow the robot to manipulate and lift objects without much difficulty, but objects specifically made for humanoid hands (like firearms) are usually beyond the pincers' ability to operate. At the GM's discretion, tasks involving manual dexterity suffer a '4 penalty for a robot equipped with pincers.
Damage: Lethal piercing or nonlethal bludgeoning.
Purchase DC: 5 + one-quarter the base purchase DC of the robot's frame.


### Probe (PL 5)


Similar to a special-use gripper, a probe is simply an instrument of some kind, meant to measure torque, temperature, or some other factor. If the robot attempts to manipulate or lift an object with a probe, it takes a '4 penalty on the check.
Damage: Lethal piercing or nonlethal bludgeoning.
Purchase DC: 5 + one-tenth the base purchase DC of the robot's frame (rounded down).


### Special-Use Gripper (PL 5)


The robot has a manipulator designed for a specific task. When the robot uses a special-use gripper for a task other than its intended task, the robot suffers a '4 penalty on the check if the check involves manual strength or dexterity.
Damage: Nonlethal bludgeoning only.
Purchase DC: 5 + one-tenth the base purchase DC of the robot's frame (rounded down).


### Hand (PL 6)


A hand is a step up from a claw, in that it has more digits usually three or four, total. Hands are a bit more adaptable as well, imposing only a ' 2 penalty w hen attempting tasks involving manual dexterity.
Damage: Nonlethal bludgeoning only.
Purchase DC: 10 + one-quarter the base purchase DC of the robot's frame.


### Advanced Hand (PL 7)


Advanced hands are essentially the same in structure as human hands, though some might have additional fingers for specialized work. Advanced hands suffer no penalties when attempting tasks involving manual dexterity.
Damage: Nonlethal bludgeoning only.
Purchase DC: 10 + one-quarter the base purchase DC of the robot's frame.


### Task Hand (PL 7)


Task hands function just like advanced hands, except that they are equipped with additional joints and often with additional or telescoping digits, enabling them to multitask, as well as to spread the robot's grip strength over a slightly wider area.


A robot with a task hand gains a +1 equipment bonus on Climb, Craft, Demolitions, Disable Device, Drive, Escape Artist, Forgery, Pilot, Repair, Search, Sleight of Hand, and Treat Injury checks. This bonus improves to +2 if the robot has two or more task hands. At the GM's discretion, the robot can gain this bonus when attempting certain Perform checks as well.
Damage: Nonlethal bludgeoning only.
Purchase DC: 10 + one-quarter the base purchase DC of the robot's frame.
