## 
     Vivilor
    



     Vivilors are outsiders who come in response to the summon vivilor spell. Vivilors generally have humanoid shapes, but spellcasters can summon quadupedal or serpentine vivilors if they wish. In addition to their basic statistics, a summoner chooses additional special qualities from Vivilor Menu A or Vivilor Menu B (see below). A spellcaster can substitute two choices on Vivilor Menu A for one choice on Vivilor Menu B, or one choice on Vivilor Menu B for two choices on Vivilor Menu A.
    



     Vivilors do not speak. However, a vivilor can understand the instructions of its summoner and follows them to the letter.
