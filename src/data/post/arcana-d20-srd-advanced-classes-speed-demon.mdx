     Class Features




     The following features pertain to the Speed Demon advanced class.




     Uncanny Dodge X


     The Speed Demon gains the ability of Uncanny Dodge, or increases the potency of this ability if she already has it. If the Speed Demon does not have Uncanny

Dodge 1 (usually gained as a Fast hero), she gains Uncanny Dodge 1: She retains her Dexterity bonus to Defense (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by a hidden attacker. (She still loses her Dexterity bonus to Defense if shes immobilized.) If the Speed Demon already has Uncanny Dodge 1, she gains Uncanny Dodge 2: She can no longer be flanked; she can react to opponents on opposite sides of herself as easily as she can react to a single attacker.

     If the Speed Demon already has Uncanny Dodge 2, then she gains no further benefit from this ability.




     Hit the Weak Spot


     At 2nd level, the Speed Demon knows enough about vehicles to know the best way to damage and disable them. Whether using a weapon or another vehicle, the Speed Demon ignores the first 5 points of hardness when attacking a vehicle.




     Bonus Feats


     At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Speed Demon gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Speed Demon must meet all of the prerequisites for the feat to select it. Brawl, Builder, Dodge, Drive-By Attack, Force Stop, Gearhead, Improved Brawl, Renown, Streetfighting, Vehicle Dodge, Vehicle Specialization.




     Vehicle Empathy


     At 3rd level, the Speed Demon gains the supernatural ability to use Disable Device with a vehicle with which she has the Vehicle Specialization feat. This is a free action, but she must be touching the vehicle in question in order for the ability to function. This may include popping the locks without tools, starting the engine without keys, or cracking the engine block by touching the hood.




     Need For Speed


     At 4th level, the Speed Demon can improve the top speed of a ground or water vehicle that she controls. The vehicles top speed is increased by 25%.




     Nursing the Turns


     At 5th level, the Speed Demon can get better performance out of a vehicle, reducing some of its penalties. The Speed Demon may spend an action point to negate the Maneuver penalty of a vehicle or Initiative penalty of a vehicle she controls until the beginning of the Speed Demons next turn.




     Commandeer


     At 6th Level, the Speed Demon gains the supernatural ability to control a vehicle even if she is not behind the wheel or otherwise in immediate control of the vehicle. The Speed Demon makes all Drive checks for the vehicle as long as she is in control.




     The Speed Demon must be in contact with the vehicle, and loses control of it if she no longer maintains contact. The vehicle must be a vehicle with which the

Speed Demon has the Vehicle Specialization feat.

     The Speed Demon must make a Drive check for commandeering a vehicle. The DC is 10 for an otherwise uncontrolled vehicle or one in which the controller allows the Speed Demon to assume control. If the controller of the vehicle resists the Speed Demons attempts, the DC is 10 + the controllers Drive skill.




     eadfoot


     At 7th level, the Speed Demon gains a +2 competence bonus on initiative checks when controlling a vehicle.




     Redlining the Needle


     At 8th level, the Speed Demon treats Check/Roll Modifiers for All-Out and Highway Speeds as Street Speeds (reduced to 1 as opposed to 2 and 4, respectively).




     Restore Vehicle


     At 9th level, the Speed Demon gains the supernatural ability to, as a move action or part of a move action, restore a vehicle to working condition. The Speed Demon spends an action point and restores up to 10 points of damage to a vehicle she is in contact with. The restoration is magical in nature, and may be performed while the vehicle is in motion. The Speed Demon may restore damaged portions of the vehicle, such as tires, in the same manner.




     One with the Vehicle


     At 10th level, the Speed Demon develops supernatural reflexes behind the wheel, effectively reacting as if vehicle and body were one. When the Speed Demon is in control of a vehicle, she can add her Defense bonus to that of the vehicle. The Defense bonus applies to all parts of the vehicle, including windshields, tires, and passengers.
