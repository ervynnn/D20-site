## Haste

Transmutation

[Level](modern-d20-srd-fx-level): [Mage](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-mage)
3; [Components](modern-d20-srd-fx-components): V, S, M; [Casting Time](modern-d20-srd-fx-casting-time); [Attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) [Range](modern-d20-srd-fx-range): Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2
levels); [Target](modern-d20-srd-fx-target): One creature;
[Duration](modern-d20-srd-fx-duration): 1 round/level; [Saving Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): Fortitude negates (harmless);
[Spell Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance): Yes
(harmless)

The transmuted creature moves and acts more quickly than normal. This extra
speed has several effects.

When making a [full attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions),
the subject may make one extra [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll)
with any weapon he or she is holding. The attack is made using the character’s
full [base attack bonus](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll), plus any
modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This benefit does not actually grant
an extra action, so a character can’t use it to cast a second spell or
otherwise take an extra action in the round.)

The subject gains a +2 dodge bonus to [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense). Any condition that makes the subject lose his or her
[Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) bonus to
[Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) (if any) also makes the subject lose
dodge bonuses.

All of the subject’s modes of movement (including normal movement, burrow,
climb, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet (to a maximum of double the
subject’s normal speed).

Haste dispels and counters [slow](modern-d20-srd-fx-slow).
