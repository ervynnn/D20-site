## 
    Damage Control, Advanced (PL 8)
   



    A starship equipped with advanced damage control regains an additional +2d10 points of damage each time damage control is performed successfully (see Damage Control System, above). Advanced damage control replaces (and does not stack with) improved damage control.
   



    Purchase DC: 10 + the purchase DC of a standard damage control system.
   



    Restriction: Military (+3).
