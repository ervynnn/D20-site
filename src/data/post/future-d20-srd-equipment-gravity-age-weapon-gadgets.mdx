## 
    Gravity Age Weapon Gadgets
   



    The following gadgets are found in the Gravity Age and can apply to weapons of that era or later, provided all gadget-specific restrictions are observed.
   


### 
    Sound Suppressor
   



    Similar to the technology that produced the silent suit, the sound suppressor gadget is the Gravity Age replacement for the silencers of the modern era. Since energy weapons cannot make use of the traditional silencers found on most ballistic weapons, the sound suppressor takes over this function with almost all Gravity Age weapons.
   



    The sound suppressor generates a field of sonic energy that cancels sound produced within field, reducing weapon firing noise to a mere whine of sonic energy discharge. The sound suppressor adds +10 to the DC of Listen checks made to hear the weapon firing.
