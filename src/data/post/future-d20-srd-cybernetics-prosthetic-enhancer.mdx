## Prosthetic Enhancer (PL 7)

This implant attaches to a prosthetic arm or leg, making it stronger.

Benefit: If attached to a prosthetic leg, the prosthetic enhancer increases the recipients base speed by +5 feet. In addition, any unarmed attack made with an enhanced prosthetic leg deals an additional 1 point of damage.

If attached to a prosthetic arm, the prosthetic enhancer grants a +2 bonus on Strength- and Dexterity-based ability checks and skill checks. In addition, any unarmed attack made with an enhanced prosthetic arm deals an additional 1 point of damage.

A prosthetic enhancer does not count toward the total number of cybernetic attachments the recipient can have before taking negative levels (see Number of Attachments).
