## Power Resistance (Ex)

A creature with power resistance can avoid the effects of [psionic powers](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index) that directly affect it. To determine whether a [spell](modern-d20-srd-fx-index) or spell-like ability works, the [psionic power](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index) manifester must make a level check (1d20 + manifesters level). If the result equals or exceeds the creatures power resistance, the power works normally, although the creature is still allowed a [saving throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws).
