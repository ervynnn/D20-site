### Avenger Electro-Scimitar (PL 8)


The Avenger electro-scimitar is a lightweight and efficient one-handed melee weapon. As a mastercraft item, it grants a +1 bonus on attack rolls.


Damage for the energy scimitar is based on the size of the mecha wielding it: Large 4d6, Huge 8d6, Gargantuan 12d6, and Colossal 16d6. The energy scimitar has a critical threat range of 18'20. Half of the damage the energy sword deals is slashing damage, and the other half is electricity damage.


The electro-scimitar's size category is the same as the mecha's size category.

Saving Throw: None.
Purchase DC: 15 + one-quarter the mecha's base purchase DC.

### LT-5 Longshot Mass Driver (PL 8)


Mass drivers fire hyper-accelerated spent-uranium slugs at the target, dealing damage strictly through the massive kinetic energy the round imparts to the target. A mass driver round deals 15d6 points of ballistic damage, and the system's magazine holds 10 rounds. Each 10-round magazine has a purchase DC of 12.



Equipment Slots: 2 for weapon, including hand (or arm if Large), arm, or shoulders; 1 for each 10-round ammo bay.

### RP-91 Reaper Laser Scythe (PL 8)


The RP-91 Reaper is a two-handed melee weapon with a crystal carbon shaft housing laser and magnetic field generators. When activated by the mecha operator, it suspends a laser beam within a razor-thin magnetic envelope shaped like a farmer's scythe. As a mastercraft item, it grants a +1 bonus on attack rolls.


Damage with a successful melee attack depends on the size of the wielding mecha: Large 4d10, Huge 6d10, Gargantuan 8d10, and Colossal 10d10. On a successful critical hit, the damage is quadrupled. Half of the damage the energy sword deals is slashing damage, and the other half is fire damage. The mecha applies one and one-half times its Strength bonus on damage rolls when wielding the weapon.


The laser scythe's size category is one size category larger than the mecha's size category, up to a maximum size of Colossal.

Activation: Attack action.
Range: Touch.
Target: Single target within reach.
