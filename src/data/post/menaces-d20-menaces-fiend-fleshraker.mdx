## 
     Fleshraker (Knife Fiend)
    



     Bonus Feat: A fleshraker gains Archaic Weapons Proficiency as a bonus feat.
    



     Damage Reduction 10/Ballistic (Ex): A fleshraker ignores the first 10 points of damage dealt by any nonballistic weapon.
    



     Death Hunger (Ex): A fleshraker that goes 24 hours without killing a human suffers 1d4 points of Constitution damage. This damage cannot be restored until the fleshraker kills a human, at which point the ability damage heals normally.
    



     Fire Resistance 20 (Ex): A fleshraker ignores the first 20 points of damage from any attack that deals fire damage.
    



     Immunities (Ex): A fleshraker is immune to slashing and piercing weapons.
    



     Wounding Weapon (Su): Any slashing weapon wielded by a fleshraker can inflict terrible wounds that bleed profusely. In addition to the normal damage the weapon deals, the target takes 1 point of damage that round and each subsequent round from bleeding. Multiple wounds from a wounding weapon result in cumulative bleeding loss (two wounds for 2 points of damage per round, and so on). A successful Treat Injury check (DC 15) or the application of any cure spell stops the bleeding. The weapon does not retain this ability outside the grasp of a knife fiend, although any bleeding wounds it has inflicted continue to bleed if the fleshraker is disarmed.
