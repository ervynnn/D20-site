## Defense


A starships Defense represents how difficult it is to hit in combat. Its the attack roll result that an enemy ship needs to achieve a hit. In general, starships are easy to hit, which is why they rely on armor to absorb damage (see Starship Armor, below).


A starships Defense is partly determined by the skill of the pilot or the quality of its automatic pilot system.


### Piloted Ships


A starship with a living pilot has a Defense equal to:


10 + starships size modifier + pilots class bonus to Defense + pilots Dexterity modifier


Starships Size Modifier: The bigger a starship is, the easier it is to hit in combat. The smaller it is, the harder it is to hit. Size modifiers are shown on Table: Starship Sizes.


Pilots Class Bonus to Defense: The pilot imparts her class bonus to Defense to the ships Defense. This bonus applies even if the starship is flat-footed or otherwise denied the pilots Dexterity bonus to its Defense.


All starship pilots are assumed to have the appropriate Starship Operation feat. Consequently, they apply their full class bonus to Defense (instead of one-half the modifier) to a starships Defense.


Pilots Dexterity Modifier: In any given round, a pilot may choose to transfer her full Dexterity bonus to the starships Defense. However, doing so forces the pilot to focus entirely on flying the ship, and consequently the pilot loses the Dexterity bonus to her own Defense for the round.


A pilot cannot apply her Dexterity bonus to a starships Defense if she or the starship is flat-footed.


### Autopiloted Ships


Every starship comes equipped with a basic autopilot system that enables it to dodge enemy fire without need for a pilot. A starship on autopilot has a Defense equal to:


10 + starships size modifier + autopilot systems equipment bonus


Starships Size Modifier: Size modifiers are shown on Table: Starship Sizes.


Autopilot Systems Equipment Bonus: An autopilot system provides an equipment bonus to Defense depending on the ships size: Huge +1, Gargantuan +2, Colossal +3. A ship equipped with an improved autopilot system (see Starship Defense Systems) gains a higher bonus.
