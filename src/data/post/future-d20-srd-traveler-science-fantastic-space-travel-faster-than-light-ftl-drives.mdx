## Faster-Than-Light (FTL) Drives


Early in Progress Level 7, the development of artificial gravity technology spawns the induction engine, and scientists quickly learn to apply the technology to faster-than-light travel. The early stardrives are not truly capable of reaching light speed but offer a vast improvement over conventional engines. Humanity can finally reach distant stars in mere weeks, advancing space exploration and colonization, as well as reaching out to contact and trade with intelligent alien life.


Table: Faster-Than-Light (FTL) Drives shows the relativistic cruising speeds of various FTL engines.
