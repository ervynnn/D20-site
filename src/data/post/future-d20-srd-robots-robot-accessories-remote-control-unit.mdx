## Remote Control Unit (PL 5)

Referred to colloquially as a remcon, this handheld, self-powered control stick has a small video screen and audio receiver built into it. It also comes in the form of a mechanical gauntlet worn on the hand.

The remcon allows its operator to control a specific robot from afar. For it to work, the robot must be equipped with an AV transmitter and a robolink adjusted to the same frequency as the remote control unit.

Using a remcon to activate or deactivate a robot is an attack or move action. Using it to make the robot move, attack, or use a skill is a full-round action for the operator.

Purchase DC: 15.

Restriction: None.
