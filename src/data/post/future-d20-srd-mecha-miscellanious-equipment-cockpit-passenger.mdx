## Cockpit, Passenger (PL 5)

This extra cockpit merely provides a comfortable place inside the mecha for a Small or Medium-size passenger to sit. The passenger cant do anything other than observe the surroundings (seeing exactly what the mechas operator sees), communicate privately with the operator and publicly over open frequencies, and leave the cockpit as a full-round action. As a move action, the operator can prevent any of the above by shutting off the cameras, locking the hatch, and so on.
