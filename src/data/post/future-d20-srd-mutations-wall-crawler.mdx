## 
    Wall Crawler [MINOR]
   



    You can walk walls and cling to ceilings like a spider. You have tiny barbs on your hands and feet to facilitate climbing, and your fingers and toes secrete a transparent adhesive that lets you cling to smooth surfaces.
   



    MP Cost: 2.
   



    Benefits: As long as your hands and feet are uncovered, you can climb perfectly smooth, flat, vertical surfaces. In addition, you gain a +4 mutation bonus on all Climb checks. Wearing gloves or footwear reduces the bonus to +2, and wearing both gloves and footwear negates the bonus entirely.
   



    You also gain a +4 mutation bonus on Balance checks when moving a cross a slippery surface. Wearing any kind of footwear negates this bonus.
