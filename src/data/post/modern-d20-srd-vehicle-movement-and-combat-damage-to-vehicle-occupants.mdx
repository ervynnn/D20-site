     Damage to Vehicle Occupants




     When a
     [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
     takes
     [damage](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-resolving-collisions)
     from a
     [collision](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming)
     , its occupants may take
     [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
     as well. The base amount of
     [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
     depends on the
     [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover)
     offered by the
     [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
     .

| [Cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover) | [Damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) |
| :------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------: |
| None | Same as
[damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
taken by
[vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) |
| One-quarter | One-half
[damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
taken by
[vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) |
| One-half | One-quarter
[damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
taken by
[vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) |
| Three-quarters or more | None |

     Each of the occupants may make a
     [Reflex  save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
(DC 15) to take half damage.
