## 
     Create Clone
    



     Necromancy
    



     Skill Check: Knowledge (arcane lore) DC 32, 7 successes, and Knowledge (earth and life sciences) DC 32, 1 success; Failure: Two consecutive failed skill checks; Components: V, S, M, F, XP; Casting Time: 8 hours (minimum) and see text; Range: Touch; Effect: One clone; Duration: Instantaneous; Saving Throw: None; Spell Resistance: No
    



     This incantation makes an inert duplicate of a creature. If the original individual has been slain, the originals soul transfers to the clone, creating a replacement. The originals physical remains, should they still exist, become inert matter and cannot thereafter be restored to life.
    



     To create the duplicate, you must have a piece of flesh (not hair, nails, scales, or the like) taken from the originals living body, with a volume of at least 1 cubic inch. The piece of flesh need not be fresh, but it must be kept from rotting (through periodic applications of cure minor wounds or more advanced medical means). Prior to the incantation being cast, the duplicate body must be grown in a laboratory for 2d4 months.
    



     When the clone is completed, if the original is dead, the originals soul enters the clone. The clone has the personality, memories, skills, and levels the original had at the time the piece of flesh was taken. However, the replacement must be at least one level lower than the original was at the time of death. If the original was 1st level, the clones Constitution score drops by 1; if this would give the clone a Constitution score of 0, the incantation fails. If the original creature has lost levels since the flesh sample was taken and died at a lower level than the clone would otherwise be, the clone is at the level at which the original died.
    



     The spell duplicates only the originals body and mind, not its equipment.
    



     A duplicate can be grown while the original still lives, or when the original soul is somehow unavailable, but the resulting creature is merely a soulless bit of inert flesh, which rots if not somehow preserved.
    



     Material Component: The piece of flesh and various laboratory supplies (purchase DC 25).
    



     Focus: Genetics laboratory (purchase DC 30).
    



     Experience Point Cost: 500 XP.
    



     Failure: Betrayal, and possibly reversal as well. If the caster and cloned creature were allies or neutral toward one another, then the cloned creature gains allegiances opposite the ones it once had. If the caster and cloned creature were enemies, then each one gains the allegiances the other one had (although neither one knows the other has new allegiances).
