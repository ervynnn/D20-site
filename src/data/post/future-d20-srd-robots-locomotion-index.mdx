## 
     Locomotion
    



     How a robot moves is determined by its means locomotion. Most robots have only one means of locomotion, each of which comes with its own advantages and disadvantages, as shown below.
    



     To build a mode of locomotion from scratch, a character must succeed at a Craft (mechanical) check (DC 25) after investing 24 hours in its construction. A character without a mechanical tool kit takes a '4 penalty on the skill check. The character must also make a Wealth check against the purchase DC for the given mode of locomotion.
    



     Base Speed: Each mode of locomotion has a base speed. This speed can be improved, but each 5-foot increase in speed also increases the purchase DC by +1. The base speed can never be increased more than double the listed amount.
    



     Purchase DC: The cost of the components necessary to grant the robot this particular mode of locomotion. This cost is always a fraction of the base purchase DC of the robot's frame (see Frame, above).
