## 
     Mindwreckers
    



     The mundane world is not quite sure how to treat this organization. On the one hand, it is a radical group that regularly is involved in disturbing the peace, assault, torture, and even extremely violent terrorist activities. On the other hand, they do it all in the name of freedom of the mind, and claim to be psychic warriors and the worlds elite psionicists.
    



     The Mindwreckers believe that mental powers are the worlds most avant-garde art form, and that they should be left alone to allow their artistry to flourish. However, their artistry seems to focus mainly on hurting innocent people and destroying public and private property. They believe that anyone who does not have mental powers is merely clay or canvas to be molded by a skilled craftsperson. Often they videotape their criminal activities to add to their portfolios. Whats more, they brand anyone whom they believe to have psychic abilities yet opposes their activities a mindcriminal, and target that person and his or her family, business, and property for especially destructive performances.
    



     Whether these are a bunch of extremely violent, delusional delinquents or actually a psionic terrorist group depends entirely on the GMs perspective on psionics in the campaign. Either way, the Mindwreckers are a dangerous organization of extremists who live to cause mayhem in the lives of the people they call little brains. As such, the Mindwreckers is not and organization that any hero should even consider joining.
    



     The Mindwreckers love publicity, but they hate when unexpected witnesses ruin their performances by taking information to the authorities. As a result, the group has pioneered a new psionic power that allows them to block the memories of anyone whose lips they want to seal temporarily. Members of the Mindwreckers have access to the following psionic power:
    



     Memory Block
    

     Charisma
    



     Level: Telepath 4; Display: Visual, Audible; Manifestation Time: 1 action; Range: Touch; Target: One living creature; Duration: 1 day + 1 hour/level; Saving Throw: Will negates; Power Resistance: Yes; Power Points: 10
    



     You form a psionic barrier within the targets memory, creating near total amnesia. The target cannot remember his name or any pertinent facts about his life. It has no effect on his ability to form new memories.
    



     Memory block has no effect on the targets physical skills and abilities; through instinct, he is able to do everything he was before. GMs may require an Intelligence check (DC 15 + assailants Telepath level) before allowing a character to use particularly complex pieces of equipment.
    



     For the duration of the memory block, victims cannot perform any Knowledge checks and have a penalty to any Research checks equal to the Telepath level of the character who manifested this effect.
