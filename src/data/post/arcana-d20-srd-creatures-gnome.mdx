##  Gnome

Gnomes speak their own language, Gnome. They usually take the time to learn
one or more local languages as well. Particularly bright gnomes may know
additional Shadow languages, including Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Giant,
Goblin, and Orc.

###  Species Traits

Gnomes have the following traits:

Special Combat Bonuses: Gnomes gain a +1 species bonus on attack rolls against
bugbears, goblins (and other goblinoids), and kobolds. Gnomes also gain a +4
dodge bonus to their Defense against giant-type creatures (such as ogres and
trolls); this bonus represents special training that gnomes undergo, during
which they learn tricks that previous generations developed in their battles
with giants. Note that any time a gnome loses his positive Dexterity bonus to
Defense, such as when he’s caught flat-footed, he loses this dodge bonus, too.

Illusion Mastery: Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against
Illusion spells cast by gnomes.

Speak with Animals (Sp): Once per day, a gnome can use speak with animals as a
spell-like ability to speak with a burrowing mammal (a mole, gopher, ground
hog, and so forth). It has a duration of 1 minute, and the gnome is considered
a 1st-level caster when he uses this ability, regardless of his actual level.
Low-Light Vision (Ex): Gnomes can see twice as far as a human in starlight,
moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. They
retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.

Saving Throw Bonus: Gnomes gain a +2 species bonus on saving throws against
illusions.

Skill Bonuses: Gnomes gain a +2 species bonus on Listen checks. Gnomes who
have one or more ranks in the Craft (pharmaceutical) skill also gain a +2
species bonus on Craft (pharmaceutical) checks.

Bonus Feats: Gnomes gain the bonus feat Archaic Weapons Proficiency. They may
treat gnome hooked hammers as archaic weapons instead of exotic weapons.
Gnomes with Charisma scores of 10 or higher gain the bonus feat Magical
Heritage.
