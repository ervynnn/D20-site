## Attack Roll


An attack roll represents one starship’s attempt to strike another on its turn in a round. Most starships are armed with ranged weapons aimed by gunners.
When a starship makes an attack roll, roll 1d20 and add the appropriate modifiers (described below). If the result equals or beats the target’s Defense, the attack hits and deals damage. A starship’s attack roll is:


1d20 + gunner’s ranged attack bonus + range penalty + starship’s size modifier + targeting system’s equipment bonus


Gunner’s Ranged Attack Bonus: Unless noted otherwise, all starship gunners are assumed to have the Starship Gunnery feat. Without this feat, a starship gunner takes a –4 nonproficient penalty on attack rolls with starship weapons.


For simplicity, all gunners aboard a starship have identical ranged attack bonuses.


Range Penalty: The range penalty for a ranged weapon depends on what weapon the starship is using and the distance to the target. All ranged weapons have a range increment, as noted in Table: Starship Weapons.


As with character weapons, any attack from a distance of less than one range increment is not penalized for range. However, each full range increment causes a cumulative –2 penalty on the attack roll.


A beam weapon has a maximum range of 10 increments. A projectile weapon has an unlimited range, since projectiles don’t lose inertia in space.
Starship’s Size Modifier: Starships are Huge, Gargantuan, or Colossal in size. Table: Starship Sizes notes the size modifiers for ships of different sizes.
Targeting System’s Equipment Bonus: Most starships have computerized targeting systems to help gunners train weapons on targets. A standard targeting system provides an equipment bonus on the gunner’s attack roll depending on the ship’s size: Huge +1, Gargantuan +2, Colossal +3. Improved targeting systems (see Starship Sensors) grant higher bonuses. Table: Starship Sizes summarizes the targeting system equipment bonuses for ships of different sizes.


Automatic Misses and Hits: As in character combat, a natural 1 on the attack roll is always a miss. A natural 20 is always a hit. A natural 20 also always threatens a critical hit (see Critical Hits, below).


| Table: Starship Sizes |  |  |  |  |  |
| :----------------------- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | --: |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Colossal | –8 | +3 | +3 | 64 ft. or more | 250,000 lb. or more |
| Gargantuan | –4 | +2 | +2 | 32–64 ft. | 32,000–250,000 lb. |
| Huge | –2 | +1 | +1 | Less than 32 ft. 4 | ,000–32,000 lb. |
| 1A starship applies its size modifier on all attack rolls and to its Defense.
2 A starship applies its targeting system’s equipment bonus on all attack rolls.
3 A starship on autopilot applies its autopilot system’s equipment bonus to its Defense. |  |  |  |  |  |
