## 
    Vexing Voice [MAJOR]
   



    You can vex another creature using the peculiar resonance of your voice.
   



    MP Cost: 4.
   



    Benefit: Select any living creature within 30 feet of you as the target; the creature must be able to hear your voice to be affected. Upon hearing your voice, the creature must make a successful Will save (DC 10 + one-half your level + your Charisma modifier) or be dazed for 1 round. A successful save negates the effect. This ability is a mind-affecting compulsion usable three times per day. Using this ability is a free action.
