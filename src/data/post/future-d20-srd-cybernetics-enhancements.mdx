## Enhancements


Cybernetic enhancements are available starting at Progress Level 6. Unlike standard replacements, they bestow new abilities upon their recipients. Unless otherwise noted, enhancements dont add measurably to a recipients weight.


Each enhancement description includes the following information:


Benefit: What the cybernetic enhancement allows its recipient to do.


Type: Enhancements can be external or internal. External enhancements are subject to sunder attacks; internal enhancements are not.


Hardness/Hit Points: The hardness and hit points of the enhancement. Internal enhancements dont have hardness.


Base Purchase DC: The purchase DC of the enhancement (or the components to build it), at its specified Progress Level. Cybernetic attachments are cheaper to buy at higher Progress Levels; for each raised step in Progress Level, reduce the purchase DC by 2.


Restriction: The level of license required to purchase the enhancement legally, and an appropriate black market purchase DC modifier.
