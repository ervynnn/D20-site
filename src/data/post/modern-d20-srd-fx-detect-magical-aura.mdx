The caster can detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how long the caster studies a particular area or subject.

1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras.

2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the strength of the strongest aura.

3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura.

Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may confuse or conceal weaker auras.

Aura Strength: An auras magical power and strength depend on a spells functioning spell level or an items caster level.

| Functioning Spell Level   | Item Caster Level |   Aura Power |
| :------------------------ | :---------------: | -----------: |
| 0-level or lingering aura |  Lingering aura   |          Dim |
| 1st2nd                    |      1st3rd       |        Faint |
| 3rd                       |      4th5th       |     Moderate |
| 4th                       |      6th7th       |       Strong |
| 5th                       |      8th10th      | Overwhelming |

If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magical aura indicates the stronger of the two.

Length Aura Lingers: How long a magical aura lingers after the source has
vacated the location depends on the auras original strength.

| Original Strength |         Duration |
| :---------------- | ---------------: |
| Faint             |      1d6 minutes |
| Moderate          | 1d6 x 10 minutes |
| Strong            |        1d6 hours |
| Overwhelming      |         1d6 days |

Each round, the caster can turn to detect things in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
