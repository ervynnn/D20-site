## Levitate

[Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)

Level: [Telepath](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-telepath) 2; Display: Olfactory; Manifestation Time: [Attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions); Range: Personal or close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels); Target: You or one willing creature or one object (total weight up to 100 lb./level); Duration: 10 minutes/level (D); [Saving Throw](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-power-resistance): None; Power Resistance: No; Power Point Cost: 3

Levitate allows the manifester to move him or herself, another creature, or an object up and down as the manifester wishes. A creature must be willing to be levitated, and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature. The manifester can mentally direct the recipient to move up or down up to 20 feet each round; doing so is a move action. The manifester cant move the recipient horizontally, but the subject could push or pull his or her way provided there is a surface to grasp (generally at half its base speed). A levitating creature who [attacks](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) with a [melee or ranged weapon](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-weapons) finds him or herself increasingly unstable; the first [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) has an [attack roll](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) penalty of 1, the second 2, and so on, up to a maximum penalty of 5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at 1.
