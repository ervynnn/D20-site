[Future D20 SRD]( / ) > Robots




## Rotor (PL 5)


The robot is equipped with a rotor, like a helicopter's. It doesn't move as quickly as a robot equipped with an air propeller, but it can hover without falling.


Base Speed: Fly 30 feet (poor).


Purchase DC: One-quarter the base purchase DC of the robot's frame.
