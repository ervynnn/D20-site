## 
    Particle Field (PL 7)
   



    Generators project a field of alpha particles (helium nuclei that have been stripped of their electrons) around the ship. The field absorbs energy damage; weapons that wholly or partly deal concussion, electricity, fire, or nonspecific energy damage (such as beam weapons) fired at the starship take a '4 penalty on attack rolls.
   



    A mine can be equipped with a particle field.
   



    Purchase DC: 10 + one-half the base purchase DC of the starship or mine.
   



    Restriction: Military (+3).
