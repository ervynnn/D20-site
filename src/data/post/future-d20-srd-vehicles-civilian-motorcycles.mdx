## Civilian Motorcycles


Mounting a motorcycle is a free action, and the motorcycle provides no cover to its occupantsexcept as noted below. The operative skill for motorcycles is Drive.

### Harris-Musselman Dirt Bike (PL 6)


Known as the Muscleman, the H-M is a popular recreational motorcycle that also happens to enjoy wide use by military recon units. It is 1 square wide and 2 squares long.


### Stradtler Valkyrie (PL 7)


Stradtler's version of the street bike upholds the Norwegian motor company's reputation for high performance and luxury. Constructed on the chopper frame, the Valkyrie has a triple-wide rear tire and a center of gravity set slightly further back than normal street cycles, enabling it to get up on the rear wheel for impressive displays of motorcycle riding. It is 1 square wide and 2 squares long.
