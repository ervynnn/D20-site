## Combat


Combat is played out in rounds, and in each round everybody acts in turn in a regular cycle. Combat usually runs in the following way.


1. Each combatant starts the battle flat-footed. Once a combatant acts, he or she is no longer flat-footed.


2. The GM determines which characters are aware of their opponents at the start of the battle. If some but not all of the combatants are aware of their opponents, a [surprise
  round](modern-d20-srd-combat-surprise) happens before regular rounds begin. The combatants who are aware of their opponents can act in the [surprise
  round](modern-d20-srd-combat-surprise), so they roll for [initiative](modern-d20-srd-combat-initiative). In [initiative](modern-d20-srd-combat-initiative) order (highest to lowest), combatants who started the battle aware of their opponents each take one [move](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions) or [attack
  action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions). Combatants who were unaware dont get to act in the surprise round. If no one or everyone starts the battle aware, there is no surprise round.


3. Combatants who have not yet rolled [initiative](modern-d20-srd-combat-initiative) do so. All combatants are now ready to begin their first regular round.


4. Combatants act in [initiative](modern-d20-srd-combat-initiative) order.	


5. When everyone has had a turn, the combatant with the highest [initiative](modern-d20-srd-combat-initiative) acts again, and steps 4 and 5 repeat until combat ends.
