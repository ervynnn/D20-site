## Attack Options

Firing a [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)’s
[weapon](modern-d20-srd-equipment-military-vehicles) requires an [attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) and uses the driver’s or
gunner’s [ranged attack modifier](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-bonus). A
driver with 5 or more ranks in the [Drive](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive) skill
gains a +2 synergy bonus when firing [vehicle-mounted weapons](modern-d20-srd-equipment-military-vehicles) while driving.

Some [military vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-military-vehicles) are
equipped with fire-control computers. These systems grant equipment
[bonuses](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-bonus) on [attack rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) with the [vehicle-mounted weapons](modern-d20-srd-equipment-military-vehicles) to which they apply.

Driving Defensively: Just as in [melee combat](modern-d20-srd-combat-index),
one can fight defensively while driving a [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles), which grants a +2 [dodge bonus](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) to the vehicle’s [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) and applies
a –4 penalty on [attack rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) made by
occupants of the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-military-vehicles). Total
Defense: A driver can choose the total defense action which grants a +4 [dodge bonus](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) to [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) but does not allow the driver to attack (gunners or passengers take a
–8 penalty on [attack rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll)). These
modifiers last until the driver’s next round of actions.

Full Attack Action: A driver cannot normally make a [full attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions), since controlling the
[vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-military-vehicles) requires a [move action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions).

Gunners or passengers, however, can take [full attack actions](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions), since they don’t have to use a [move action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions) (except, perhaps, to change
positions in the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)). In
general, taking a [full attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions) is useful only if a character has a base [attack bonus](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-bonus) high enough to get multiple
attacks. A passenger can make [multiple attacks](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions) with his or her own [weapon](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-weapons). A gunner can make [multiple attacks](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions) with one or more [weapons](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-weapons) controlled from his or her position.
