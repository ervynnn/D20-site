##  Seed: Afflict

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Fear, Mind-Affecting]

Knowledge (arcane lore) DC: 30; Range: Close; Target: One living creature;
Duration: Minutes; Saving Throw: Will negates; Spell Resistance: Yes You
afflict the target with a –2 morale penalty on attack rolls, checks, and
saving throws. For each additional –1 penalty assessed on either the target’s
attack rolls, checks, or saving throws, increase the Knowledge (arcane lore)
check DC by +2.

You may also develop an incantation with this seed that afflicts the target
with a –1 penalty on caster level checks, a –1 penalty to an ability score, a
–1 penalty to spell resistance, or a –1 penalty to some other aspect of the
target. For each additional –1 penalty assessed in one of the above
categories, increase the Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by +4.

You can afflict a character’s ability scores to the point where they reach 0,
save for Constitution where 1 is the minimum. If you’re applying ability
penalties, you can’t lengthen the duration. Instead, you can increase the
Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by +2 to turn the penalties into temporary
ability damage, or increase the Knowledge (arcane lore) DC by +10 to turn the
penalties into permanent ability drain. If you increase the Knowledge (arcane
lore) check DC by +2, you can afflict whichever one of the target’s senses you
select: sight, touch, hearing, taste, touch, or a special sense the target
possesses. If the target fails its saving throw, the sense you select doesn’t
function for the spell’s duration, with all attendant penalties that apply for
losing the specified sense.

Options: Useful options for incantations with the afflict seed include having
a hair, fingernail, or other part of the target (+2 bonus); having the target
present and helpless during the incantation (+6 bonus); or building an
elaborate model or doll of the target (+4 bonus).
