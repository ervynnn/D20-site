### Class Features


The following class features pertain to the Explorer advanced class.


Explorer Lore
An Explorer picks up stray and obscure facts during her adventures. She may make a special Explorer lore check with a bonus equal to her Explorer class level + her Intelligence modifier to see whether or not she knows some relevant knowledge about notable people, legendary items, or noteworthy places. If the Explorer has 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (history), she gains a +2 bonus on this check. She may take 10 but cannot take 20 on this check.


An Explorer lore check does not reveal the powers of a magic or psionic item but may give some hint as to its general function; an Explorer may not take 10 or take 20 on this check.


| Table: Explorer Lore |  |  |
| :---------------------- | :--: | --: |
|  |  |  |
| 10 | Common, known by at least a substantial minority of the local population. | A local official's hobbies and interests; common legends or rumors about a powerful place of mystery. |
| 20 | Uncommon but available, known by only a few people in the area. | The coordinates of an known but uncharted world; legends or rumors about a powerful psionic artifact. |
| 25 | Obscure, known by few, hard to come by. | The customs of a documented alien species; the true homeworld of an ancient royal dynasty. |
| 30 | Extremely obscure, known by very few, possibly forgotten by most who once knew it, possibly known only by those who don't understand the knowledge's significance. | The most likely location of a long-lost pharaoh's tomb; the history of a powerful artifact and its creator; the likely coordinates of a fabled but as-yet-undiscovered planet. |



Survivalist
At 1st level, the Explorer gains the bonus feats Guide and Track.


Resolve
Beginning at 2nd level, an Explorer gains a morale bonus equal to one-half her Explorer class level (rounded down) on saving throws to resist fear effects and Intimidate checks.


Skilled Searcher
When actively searching for secret doors or traps, an Explorer of 2nd level or higher gains a bonus on her Search checks equal to one-half her Explorer class level (rounded down).


Bonus Feats
At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Explorer gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Explorer must meet all the prerequisites of the feat to select it.


Action Boost, Advanced Two-Weapon Fighting, Aircraft Operation (spacecraft), Archaic Weapons Proficiency, Attentive, Brawl, Dodge, Educated, Endurance, Exotic Firearms Proficiency, Exotic Melee Weapon Proficiency, Heroic Surge, Improved Feint, Improved Knockout Punch, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Jack of All Trades, Knockout Punch, Mobility, Nimble, Renown, Spacer, Streetfighting, Studious, Track, Two-Weapon Fighting, Vehicle Expert.


Trap Sense
At 4th level, an Explorer gains an intuitive sense that alerts her to danger from traps, giving her a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to Defense against attacks made by traps.


These bonuses rise to +2 at 7th level and +3 at 10th level.


Extra Step
An Explorer of 5th level or higher can spend an action point to take an extra 5-foot step during her turn, as a free action. This extra 5-foot step does not provoke attacks of opportunity.


At 10th level, the Explorer can take the extra 5-foot step without spending an action point.


Explorer's Evasion
If an Explorer of 8th level or higher is exposed to any effect that normally allows a character to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage, the Explorer suffers no damage if she makes a successful saving throw. If the Explorer already has evasion, she gains improved evasion instead. Improved evasion works similar to evasion, except the Explorer suffers only half damage on a failed saving throw.
