## Creature Types

A creatures type determines many of its characteristics and abilities: physical ability scores, Hit Die type, base attack bonus, [saving throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) bonuses, skill points, feats, and special qualities. Mental [ability scores](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) ([Intelligence](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores), [Wisdom](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores), and [Charisma](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)) can vary widely among creatures of a type; unless a type description specifies a particular score for one of these abilities, the GM will assign values as he or she deems appropriate.

A creature belongs to one of the fifteen types described below. A single creature cannot have more than one type.

Table: Creature Saves and Base Attack Bonuses provides the modifiers to a creatures saving throws and attack rolls based on its type and Hit Dice.
