## Use

      Feat

     ,

      Skill

     , or Talent




     Certain
     [feats](modern-d20-srd-feats-index)
     , let a character take special actions in combat. Other feats are not actions in themselves, but they give a character a bonus when attempting something he or she can already do. Some feats aren’t meant to be used within the framework of combat. The individual feat descriptions tell a character what he or she needs to know about them.




     Most uses of skills or talents in a combat situation are attack actions, but some might be
     [move  actions](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions)
or
[full-round actions](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions)
. When appropriate, the description of a talent or a skill provides the time required to use it.
