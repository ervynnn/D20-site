## Vehicles


### New Vehicles


As oil prices rise and consumers insist on more safety measures in vehicles, engineers push the technology envelope. The major motor companies create personal hovermobiles that handle like cars, build cars that drive themselves, and unveil vehicles that can travel over water, underwater, and, in some cases, underground.


### Vehicles And Progress Levels


Although each of the vehicles listed below has a Progress Level associated with it, specifics of the vehicle can be modified to fit into an earlier or later Progress Level. Modify the top speed, initiative, and maneuver scores of vehicleslower numbers for lower PLs, higher numbers for higher PLsand adjust the purchase DC accordingly.
