##  Minor Globe of Invulnerability

Abjuration

[ Level ](modern-d20-srd-fx-level) : [ Mage ](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-mage) 4; [ Components ](modern-d20-srd-fx-components) : V, S, M; [ Casting Time ](modern-d20-srd-fx-casting-time) ; [ Attack action ](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) [ Range ](modern-d20-srd-fx-range) : 10 ft.; [ Area](modern-d20-srd-fx-area) : 10-ft.-radius spherical emanation, centered on
you; [ Duration ](modern-d20-srd-fx-duration) : 1 round/level; [ Saving Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) : None; [ Spell Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance) : No

An immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere surrounds the caster and
excludes all spell effects of 3rd level and lower. The area or effect of any
such spells does not include the area of the minor globe of invulnerability.
Such spells fail to affect any target located within the globe. This includes
spell-like abilities and spells or spell-like effects from objects. However,
any type of spell can be cast through or out of the magical globe. Spells of
4th level and higher are not affected by the globe. The globe can be brought
down by a targeted [ dispel magic ](modern-d20-srd-fx-dispel-magic) spell, but
not by an area [ dispel magic ](modern-d20-srd-fx-dispel-magic) . The caster
can leave and return to the globe without penalty.

Note that spell effects are not disrupted unless their effects enter the
globe, and even then they are merely suppressed, not dispelled.

If a given spell has more than one level depending on which character class is
casting it, use the level appropriate to the caster to determine whether minor
globe of invulnerability stops it.
