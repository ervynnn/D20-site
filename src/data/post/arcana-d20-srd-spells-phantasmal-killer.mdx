## Phantasmal Killer

Illusion [Fear, Mind-Affecting]

Level: Arcane 4; Components: V, S; Casting Time: Attack action; Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level); Target: One living creature; Duration: Instantaneous; Saving Throw: Will disbelief (if interacted with), then Fortitude partial; Spell Resistance: Yes

You create the phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the subject simply by forming the fears of the subjects subconscious mind into something that its conscious mind can visualize: this most horrible beast. Only the spells subject can perceive the phantasmal killer. You see only a shadowy shape. The subject first gets a Will save to recognize the image as unreal. If the subject fails the Will save, the phantasm touches him, and he must succeed at a Fortitude save or die from fear. Even if the Fortitude save is successful, the subject takes 3d6 points of damage.
