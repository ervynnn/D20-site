## Cloudkill


Conjuration (Creation)


[Level](modern-d20-srd-fx-level): [Mage](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-mage) 5; [Components](modern-d20-srd-fx-components): V, S; [Casting Time](modern-d20-srd-fx-casting-time): [Attack
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions); [Range](modern-d20-srd-fx-range): Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level); Effect: Cloud spreads 30 ft. wide and 20 ft. high; [Duration](modern-d20-srd-fx-duration):  1 minute/level; [Saving
Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): See text; [Spell
Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance): Yes



A bank of yellowish green [poisonous](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-poison) fog billows out from the point the character designates. The fog obscures all sight, including [darkvision](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-darkvision), beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has one-half [concealment](modern-d20-srd-combat-concealment) (attacks suffer a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total [concealment](modern-d20-srd-combat-concealment) (50% miss chance, and the attacker cant use sight to locate the target). The fogs vapors kill any living creature with 3 or fewer HD (no save) and cause creatures with 4 to 6 HD to make [Fortitude
saving throws](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) or die. Living creatures above 6 HD, and creatures of 4 to 6 HD who make their saving throws, take 1d10 points of [poison](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-poison) [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) each round while in the cloud. Holding ones breath doesnt help.



The cloudkill moves away from the character at 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground. (Figure out the clouds new spread each round based on its new point of origin, 10 feet farther away from the point of origin where the character cast the spell.) Because the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings. It cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast underwater.


A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.
