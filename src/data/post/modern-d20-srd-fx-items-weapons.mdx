## Weapons

As with [armor](modern-d20-srd-fx-items-armor), magic and psionic weapons have enhancement bonuses. The enhancement bonus applies both to [attack rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) and [damage rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) when the weapon is used in combat. All magic weapons and psionic weapons are considered [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) items, but a weapon’s [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) bonus does not stack with its enhancement bonus.

In addition to an enhancement bonus, weapons may have special qualities. A weapon with a special quality must have a +1 or better enhancement bonus.

Fully 30% of magic or psionic weapons shed light in a 20-foot radius. These glowing weapons cannot be [concealed](modern-d20-srd-equipment-concealed-weapons-objects) when drawn, nor can their light be shut off.

If a weapon has a special quality that the user needs to activate, then the user must speak a command word (an [attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions)).

Purchase DC: To calculate the purchase DC for a weapon with an enchantment bonus but no special qualities, use the following table.

| Enhancement Bonus | Purchase DC Modifier |
| :---------------- | -------------------: |
| +1                |                  +10 |
| +2                |                  +15 |
| +3                |                  +20 |

Weapons with special qualities have an additional purchase DC modifier, as noted under each item entry.
