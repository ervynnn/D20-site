## APE Police Robot (PL 6)


The Armed Police Escort (APE) robot is designed to help police deal with civil disobedience and unrest in the urban jungle. This robot resembles a hulking, apelike man with thick arms and legs, clad headto- toe in interlocking duralloy plates. The robot's hands can be used for grappling or carrying items. It usually carries an OICW assault rifle. In addition, it has a mini-grenade launcher (with a compartment for concussion grenades) mounted in its left forearm and a laser pistol mounted in its right forearm. The APE robot cannot use its mounted weapons if it is grappling.
