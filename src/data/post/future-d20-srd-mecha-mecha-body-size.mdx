### Large Mecha


Essentially big suits of armor, Large mecha excel in urban battlefields and starship boarding actions, where they move through buildings and corridors to find the enemy. Large mecha are the easiest to operate. However, they can't carry the intense array of weapons that bigger mecha can, nor are they as strong or durable.

### Huge Mecha


Common weapons on the futuristic battlefield, Huge mecha offer a solid balance between cost, agility, and sheer bulk. They perform well in any combat
environment, but they favor locations with some variation in terrain. In the wide-open desert or depths of outer space, they can fall prey larger mecha.

### Gargantuan Mecha


Gargantuan mecha are highly experimental in PL 6 societies, but quite common at PL 7. Units of this size are titans of the battlefield, able to destroy almost anything they can hit. Gargantuan mecha are common in outer space environments but are often too expensive and unwieldy for planet-based missions.

### Colossal Mecha


Colossal mecha do not exist in PL 6 societies and are rare sights even at PL 7. Only at PL 8 do they leave the experimental stage and enter the battlefield in respectable numbers. Massive juggernauts, Colossal mecha represent the epitome of futuristic warfare, with firepower sufficient to destroy starships or level entire city blocks. They typically serve as mobile artillery and walking weapon platforms.
