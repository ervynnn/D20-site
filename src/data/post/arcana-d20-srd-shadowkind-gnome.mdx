     Gnome




     Size: Small. Gnomes gain a +1 size bonus to Defense, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on Hide checks. They suffer a 4 size penalty on grapple checks. Gnomes must use smaller weapons than humans use, and their lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of a Medium character.




     Ability Modifiers: 2 Strength, +2 Constitution.




     Base Speed: 20 feet.




     Special Combat Bonuses: Gnomes gain a +1 species bonus on attack rolls against bugbears, goblins (and other goblinoids), and kobolds. Gnomes also gain a +4 dodge bonus to their Defense against giant creatures (such as ogres and trolls); this bonus represents special training that gnomes undergo, during which they learn tricks that previous generations developed in their battles with giants. Note that any time a gnome loses his positive Dexterity bonus to Defense, such as when hes caught flat-footed, he loses this dodge bonus, too.




     Illusion Mastery: Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against Illusion spells cast by gnomes.




     Speak with Animals: Once per day, a gnome can use speak with animals to speak with a burrowing mammal (a mole, gopher, ground hog, and so forth). It has a duration of 1 minute, and the gnome is considered a 1st-level caster when he uses this spell-like ability, regardless of his actual level.




     Low-Light Vision: Gnomes can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.




     Saving Throw Bonus: Gnomes gain a +2 species bonus on saving throws against illusions.




     Skill Bonuses: Gnomes gain a +2 species bonus on Listen checks. Gnomes who have one or more ranks in the Craft (pharmaceutical) skill also gain a +2 species bonus on Craft (pharmaceutical) checks.




     Bonus Feats: Gnomes gain the bonus feat Archaic Weapons Proficiency. They may treat gnome hooked hammers (see Chapter Two: Equipment) as archaic weapons instead of exotic weapons.




     Gnomes with Charisma scores of 10 or higher gain the bonus feat Magical Heritage.




     Free Language Skills: Read/Write Common (or local language), Read/Write Gnome, Speak Common (or local language), Speak Gnome.




     Other Languages: Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Goblin, Orc.
