## 
     Environment Seal
    



     Since many armors are designed with a particular environment in mind, this gadget provides the wearer protection from harsh conditions.
    



     The environment seal gadget transforms any armor into a stable and insulated artificial environment. This provides the wearer with the right amount of breathable air and external pressure to assure comfort and survival for up to eight hours, ensuring that the armor can function in the extremes of the deep sea or deep space,along with any environment in between. Only certain types of armor can handle this modification and those that do usually integrate a sealed helmet, body glove, and emergency air tanks to generate internal atmosphere.
