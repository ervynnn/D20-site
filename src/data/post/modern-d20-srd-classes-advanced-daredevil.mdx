### Action Boost

A Daredevil can spend 1 [action point](modern-d20-srd-basics-action-points), see the result of the roll, and then decide to spend a second point, as long as he or she does so before the Gamemaster reveals the result of the action.

### Adrenaline Rush

At 5th level, a Daredevil can temporarily increase one of his or her physical ability scores ([Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores), [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores), or [Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)). The Daredevil spends 1 [action point](modern-d20-srd-basics-action-points) and gets to increase the selected ability score by 1d4+1 points.
