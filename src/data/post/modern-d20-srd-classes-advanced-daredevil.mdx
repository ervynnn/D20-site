### Fearless

A Daredevil gains a +4 morale bonus on [Will saves](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) to resist fear effects and on level checks to oppose
[Intimidate](modern-d20-srd-skills-intimidate) checks.

must be selected from the following list, and the Daredevil must meet all the
prerequisites of the feat to select it.

[Acrobatic](modern-d20-srd-feats-acrobatic), [Armor Proficiency (light)](modern-d20-srd-feats-armor-proficiency-light), [Armor Proficiency (medium)](modern-d20-srd-feats-armor-proficiency-medium),

### Action Boost

This ability, gained at 4th level, allows a Daredevil to spend 2 [action points](modern-d20-srd-basics-action-points) on a single action in a round. A
Daredevil can spend 1 [action point](modern-d20-srd-basics-action-points), see
the result of the roll, and then decide to spend a second point, as long as he
or she does so before the Gamemaster reveals the result of the action.

At 5th level, a Daredevil can temporarily increase one of his or her physical
ability scores ([Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores),
[Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores), or
[Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)). The Daredevil spends 1
[action point](modern-d20-srd-basics-action-points) and gets to increase the
selected ability score by 1d4+1 points. The increase lasts for a number of
rounds equal to his or her class level. At the end of the duration, the
Daredevil is fatigued for 1d4+1 rounds.

At 8th level, a Daredevil can temporarily increase two physical [ability scores](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores). At the end of the duration, the
Daredevil is fatigued for 1d6+2 rounds.

### Delay Damage

level.

increase stacks with the increase provided by the [Improved Damage Threshold](modern-d20-srd-combat-death-dying-healing) feat.
