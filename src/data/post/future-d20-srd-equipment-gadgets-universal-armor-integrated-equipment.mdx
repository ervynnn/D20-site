## 
     Integrated Equipment
    



     A particular piece of nonweapon equipment has been integrated into the armor and can be used by the armor's wearer at any time. This gadget is often used to add features such as glow-lamps or duracable to armor, though it is not limited to those applications. Indeed, some armors are intended to make their wearers into independent one-person armies, and sport a dozen or more such equipment integrations.
    



     When selecting the integrated equipment gadget, choose a piece of equipment. That equipment is integrated into the base armor and can be used at any time. Additionally, you must choose whether or not the equipment may be physically separated from the base armor or not at the time of purchase. This gadget may be selected multiple times, each time adding a single additional piece of equipment to the base model.
    




      Restrictions
     
     : The character must also purchase the piece of equipment to be integrated separately from the armor, before the
gadget modification is made.
