## Heavy Starship Subtypes


Heavy starships are the workhorses of space travel: battle cruisers, battleships, fleet carriers, tankers, liners, and heavy transports. They move relatively quicklythanks to massive enginesbut maneuver very slowly. Their real strength lies in their armor and armaments; even civilian heavy starships are built to take a pounding.


A heavy starship measures 1,001-1,500 feet long. It has a 1,500- foot-by-1,500-foot fighting space (9 500-foot squares).


In addition, all heavy starships share the following design specs.


Engines: All heavy starships have thrusters plus one other type of engine (see Starship Engines).


Armor: A heavy starship has one type of armor (see Starship Armor).


Defensive Systems: A heavy starship has a maximum of one defensive system per 50 Hit Dice (see Starship Defense Systems).


Sensors: A heavy starship has a maximum of three sensor systems (see Starship Sensors).


Communications: A heavy starship has two external communication systems (see Starship Comm Systems).


Weapons: A heavy starship has one beam, projectile, or missile weapon per 50 Hit Dice (see Starship Weapons). These weapons are often arrayed in batteries. A minelayer is considered a single weapon. Although it weighs no more than a few thousand pounds, each mine consumes 100 tons of a ship's cargo capacity (most of it taken up by the launch system and radiation shielding).


Grappling Systems: A heavy starship may have up to two grappling systems (see Grappling Systems). Each grappling system takes away one of the ship's weapon
slots (see above).
