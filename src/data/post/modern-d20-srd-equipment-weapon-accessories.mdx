As if modern weapons weren’t dangerous enough, a number of accessories can
increase their utility or efficiency.

### Box Magazine

For weapons that use box magazines, a character can purchase extras. Loading
these extra magazines ahead of time and keeping them in a handy place makes it
easy to reload a weapon in combat.

### Detonator

A detonator activates an explosive, causing it to explode. The device consists
of an electrically activated blasting cap and some sort of device that
delivers the electrical charge to set off the blasting cap. Connecting a
detonator to an explosive requires a [Demolitions](modern-d20-srd-skills-demolitions) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index)
(DC 15). Failure means that the explosive fails to go off as planned. Failure
by 10 or more means the explosive goes off as the detonator is being
installed.

Blasting Cap: This is a detonator without a built-in controller. It can be
wired into any electrical device, such as a light switch or a car’s ignition
switch, with a [Demolitions](modern-d20-srd-skills-demolitions)
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 10).
When the electrical device is activated, the detonator goes off.

Radio Control: This device consists of two parts: the detonator itself and the
activation device. The activation device is an electronic item about the size
of a deck of cards, with an antenna, a safety, and an activation switch. When
the switch is toggled, the activation device sends a signal to the detonator
by radio, setting it off. It has a range of 500 feet.

Timed: This is an electronic timer connected to the detonator. Like an alarm
clock, it can be set to go off at a particular time.

Wired: This is the simplest form of detonator. The blasting cap connects by a
wire to an activation device, usually a small pistol-grip device that the user
squeezes. The detonator comes with 100 feet of wire, but longer lengths can be
spliced in with a [Demolitions](modern-d20-srd-skills-demolitions)
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 10).

### Holster

Holsters are generally available for all Medium-size or smaller firearms.

Hip: This holster holds the weapon in an easily accessed—and easily
seen—location.

Concealed Carry: A concealed carry holster is designed to help keep a weapon
out of sight (see [Concealed Weapons and Objects](modern-d20-srd-equipment-concealed-weapons-objects)). In most cases, this is a shoulder holster (the
weapon fits under the wearer’s armpit, presumably beneath a jacket). Small or
Tiny weapons can be carried in waistband holsters (often placed inside the
wearer’s waistband against his or her back). Tiny weapons can also be carried
in ankle or boot holsters.

### Illuminator

An illuminator is a small flashlight that mounts to a firearm, freeing up one
of the user’s hands. It functions as a standard flashlight.

### Laser Sight

This small laser mounts on a firearm, and projects a tiny red dot on the
weapon’s target. A laser sight grants a +1 equipment bonus on all [attack rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) made against targets no farther than
30 feet away. However, a laser sight can’t be used outdoors during the
daytime.

### Scope

A scope is a sighting device that makes it easier to hit targets at long
range. However, although a scope magnifies the image of the target, it has a
very limited field of view, making it difficult to use.

Standard: A standard scope increases the range increment for a ranged weapon
by one-half (multiply by 1.5). However, to use a scope a character must spend
an [attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) acquiring his or her
target. If the character changes targets or otherwise lose sight of the
target, he or she must reacquire the target to gain the benefit of the scope.

Electro-Optical: An electro-optical scope functions the same as a standard
scope in normal light. In darkness, however, the user sees through it as if he
or she had the darkvision ability granted by night vision goggles.

### Speed Loader

A speed loader holds a number of bullets in a ring, in a position that mirrors
the chambers in a revolver cylinder. Using a speed loader saves time in
reloading a revolver, since a character can insert all the bullets at once.

### Suppressor

A suppressor fits on the end of a firearm, capturing the gases traveling at
supersonic speed that propel a bullet as it is fired. This eliminates the
noise from the bullet’s firing, dramatically reducing the sound the weapon
makes when it is used. For handguns, the only sound is the mechanical action
of the weapon ([Listen](modern-d20-srd-skills-listen) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), DC 15, to notice). For
[longarms](modern-d20-srd-equipment-weapons-longarms), the supersonic speed of
the bullet itself still makes noise. However, it’s difficult to tell where the
sound is coming from, requiring a [Listen](modern-d20-srd-skills-listen)
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 15) to
locate the source of the gunfire.

Modifying a weapon to accept a suppressor requires a [Repair](modern-d20-srd-skills-repair) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 15). Once a weapon has been modified in this manner, a suppressor
can be attached or removed as a [move action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions).

Suppressors cannot be used on revolvers or shotguns. A suppressor purchased
for one weapon can be used for any other weapon that fires the same caliber of
ammunition.
