## Fusion Age Weapon Gadgets


The following gadgets are found in the Fusion Age and can apply to weapons of that era or later, provided all gadget-specific restrictions are observed.


### Scope, Video


The video scope is a special modification to ranged weapons that provides an easier way to survey remote portions of the battlefield from the comfort of a safe haven. The video scope is a three-inch- by-three-inch viewscreen attached to the rear of a standard scope. It allows the weapon's user to sit back and examine the details in the image rather than having to press his eye against the scope. Additionally, the viewscreen can be used to freeze-frame and take still images and boasts zoom and image enhancement software, allowing on-the-fly computer analysis and dissection of battlefield images. Some video scopes are capable of receiving broadcast images from remote locations, allowing the screen to be used for video communication (by jacking in an optional earpiece and microphone) or to transmit maps and movement orders with visual aides.


Restrictions: Ranged weapons only.
Purchase DC Modifier: +3.
