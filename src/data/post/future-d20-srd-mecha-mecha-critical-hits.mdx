## Mecha Critical Hits


Whenever you confirm a critical hit against a mecha, you may choose to roll percentile dice and consult Table: Mecha Critical Hits instead of dealing the normal critical hit damage for the attack. However, you must accept the results of the roll, even if those results are less than desirable.


| Table: Mecha Critical Hits |  |
| :---------------------------- | --: |
|  |  |
| 01'15 | Normal damage, crew dazed |
| 16'35 | Normal critical hit, crew dazed |
| 36'45 | Normal critical hit, mecha knocked prone |
| 46'50 | Severe critical hit, crew dazed, mecha stunned |
| 51'55 | Severe critical hit, mecha knocked prone |
| 56'60 | Crew hit (normal damage) |
| 61'70 | Normal damage, equipment damaged |
| 71'80 | Normal damage, equipment destroyed |
| 81'90 | Normal critical hit, slot damaged |
| 91'100 | Normal critical hit, slot destroyed |



Normal Damage: The attack deals normal damage (do not apply critical hit multipliers).


Crew Dazed: Each crewmember aboard the mecha, including its operator, must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 15) or be dazed for 1 round. Unable to act, a dazed character can take no actions, but still retains his or her full Defense.


Normal Critical Hit: Roll critical hit damage normally.


Mecha Knocked Prone: The force of the attack knocks the mecha prone. All crewmembers and passengers aboard take 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage as they are knocked about their cockpits. A prone mecha takes a '4 penalty on melee attack rolls and can't use thrown ranged weapons. The mecha gains a +4 bonus to Defense against ranged attacks, but takes a '4 penalty to Defense against melee attacks.


Standing up from prone is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity.


Mecha Stunned: The mecha automatically drops what it is holding and can take no attack or move actions for 1 round. While the mecha is stunned, apply a '2 penalty to the mecha operator's Defense (even though the operator is not stunned).


Severe Critical Hit: Roll critical hit damage using a x5 multiplier instead of the weapon's normal multiplier.


Crew Hit: The attack bypasses the mecha's armor and superstructure. Apply normal damage to one crewmember or passenger (determined randomly), ignoring the mecha's bonus hit points.


Equipment Destroyed: One piece of equipment (attacker's choice) is damaged and ceases to function until repaired. It can be a flight system, sensor system, defense system, weapon (handheld or integrated), or miscellaneous system. Repairing a damaged system requires 1 hour of work and a successful Repair check (DC 20).


Equipment Destroyed: One piece of equipment (attacker's choice) is destroyed and ceases to function. It can be a flight system, sensor system, defense system, weapon (handheld or integrated), or miscellaneous system. A destroyed system cannot be repaired, only replaced.


Slot Damaged: One of the mecha's equipment slots (attacker's choice) is damaged. Any piece of equipment wholly or partially installed in that slot will not function until the slot is repaired. Repairing a damaged equipment slot requires 1 hour of work and a successful Repair check (DC 25).


Slot Destroyed: One of the mecha's equipment slots (attacker's choice) is destroyed, along with any piece of equipment wholly or partially installed in it. Rebuilding a destroyed equipment slot requires 12 hours of work and a successful Craft (mechanical) check (DC 30).
