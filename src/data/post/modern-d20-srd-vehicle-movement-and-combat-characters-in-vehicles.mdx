    Characters in Vehicles




    A character in a
    [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
    fills one of several possible roles, which determines what the character can do.




    Driver: The driver of the
    [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
    controls its
    [movement](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-moving)
    . Most
    [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
    have only one position from where the
    [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
    can be driven, so the person seated there is the driver. Driving a
    [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
    is, at a minimum, a
    [move  action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions)
, which means that the driver may be able to do something else with his or her
[attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions)
. There can be only one driver in a
[vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
at one time.

    Copilot: A copilot can help the driver by taking an
    [aid  another](modern-d20-srd-combat-aid-another)
action. The copilot must be seated in a location where he or she can see the road and advise the driver (in a car, this generally means the front passenger seat). Aiding the driver is a
[move action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions)
, leaving the copilot with an
[attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions)
each round to do something else. A
[vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
can have only one copilot at a time. A copilot can also drive the
[vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
if the driver cannot or chooses not to, provided there is a second set of controls at the copilots seat (usually true in
[aircraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-civilian-aircraft)
, but not
[ground vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
).

    Gunner: Some
    [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
    have
    [built-in  weapons](modern-d20-srd-equipment-military-vehicles)
. If such a
[weapon](modern-d20-srd-equipment-military-vehicles)
is controlled from a location other than the drivers position, a character can man that position and become the gunner. A
[vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
can have as many gunners as it has gunner positions.

    Passenger: All other personnel aboard the
    [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
    are considered passengers. Passengers have no specific role in the
    [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
    operation, but may be able to fire
    [weapons](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-weapons)
    from the
    [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
    or take other actions.
