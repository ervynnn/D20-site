     Enlarge Power [Metapsionic]




     You can manifest powers farther than normal.





      Benefit:

     An enlarged power has its range doubled. Powers whose ranges are not defined by distance do not have their ranges increased. Determine an enlarged powers area or effect as if you were two manifester levels higher than you actually are. An enlarged power costs a number of power points equal to its standard cost +2.
