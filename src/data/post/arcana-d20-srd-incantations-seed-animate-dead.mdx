##  Seed: Animate Dead

Necromancy

Knowledge (arcane lore) DC: 34; Range: Touch; Targets: One or more corpses
touched; Duration: Instantaneous; Saving Throw: None; Spell Resistance: No

You can turn the bones or bodies of dead creatures into undead that follow
your spoken commands. The undead can follow you, or they can remain in an area
and attack any creature (or a specific type of creature) entering the place.
The undead remain animated until they are destroyed. (A destroyed undead can’t
be animated again.) Intelligent undead can follow more sophisticated commands.

The animate dead seed (which is more potent than the animate dead spell)
allows you create 20 HD of undead. For each additional 1 HD of undead created,
increase the Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by +1. The undead you create
remain under your control indefinitely.

You can naturally control 20 HD of undead creatures you’ve personally created,
regardless of the method you used. If you exceed this number, newly created
creatures fall under your control, and excess undead from previous castings
become uncontrolled (you choose which creatures are released). Any undead you
command through a class-based ability to command or rebuke undead do not count
toward the limit.

For each additional 2 HD of undead to be controlled, increase the Knowledge
(arcane lore) check DC by +1. Only undead in excess of 20 HD created with this
seed can be controlled using this DC adjustment. If you want to both create
and control more than 20 HD of undead, increase the Knowledge (arcane lore) DC
by +3 per additional 2 HD of undead.

Type of Undead: All types of undead can be created with the animate dead seed,
although creating more powerful undead increases the Knowledge (arcane lore)
check DC, according to the chart below. The GM must set the Knowledge (arcane
lore) check DC for undead not included on the chart, using similar undead as a
basis for comparison.
