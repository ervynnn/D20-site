## Equipment (Vehicles)

Vehicles are described by a number of statistics.

Crew: The standard number of crew. In most cases, only one person is needed to drive the vehicle; other crew members serve as gunners or copilots.

Passengers: The number of passengers (in addition to the crew) the vehicle is designed to carry. Vehicles that carry passengers can use that space to carry additional cargo when passengers arent present. Each unused passenger slot allows the vehicle to carry an additional 100 pounds of cargo.

Cargo Capacity: The amount of cargo the vehicle is designed to carry. Many vehicles can carry extra passengers instead of cargo, but doing so is usually a cramped, uncomfortable, and often unsafe experience for those passengers. As a rule of thumb, one additional passenger can be carried for each 250 pounds of unused cargo capacity.

Initiative: The modifier added to the drivers or pilots [initiative](modern-d20-srd-combat-initiative) check when operating the vehicle.

Maneuver: The modifier added to any [Drive](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive) or [Pilot](modern-d20-srd-skills-pilot) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) attempted with the vehicle.

Top Speed: The maximum number of squares the vehicle can cover in 1 round at character scale (with the number of squares at chase scale in parentheses). This is the fastest the vehicle can move.

Defense: The vehicles [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense).

Hardness: The vehicles hardness. Subtract this number from any [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) dealt to the vehicle.

Hit Points: The vehicles full normal [hit points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points).

Size: Vehicle size categories are defined differently from the size categories for weapons and other objects.

Purchase DC: This is the purchase DC for a [Wealth check](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check) to acquire the vehicle. This number reflects the base price and doesnt include any modifier for purchasing the vehicle on the black market.

Restriction: The restriction rating for the vehicle, if any, and the appropriate black market purchase DC modifier. Remember to apply this modifier to the purchase DC when making a Wealth check to acquire the vehicle on the black market.
