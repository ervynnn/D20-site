     Tool Mount (PL 5)




     Any robot with an armature, biomorph, biodroid, or bioreplica frame can be equipped with a tool mount. Liquid-state robots, due to their amorphous nature, cannot have tool mounts.




     This mount is usually attached to the end of a robotic appendage and sports a single tool. A tool mount easily adjusts to house different kinds of tools, but it can hold only one tool at any given time.




     The robots internal power source powers the tool, if necessary.




     The tool can be up to one size category larger than the robots size category; for example, a Medium-size robots tool mount can bear a Large or smaller tool. The tool can be any general item.




     Purchase DC: 1 + the purchase DC of the tool.




     Restriction: None.
