## Mecha Weapon Boost


By disabling safeguards and shunting auxiliary power into your weapons, you can attain greater destructive power at the cost of weapon accuracy.


Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +8, Repair 6 ranks.


Benefit: You can take a penalty of up to '5 on your attack roll. If you do, the mecha weapon of your choice deals +1d6 points of damage for each '1 penalty you took. The attack penalty persists until the beginning of your next turn, but the additional damage applies only to the next single attack you make.
