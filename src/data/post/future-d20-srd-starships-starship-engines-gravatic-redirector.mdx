## 
    Gravitic Redirector (PL 8)
   



    A refinement of the induction engine, the gravitic redirector creates a gravitic singularityessentially, a sub-microscopic black holein the vicinity of the ship, producing a constant pull on the ship. By changing the location of the singularity relative to the ship, the pilot can change the direction of the ships travel. The gravitic redirector is more powerful and more efficient than the induction engine, and at the height of the technologys heyday, virtually foolproof. A gravitic redirector does not operate within a planetary atmosphere, and most ships fitted with this kind of engine also have secondary thrusters or rely on shuttlecraft.
   



    Minimum Ship Size: Colossal.
   



    Tactical Speed Bonus: +1,500 feet (+3 squares).
   



    Purchase DC: 10 + one-half the base purchase DC of the starship.
