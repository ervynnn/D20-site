##  Electricity

Electrical hazards come in many forms, including stun guns, downed power
lines, and electric security fences. Table: Electricity Damage gives [ damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) values for various electrical hazards based on
relative voltage. A character can make a Fortitude [ saving throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) to reduce the damage by half. If that
character is not grounded or is otherwise insulated from the current, a
successful [ save ](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) indicates that no
damage is suffered.
