## Starship Mobility


You are adept at dodging attacks while piloting starships.


Prerequisite: Dexterity 13, Starship Dodge.


Benefit: When piloting a starship of a type with which you are proficient (see the Starship Operation feat), you apply a +4 dodge bonus to your ship’s Defense against attacks of opportunity caused when you move out of or within a starship’s threatened area. Any condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Defense also makes you lose your dodge bonuses. Dodge bonuses (such as this one and the dodge bonus granted by the Starship Dodge feat) stack with each other, unlike most types of bonuses.
