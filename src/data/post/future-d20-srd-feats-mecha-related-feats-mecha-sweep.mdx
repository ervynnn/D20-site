## Mecha Sweep

You can use your mecha to wield improvised weapons and attack several spaces at once.

Prerequisite: Mecha Operation, Power Attack, two free hand slots.

Benefit: You can use your mechas great size and strength, along with your own knowledge of balance and leverage, to pick up a heavy object (such as a large tree or boulder) and attack an area as an attack action. The area affected is a half-circle with a radius equal to your mechas reach. This attack deals damage to all creatures two or more size categories smaller than your mecha within the area. The base damage dealt depends on your mechas size, as given below. Add 1.5 times your mechas Strength bonus to this base damage to determine the total damage for the attack.

| Mecha Size | Damage |
| :--------- | -----: |
| Large      |    1d6 |
| Huge       |    1d8 |
| Gargantuan |    2d6 |
| Colossal   |    2d8 |

Though it can deal significant damage, this form of attack is awkward and unbalancing. You take a 2 penalty to your mechas Defense and on Reflex saves until your next turn.
