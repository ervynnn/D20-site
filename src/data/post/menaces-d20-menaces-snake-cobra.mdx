     Snake, Cobra




     A typical cobra measures about 12 feet long, but some have been known to grow to as much as 18 feet long.

###

     Species Traits




     Bonus Feat: Cobras gain Weapon Finesse (bite) as a bonus feat.




     Poison (Ex): BiteFortitude negates; save DC 10 + 1/2 the cobras Hit Dice + its Constitution modifier; 1d4 Str, 1d4 Dex/1d4 Str, 1d4 Dex.




     Poison Spray (Ex): At will as a ranged touch attack, a spitting cobra can spray its venom at a target up to 10 feet away. When used in this manner, the spitting cobras venom acts as a contact poison. The target must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the cobras Hit Dice + its Constitution modifier) or be blinded and nauseated for 1 minute. A second Fortitude save must be made 1 minute later to negate the venoms secondary damage (same as the initial damage). Eye protection, such as goggles or a full-face visor, negates the blindness effect.




     Scent (Ex): This ability allows a cobra to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.




     Skill Bonuses: A cobra receives a +8 species bonus on Move Silently checks and a +4 species bonus on Hide, Listen, and Spot checks. It applies either its Strength or its Dexterity modifier, whichever is higher, to Climb checks.
