## Swim ([Str](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)) [Armor Penalty](modern-d20-srd-equipment-armor-general)

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): A
successful Swim [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) allows a character to swim one-quarter his or her speed as a [move action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions) or half the character’s speed as a
[full-round](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions) action. Roll once per
round. If the character fails, he or she makes no progress through the water.
If the character fails by 5 or more, he or she goes underwater.

If the character is underwater (from failing a swim [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) or because the character is
swimming underwater intentionally), the character must hold his or her breath.
A character can hold his or her breath for a number of rounds equal to the
character’s Constitution score, but only if the character does nothing but
take [move actions](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions) or [free actions](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types). If the character takes an
[attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) or a [full-round action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions), the amount of breath the
character has remaining is reduced by 1 round. (Effectively, a character in
combat can hold his or her breath only half as long as normal.) After that
period of time, the character must make a [Constitution check](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) (DC 10) every round to continue holding his or her
breath. Each round, the DC of the check increases by 1. If the character fails
the check, the character begins to [drown](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-suffocation-drowning).

The DC for the Swim [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) depends on the water:


<table> <tr><th> Water</th><th> DC </th></tr> <tr><td> Calm water</td><td> 10 </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> Rough water</td><td> 15 </td></tr> <tr><td> Stormy water</td><td> 20 </td></tr> </table>


Each hour that the character swims, make a Swim [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) against DC 20. If the character fails, he
or she becomes fatigued. If the character fails a [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) while fatigued, the character
becomes exhausted. If the character fails a [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) while exhausted, the character becomes
unconscious. Unconscious characters go underwater and immediately begin to
[drown](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-suffocation-drowning).

Try Again?: A new [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) is allowed the round after a [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) is failed.

Special: A character takes a penalty of –1 for every 5 pounds of gear he or
she carries, including [armor](modern-d20-srd-equipment-armor-general) and
[weapons](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-weapons).

A character can [take 10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index)
when making a Swim [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), but can’t [take 20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index).

A character with the [Athletic](modern-d20-srd-feats-athletic) feat gets a +2
bonus on all Swim [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

Time: A Swim [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index)
is either a [move action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions) or a [full-round action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions), as described above.
