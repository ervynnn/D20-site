## Balance (Dex) Armor Penalty


[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): The character can walk on a precarious surface. A successful [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) lets the character move at half his or her speed along the surface as a move action. A failure indicates that the character spends his or her [move
  action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions) keeping his or her balance and does not move. A failure by 5 or more indicates that the character falls.


The difficulty varies with the conditions of the surface.


| Narrow Surface | DC* | Difficult Surface | DC |
| :---------------- | :-----: | :-------------------: | ----: |
| 712 in. wide | 10 | Uneven or angled | 10 |
| 26 in. wide | 15 | Slippery surface | 10 |
| Less than 2 in. wide | 20 |  |  |



*Add +5 to the DC if the narrow surface is slippery or angled; add +10 if it is both slippery and angled.


Being Attacked While Balancing: While balancing, the character is flat-footed
  (the character loses his or her [Dexterity ](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)bonus to [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense), if the character
  has one), unless the character has 5 or more ranks in Balance. If the character
  takes [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage), he or she must make a Balance [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) again to remain standing.



Accelerated Movement: The character can try to cross a precarious surface more quickly than normal. The character can move his or her full speed, but the character takes a 5 penalty on his or her Balance [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). (Moving twice the characters speed in a round requires two [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), one for each [move
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions).)



The character can attempt to charge across a precarious surface. Charging requires one Balance [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) at a 5 penalty for each multiple of the characters speed (or fraction thereof) that the character charges.



Special: A character can [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) when making a Balance check, but cant [take
20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index).



A character with the [Focused](modern-d20-srd-feats-focused) feat gets a +2 bonus on all Balance [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).



Time: Balancing while moving one-half the characters speed is a [move
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions).



Accelerated movement, allowing the character to balance while moving his or her full speed, is also a [move
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions).
