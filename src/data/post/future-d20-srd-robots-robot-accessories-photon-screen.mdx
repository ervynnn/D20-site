## Photon Screen (PL 8)


Using a series of light reflectors molded to the robot's frame, this unit bends light around the robot, rendering it invisible. Any items carried by the robot also become invisible. An invisible robot gains a +40 bonus on Hide checks if immobile, or a +20 bonus if moving. Pinpointing the location of an invisible robot that isn't attempting to hide requires a Spot check (DC 40 if the robot is immobile or DC 20 if the robot is moving).


An invisible robot gains 50% concealment against attacks from creatures that correctly pinpoint its fighting space.


The photon screen is powered by the robot's internal power source.


Purchase DC: 33.


Restriction: Restricted (+2).
