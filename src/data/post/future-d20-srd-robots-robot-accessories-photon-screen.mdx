## Photon Screen (PL 8)


Using a series of light reflectors molded to the robots frame, this unit bends light around the robot, rendering it invisible. Any items carried by the robot also become invisible. An invisible robot gains a +40 bonus on Hide checks if immobile, or a +20 bonus if moving. Pinpointing the location of an invisible robot that isnt attempting to hide requires a Spot check (DC 40 if the robot is immobile or DC 20 if the robot is moving).


An invisible robot gains 50% concealment against attacks from creatures that correctly pinpoint its fighting space.


The photon screen is powered by the robots internal power source.


Purchase DC: 33.


Restriction: Restricted (+2).
