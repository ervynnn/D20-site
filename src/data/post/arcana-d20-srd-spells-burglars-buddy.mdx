## Burglar’s Buddy

Illusion

Level: Arcane 2; Components: V, S, M; Casting Time: Attack action; Range: Long
(400 ft. + 40 ft./level); Area: 15-ft.-radius emanation centered on a
creature, object, or point in space; Duration: 1 minute/level; Saving Throw:
None and Will negates (object); Spell Resistance: Yes and no (object)

This spell suppresses all mechanical or electronic intrusion alarms and alarm
sensors in the affected area. Burglar alarms or other intrusion alarms within
the affected area simply fail to function; sensors for intrusion alarm systems
(such as motion detectors, IR detectors, pressure sensors, electric eyes, and
so forth) also fail to function, sending no signal to monitoring stations.
Video surveillance devices continue to send whatever image they were
photographing the moment when the spell was cast.

Material Component: A camera lens cover.
