## Blindsight (Ex)


Using nonvisual senses, such as sensitivity to vibrations, scent, acute hearing, or echolocation, the creature maneuvers and fights as well as a sighted creature. Invisibility and darkness are irrelevant. The abilitys range is specified in the creatures descriptive text. The creature usually does not need to make [Spot](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot) or [Listen](modern-d20-srd-skills-listen) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics) to notice creatures within range of its blindsight ability.
