     Seed: Armor




     Conjuration (Creation)




     Knowledge (arcane lore) DC: 30; Range: Touch; Target: Creature touched; Duration: Hours (D); Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless); Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)




     You grant a creature additional armor, providing a +4 bonus to Defense. The bonus is either an equipment bonus or a natural armor bonus, whichever you select. Unlike mundane armor, the armor seed provides an intangible protection that entails no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction. Incorporeal creatures cant bypass the armor seed the way they can ignore normal armor. For each additional point of Defense bonus, increase the Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by +2.




     You can also grant a creature a +1 bonus to Defense with different bonus types, including deflection, insight, sacred, or others. For each additional point of Defense bonus in one of these types, increase the Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by +10.
