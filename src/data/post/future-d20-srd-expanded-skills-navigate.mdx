## 
     Navigate (Int)
    



     In a campaign that features space travel or dimensional travel, you can use the Navigate skill to plot a course between planets, star systems, or dimensions.
    



     Check: The rules for plotting a course over a great distance work as described in the Navigate skill description. Aboard a starship, you need a functional Class II sensor array (or better) to plot a course through space. You don't need to make a Navigate check when traveling along a pre-established space route or passing through a dimension gate with a pre-calibrated destination.
    



     Time: Plotting a course is a full-round action.
