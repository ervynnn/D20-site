##  Small Characters

Small characters (such as gnomes, goblins, and halflings) gain a +1 size bonus
to Defense, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on Hide
checks. They suffer a –4 penalty on grapple checks.

Small characters’ lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of
Medium characters.

Small characters generally move about two-thirds as fast as Medium characters
(goblins are exceptions).

Small characters must use smaller weapons than Medium characters. They must
use two hands to wield a weapon of Medium, and a weapon must be of Tiny size
or smaller for them to consider it as a light weapon.

Armor for Small characters can be chopped down from extant protective outfits.
It costs the same as Medium armor and weighs half as much. A Medium or larger
creature cannot wear armor sized for a Small character.
