## PL 9 And Higher


Generally, these Progress Levels are beyond reach or comprehension, although isolated worlds or undiscovered species may exist that have access to them. In many cases, the signature technologies of an earlier age are abandoned in favor of more elegant and more powerful technologies.


Practical control of matter at the subatomic level, the ability to travel through time, or the power to fold space to shorten travel distances may be possible at this stage of technological development.
