## Persistent Power [Metapsionic]


You make one of your powers last all day.


Prerequisite: Extend Power.


Benefit: A persistent power has a duration of 24 hours. The persistent power must have a personal range or a fixed range; you cant use this feat on a power with a variable range, or on a power with an instantaneous duration. Note that you must concentrate on some powers to use their effects (for example, detect psionics and detect thoughts); concentration on such a power is an attack or move action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. A persistent power costs a number of power points equal to its standard cost +8.
