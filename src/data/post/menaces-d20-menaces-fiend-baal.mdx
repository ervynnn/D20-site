## 
     Baal (Unique Archfiend)
    



     The archfiend Baal feeds on the corruption of mortals who hunger for wealth and power. As the gap between rich and poor grows ever wider, Baal grows ever more powerful. In this age of nearly limitless corporate expansion and official policies that favor greed and dehumanization, his power is at an all-time high.
    



     Alternate Form (Su): At will as a free action, Baal can assume the form of a human male or revert to his normal form. He can retain either form indefinitely.
    



     Aura of Greed (Su): Once per day as a free action, Baal can create an aura of greed extending out from his body in a 20-foot radius. Except as noted here, the effect functions like the psionic power domination (manifester level 10th). Each creature within this area must make a successful Will save (DC 21) or be overcome with greed. A creature that fails its saving throw must immediately attack another random creature within 60 feet (possibly even Baal himself) and attempt to take its valuables. If no target is within reach, the affected creature must move toward a randomly chosen target it can see and attack it as soon as possible. This effect is Charisma-based and lasts for 1d4 rounds. As a move action, Baal can specify one creature for other affected creatures to attack instead of allowing random targeting. In this case, the Will save DC drops to 15.
    



     Damage Reduction 10/+2 (Su): Baal ignores the first 10 points of damage dealt by any weapon with a magical bonus lower than +2. In campaigns without magic weapons, the GM can either disregard Baals damage reduction or apply it only to certain types of weapons (ballistic, bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, or sonic/concussion).
    



     Fear Aura (Su): At will as a free action, Baal can create an aura of fear in a 20-foot radius around himself. This effect is otherwise identical to that of a fear spell (caster level 10th; Will DC 21). A creature that succeeds on the saving throw cannot be affected again by Baals fear aura for 24 hours.
    



     Immunities (Ex): Baal is immune to fire and poison.
    



     Resistances (Ex): Baal has cold resistance 20 and electricity resistance 20.
