## 
    Gene Therapy Templates
   



    The potential uses of gene therapy are not limited to special abilities. GMs can simulate just about any simple modification by creating templates that characters can acquire by undergoing the proper program of gene therapy. This is identical to the process described above, except that the GM must set the value for the DC and the number of successful saves required. Use the table above as a guide.
   



    Below are several example gene therapy templates.
