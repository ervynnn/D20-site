## 
     Skill Chip (PL 5)
    



     A skill chip enables a robot to gain up to 8 ranks in any one of the following skills: Computer Use, Demolitions, Disable Device, Listen, Repair, Search, or Spot. A robot can have multiple skill chips. However, skill chips do not allow a robot to benefit from skill synergy.
    



     A skill chip can be erased and reprogrammed with 12 hours of work and a successful Computer Use check (DC 20 + number of skill ranks emulated by the software).
    



     A Techie or a Technosavant can reprogram a skill chip in 1 hour and can modify it to hold as many ranks as he has in the emulated skill.
    



     Purchase DC: 4 Ã— number of skill ranks.
