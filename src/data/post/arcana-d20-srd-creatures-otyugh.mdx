##  Otyugh

Otyughs weigh 500–750 pounds. They speak one local language.

###  Species Traits

Otyughs have the following traits:

Darkvision (Ex): Otyughs can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is
black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and otyughs can
function with no light at all.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the otyugh must hit an opponent at
least one size category smaller than itself with a tentacle attack. If it gets
a hold, it can constrict (see below).

Constrict (Ex): An otyugh deals automatic tentacle damage to a creature
smaller than itself with a successful grapple check.

Disease (Ex): An otyugh’s bite carries a nasty disease called filth fever.
Filth fever—bite: Fortitude save (DC 16) negates; incubation period 1d3 days;
initial and secondary damage 1d3 Dex and 1d3 Con.

Skill Bonus: An otyugh gains a +8 species bonus on Hide checks when in its
lair, due to its natural coloration.
