##  Shadow Creatures and the Modern World

Humans cling steadfastly to the reality that they wish to be true, resisting
every piece of evidence that suggests that the world isn’t the way they
believe it to be. Only a relative few make up the “aware minority,” those
humans who have experienced a Shadow event and seen it for more or less what
it was. The majority, the mundanes, find comfort in translating kobolds with
swords into knife-wielding muggers and malicious spirits into tricks of the
light. A magical effect might be fireworks or a weather peculiarity. Never
underestimate the human mind’s power to deceive itself and maintain a level of
comfort.

Those who subconsciously delude themselves do so for the sake of their fragile
sanity. Those who know and understand at least some aspect of the Shadow tide
maintain the secret to avoid ridicule or investigation, as well as to protect
the public illusion of a sane, mundane world.

In addition, since Shadow creatures really don’t belong to this reality, they
have a tendency to slowly fade away. Some of them disappear within 1d4 rounds
of dying (being reduced to –10 hit points), and none remain in this reality
for more than 1d4 hours before the tide of Shadow reclaims them.
