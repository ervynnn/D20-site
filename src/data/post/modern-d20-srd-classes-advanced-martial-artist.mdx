### Class Features




    The following features pertain to the Martial Artist advanced class.

### Living Weapon




    The Martial Artist attacks with either fist interchangeably, or even with elbows, knees, and feet. This means that the Martial Artist may even make unarmed strikes when his or her hands are full, and there is no such thing as an off-hand
    [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll)
    for a Martial Artist striking unarmed.




    The Martial Artist also deals more
    [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
    with unarmed strikes. At 1st level, the martial artist deals 1d6 points of
    [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
    with an unarmed strike. At 4th level,
    [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
    increases to 1d8. At 8th level, it increases to 1d10.




    This is an increase to
    [Combat  Martial Arts](modern-d20-srd-feats-combat-martial-arts)
damage; this has no effect on
[Brawl](modern-d20-srd-feats-brawl)
.

### Flying Kick




    Starting at 2nd level, a Martial Artist can use a charge to deliver a devastating flying kick to an opponent. At the end of this charge, the martial artist adds his or her class level as a bonus to the
    [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
    he or she deals with an unarmed strike.

### Bonus

     Feats





    At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Martial Artist gets a bonus
    [feat](modern-d20-srd-feats-index)
    . The bonus
    [feat](modern-d20-srd-feats-index)
    must be selected from the following list, and the Martial Artist must meet all the prerequisites of the
    [feat](modern-d20-srd-feats-index)
    to select it.

[Acrobatic](modern-d20-srd-feats-acrobatic)
,
[Advanced Combat Martial Arts](modern-d20-srd-feats-advanced-combat-martial-arts)
,
[Archaic Weapons Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-archaic-weapons-proficiency)
,
[Combat Reflexes](modern-d20-srd-feats-combat-reflexes)
,
[Combat Throw](modern-d20-srd-feats-combat-throw)
,
[Elusive Target](modern-d20-srd-feats-elusive-target)
,
[Exotic Melee Weapon Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-exotic-melee-weapons-proficiency)
,
[Improved Combat Throw](modern-d20-srd-feats-improved-combat-throw)
,
[Improved Combat Martial Arts](modern-d20-srd-feats-improved-combat-martial-arts)
,
[Unbalance Opponent](modern-d20-srd-feats-unbalance-opponent)
.

### Iron Fist




    At 5th level, a Martial Artist gains the ability to spend 1
    [action  point](modern-d20-srd-basics-action-points)
to increase the
[damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
he or she deals to a single opponent with a single unarmed strike. The martial artist declares the use of the
[action point](modern-d20-srd-basics-action-points)
after making a successful
[unarmed strike](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll)
. The result of the
[action point](modern-d20-srd-basics-action-points)
roll is added to the
[damage roll](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
for that
[attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll)
.

    At 10th level, this ability improves. The Martial Artist now adds the result

of the
[action point](modern-d20-srd-basics-action-points)
roll to all successful attacks he or she makes in a round.

### Flurry of Blows




    At 7th level, a Martial Artist gains the ability to strike with a flurry of blows at the expense of accuracy. The Martial Artist must be unarmored to use this talent, and he or she must make unarmed strikes to gain the benefit. With a flurry of blows, the Martial Artist may make one extra
    [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll)
    in a round at his or her highest
    [base  attack bonus](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-bonus)
. This attack and each other attack made in the round take a –2 penalty. This ability can only be used when taking the
[full attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions)
. The penalty applies to all attacks for one full round, including
[attacks of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity)
.
