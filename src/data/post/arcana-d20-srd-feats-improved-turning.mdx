##  Improved Turning

Your turning or rebuke attempts are more powerful than normal.

Prerequisites: Ability to turn or rebuke a creature type.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on your turning checks. This feat may be
taken multiple times, though each time must be applied to a different creature
type which you may normally turn.
