### Class Features


The following features pertain to the Mecha Jockey advanced class.


Mecha Weapon Proficiency
At 1st level, the Mecha Jockey gains the bonus feat Mecha Weapon Proficiency.


Luv My Mecha
Starting at 2nd level, a Mecha Jockey gains a bonus on Drive, Pilot, and Repair checks when applied to a mecha he designates as familiar. The same bonus is applied to the Mecha Jockey's attack rolls with the mecha's ranged weapons. This bonus is +1 at 2nd level and increases by 1 every three levels thereafter (+2 at 5th level, +3 at 8th level).


To designate a mecha as familiar, the Mecha Jockey must have operated it for at least one month. Minor changes and upgrades to the mecha don't affect familiarity, but if the Mecha Jockey switches to a mecha with a different size, different superstructure, different flight system, or more than one new weapon, he must operate it for at least one month before he is familiar with it. A Mecha Jockey can be familiar with only one mecha at a time.


Bonus Feat
At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Mecha Jockey gains a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Mecha Jockey must meet all the prerequisites of the feat to select it. Advanced F irearms Proficiency, Advanced Mecha Operation, Burst Fire, Cleave, Combat Expertise, Dead Aim, Dodge, Double Tap, Far Shot, Force Stop, Gearhead, Great Cleave, Hair Trigger, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Disarm, Improved Sunder, Improved Trip, Mecha Crush, Mecha Fling, Mecha Operation, Mecha Sweep, Mecha Trample, Mecha Weapon Boost, Mobility, Personal Firearms Proficiency, Point Blank Shot, Power Attack, Precise Shot, Shot on the Run, Skip Shot, Spring Attack, Strafe, Stun Mecha, Thruster Blast, Weapon Focus (mecha weapon only), Whirlwind Attack.


Mecha Feint
At 4th level, a Mecha Jockey operating a mecha can make a Bluff check in combat as a move action (instead of an attack action). He receives a +2 bonus on the Bluff check made to feint in melee combat.


If the Mecha Jockey has the Improved Feint feat, his bonus on Bluff checks made to feint increases to +4 while operating a mecha.


Evasive Action
At 7th level, the Mecha Jockey can make a Drive, Pilot, or Tumble check (as appropriate) to lessen the damage dealt by a successful attack against his mecha. If the check result exceeds the attack roll, the damage is reduced by half (round fractions down, minimum of 1 point of damage). The Mecha Jockey can make an evasive action check once per round.


Improved Evasive Action
At 10th level, the Mecha Jockey's evasive action ability improves. A successful Drive, Pilot, or Tumble check negates all damage dealt by the attack.
