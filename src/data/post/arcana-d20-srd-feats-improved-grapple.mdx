##  Improved Grapple

You are skilled at grappling opponents.

Prerequisites: Brawl, Dexterity 13.

**Benefit:** You do not provoke an attack of opportunity when you make a touch
attack to start a grapple. You also gain a +4 competence bonus on all grapple
checks (regardless of whether you started the grapple).

Normal: Characters without this feat provoke an attack of opportunity when
they initiate a grapple.
