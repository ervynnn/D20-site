     Improved Grapple




     You are skilled at grappling opponents.




     Prerequisites: Brawl, Dexterity 13.





      Benefit:

     You do not provoke an attack of opportunity when you make a touch attack to start a grapple. You also gain a +4 competence bonus on all grapple checks (regardless of whether you started the grapple).




     Normal: Characters without this feat provoke an attack of opportunity when they initiate a grapple.
