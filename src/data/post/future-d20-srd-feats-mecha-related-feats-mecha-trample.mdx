## 
    Mecha Trample
   



    Your mecha can knock down and crush opponents.
   



    Prerequisite: Mecha Operation, base attack bonus +4.
   



    Benefit: When you attempt to overrun an opponent while operating a mecha, the target may not choose to avoid your mecha. If your mecha knocks down the target, your mecha may make one free slam attack against the target, gaining a +4 bonus on the attack roll because the target is prone.
