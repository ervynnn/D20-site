## 
     Holo Screen (PL 7)
    



     A holo screen unit projects a holographic image around the robot, making it appear as something else of roughly similar proportions occupying the same amount of space. For instance, it could make a Gargantuan robot look like a massive outcropping of rock or make a Fine robot look like a housefly.
    



     Although the holographic projection appears real, physical objects can pass through it without difficulty. If the robot moves, the holographic image moves as well. Attacks made against the robot are treated as though it had 20% concealment, since the projected image may not perfectly match the robot's true proportions. A holo screen is powered by the robot's internal power source.
