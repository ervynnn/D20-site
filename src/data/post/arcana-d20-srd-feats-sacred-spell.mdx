     Sacred Spell [Metamagic]




     You can cast spells imbued with divine energy.





      Benefit:

     Half of the damage dealt by a sacred spell is converted into divine energy, and as such is not prevented by abilities or spells that reduce or prevent damage from a particular type of energy. For example, half the damage from a sacred flaming wrath spell would not be negated by fire resistance or fire immunity. Only divine spells that deal damage may be made into sacred spells.




     A sacred spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spells actual level.
