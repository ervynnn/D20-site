## 
     Toxic Sludge
    


### 
     Species Traits
    



     Acid (Ex): A toxic sludge is composed of caustic chemicals that dissolve any substance except stone and metal. A toxic sludges slam attack deals 1d4 points of acid damage in addition to the normal bludgeoning damage.
    



     Blindsight (Ex): A toxic sludge is blind but can ascertain all creatures and objects within 40 feet just as a sighted creature would. Beyond that range, all targets have total concealment with respect to the toxic sludge.
    



     Expansion (Ex): A toxic sludge absorbs the bodies of creatures it has killed in battle. This process takes a number of rounds depending on the size of the corpse: Diminutive or smaller 1, Tiny 2, Small 4, Medium-size 8, Large 16, Huge 32, Gargantuan 64, and Colossal 128. The sludge grows by 1 Hit Die for every 16 rounds it spends consuming bodies, to a maximum of 45 Hit Dice.
    



     Immunities (Ex): Toxic sludges are immune to acid, electricity, and cold damage. If a cold attack deals damage equal to or greater than a toxic sludges Constitution score, the toxic sludge is affected as though by a slow spell.
    



     Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the toxic sludge must hit an opponent at least one size category smaller than itself with its slam attack. If it gets a hold, it automatically deals slam damage each round that the hold is maintained, and it can constrict in the same round.
    



     Ooze: A toxic sludge has the traits and immunities common to oozes.
    



     Toxic Fumes (Ex): Any creature that comes within 10 feet of a toxic sludge must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the toxic sludges Hit Dice + its Constitution modifier) or take 1d4 points of Strength damage. A new save must be made each round a creature remains within 10 feet of the toxic sludge.
