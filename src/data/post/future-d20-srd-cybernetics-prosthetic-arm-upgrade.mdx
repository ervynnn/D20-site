## 
    Prosthetic Arm Upgrade (PL 6)
   



    This upgraded version of the PL 5 prosthetic arm not only replaces a lost or destroyed arm but is also more resilient than its technological predecessor.
   



    Benefit: The prosthetic arm upgrade duplicates the function of its biological counterpart but has a greater hardness and more hit points than the basic PL 5 prosthesis.
   



    Type: External.
   



    Hardness/Hit Points: 5/10.
   



    Base Purchase DC: 19.
   



    Restriction: None.
