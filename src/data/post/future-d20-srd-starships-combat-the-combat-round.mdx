## The Combat Round


As with character-scale combat, each round of starship combat represents about 6 seconds in the game world.


Each round's activity begins with the starship with the highest initiative result and then proceeds, in order, from there.


Each round of a combat uses the same initiative order. When a starship's turn comes up in the initiative sequence, that ship performs its entire round's worth of actions. (For exceptions, see Attacks of Opportunity and Special Initiative Actions.)
