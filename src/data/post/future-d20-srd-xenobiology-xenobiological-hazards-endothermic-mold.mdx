## 
    Endothermic Mold (CR 2)
   



    Endothermic mold feeds on warmth, siphoning heat from anything around it. A patch of endothermic mold is red-brown in color and 5 feet in diameter, and the temperature is always cold in a 30- foot radius around it. Living creatures within 5 feet take 3d6 points of nonlethal cold damage. Fire brought within 5 feet of the mold causes it to instantly double in size.
   



    A 5-foot patch of endothermic mold is destroyed if it takes 5 or more points of cold damage.
