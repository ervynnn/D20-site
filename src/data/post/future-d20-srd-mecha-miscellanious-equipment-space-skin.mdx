## 
    Space Skin (PL 6)
   



    Space skin colloquially refers to a series of environmental stabilizers that allow the mecha operator (and other living creatures aboard the mecha) to ignore the effects of vacuum, thus enabling the mecha to operate in space.
   



    A mecha equipped with space skin has one less equipment slot.
