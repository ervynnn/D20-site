## Concealed Weapons and Objects

It’s assumed that, when attempting to conceal a weapon or other object, a
character is wearing appropriate clothing.

Drawing a concealed weapon is more difficult than drawing a regularly
holstered weapon, and normally requires an attack action. Keeping the weapon
in an easier-to-draw position makes concealing it more difficult.

### [Sleight of Hand](modern-d20-srd-skills-sleight-of-hand)
[Checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index)

To conceal a weapon or other object, make a [Sleight of Hand](modern-d20-srd-skills-sleight-of-hand) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). A character concealing an object before he or she heads out into
public can usually [take 10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) unless he or she is rushed, trying to conceal it when others
might see, or under other unusual constraints. [Sleight of Hand](modern-d20-srd-skills-sleight-of-hand) can be used untrained in this
instance, but the character must [take 10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index).

### Size and Concealment

The object’s size affects the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) result, as shown on Table: Concealing Weapons and
Objects. The type of holster used or clothing worn, and any attempt to make a
weapon easier to draw, can also affect the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

### Spotting Concealed Objects

Noticing a concealed weapon or other object requires a [Spot](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). The DC varies: If the target made a roll when concealing an object,
the DC of the [Spot](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) to notice the object is the same as
the target’s check result (an opposed check, in other words). If the target
took 10 on his or her [Sleight of Hand](modern-d20-srd-skills-sleight-of-hand)
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), use this
formula:

[Spot](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot) DC = Target’s [Sleight of Hand](modern-d20-srd-skills-sleight-of-hand) skill modifier (including
modifiers from Table: Concealing Weapons and Objects) + 10

An observer attempting to spot a concealed object receives a –1 penalty for
every 10 feet between him or herself and the target, and a –5 penalty if
distracted.

Patting someone down for a hidden weapon requires a similar
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). However,
the skill employed is [Search](modern-d20-srd-skills-search), and the searcher
gets a +4 circumstance bonus for the hands-on act of frisking the target. Some
devices may also offer bonuses under certain circumstances (a metal detector
offers a bonus to [Search](modern-d20-srd-skills-search)
[checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) to find
metal objects, for example).

### Spotting Concealable Armor

Concealable armor can be worn under clothing if the wearer wants it to go
unnoticed. Don’t use the modifiers from Table: Concealing Weapons and Objects
when wearing concealable armor. Instead, anyone attempting to notice the armor
must make a [Spot](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 30).
