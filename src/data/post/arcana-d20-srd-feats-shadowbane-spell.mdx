## Shadowbane Spell [Metamagic]


Your spells are more effective against creatures of Shadow.


Benefit: Creatures of Shadow and characters with shadowblood (humans of shadow heritage, or elves and dwarves, for example) take a 4 penalty on the spells saving throw.


This feat cannot improve spells that do not allow saves.


A shadowbane spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spells actual level.
