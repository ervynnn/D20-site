## Shadowbane Spell [Metamagic]

Your spells are more effective against creatures of Shadow.

**Benefit:** Creatures of Shadow and characters with shadowblood (humans of
shadow heritage, or elves and dwarves, for example) take a –4 penalty on the
spell’s saving throw.

This feat cannot improve spells that do not allow saves.

A shadowbane spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell’s
actual level.
