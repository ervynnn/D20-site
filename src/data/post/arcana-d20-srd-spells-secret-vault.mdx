[Spells](arcana-d20-srd-spells-index) > Secret Vault

## Secret Vault

Conjuration (Summoning)

Level: Arcane 5; Components: V, S, F; Casting Time: 10 minutes; Range: See
text; Target: One chest and up to 1 cu. ft. of goods/caster level; Duration:
60 days or until discharged; Saving Throw: None; Spell Resistance: No

You hide a briefcase, backpack, dufflebag, or similar item in an
extradimensional space for up to 60 days and can retrieve it at will. The item
used as a secret vault can contain up to 1 cubic foot of material per caster
level (regardless of the itemâ€™s actual size). If you put anything living
inside the secret vault, the spell fails. Once you cast the spell, the item
and its contents disappear. You can retrieve it anytime thereafter by
concentrating (an attack or move action), and it appears next to you.

To create the secret vault, you cast the spell while touching both the full-
size container and a miniscule replica of it. The container and anything
within it or touching it (subject to the volume limitation above) vanishes
into an extradimensional space. You need the miniature replica to recall the
container. After 60 days, the container reappears in your hand whether you
wish it to or not.

Focus: A briefcase, duffle bag, or similar container prepared with expensive
and rare reagents, as well as a miniscule replica of it. The actual storage
container and the miniature replica have a combined purchase DC of 25.
