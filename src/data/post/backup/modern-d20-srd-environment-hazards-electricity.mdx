    Electrical hazards come in many forms, including stun guns, downed power lines, and electric security fences. Table: Electricity Damage gives
    [
     damage
    ](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
    values for various electrical hazards based on relative voltage. A character can make a Fortitude
    [
     saving

throw
](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
to reduce the damage by half. If that character is not grounded or is otherwise insulated from the current, a successful

indicates that no damage is suffered.
