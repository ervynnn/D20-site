## Firearms

The most basic form of attack with a firearm is a single shot. One attack is one pull of the trigger and fires one bullet at one target.

The [Personal
Firearms Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-personal-firearms-proficiency) feat allows a character to make this sort of [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) without penalty. If a character isnt proficient in personal firearms, he or she takes a 4 penalty on [attacks](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) with that type of weapon.

A number of other feats allow a character to deal extra damage when he or she fires more than one bullet as part of a single attack at a single target. (If a character doesnt have those feats, he or she can still fire more than one bulletbut the extra bullets dont have any effect, and are just wasted ammunition.)

As with all forms of ranged weapons, attacking with a firearm while within a threatened square provokes an [attack
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity).

Because of the weapons unwieldy shape and size, an attacker using a longarm takes a 4 penalty on attacks against adjacent opponents.

### Autofire

If a ranged weapon has an automatic rate of fire, a character may set it on autofire. Autofire affects an area and everyone in it, not a specific creature. The character targets a 10-foot-by-10-foot area and makes an [attack
roll](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll); the targeted area has an effective Defense of 10. (If the character does not have the [Advanced
Firearms Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-advanced-firearms-proficiency) feat, he or she takes a 4 penalty on the attack roll.) If the attack succeeds, every creature within the affected area must make a [Reflex
save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) (DC 15) or take the weapons damage. Autofire shoots 10 bullets, and can only be used if the weapon has 10 bullets in it.

Autofire is not the same thing as burst fire, which involves firing a short burst at a specific target. Firing a burst requires the [Burst
Fire](modern-d20-srd-feats-burst-fire) feat. If a character fires a blast of automatic fire at a specific target without the [Burst
Fire](modern-d20-srd-feats-burst-fire) feat, its treated as a standard attack. The attack, if successful, only deals normal damageall the extra ammunition the character fired is wasted.

Some firearmsparticularly machine gunsonly have autofire settings and cant normally fire single shots.
