## The Effects of Speed

A fast-moving [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) is harder to hit than a stationary onebut its also harder to control, and to attack from.

As shown on [Table:
Vehicle Speeds and Modifiers](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed), when a [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) travels at [street
speed](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-declaring-speed) or faster, it gains a bonus to [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense). However, that speed brings along with it a penalty on all [skill
checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics) and [attack
rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) made by characters aboard the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)including [Drive](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics) to control the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) and [attacks](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) made from it.
