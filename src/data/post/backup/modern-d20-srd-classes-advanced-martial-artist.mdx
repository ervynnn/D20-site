    Class Features




    The following features pertain to the Martial Artist advanced class.

###

    Living Weapon




    The Martial Artist attacks with either fist interchangeably, or even with elbows, knees, and feet. This means that the Martial Artist may even make unarmed strikes when his or her hands are full, and there is no such thing as an off-hand
    [
     attack
    ](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll)
    for a Martial Artist striking unarmed.




    The Martial Artist also deals more
    [
     damage
    ](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
    with unarmed strikes. At 1st level, the martial artist deals 1d6 points of
    [
     damage
    ](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
    with an unarmed strike. At 4th level,
    [
     damage
    ](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
    increases to 1d8. At 8th level, it increases to 1d10.




    This is an increase to
    [
     Combat

Martial Arts
](modern-d20-srd-feats-combat-martial-arts)
damage; this has no effect on
[
Brawl
](modern-d20-srd-feats-brawl)
.

###

    Starting at 2nd level, a Martial Artist can use a charge to deliver a devastating flying kick to an opponent. At the end of this charge, the martial artist adds his or her class level as a bonus to the

](modern-d20-srd-basics-action-points)
to increase the
[
damage
](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)

roll is added to the

](modern-d20-srd-basics-action-points)
roll to all successful attacks he or she makes in a round.

    ](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll)
    in a round at his or her highest
