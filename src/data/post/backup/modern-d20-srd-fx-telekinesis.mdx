## Telekinesis

Transmutation

[Level](modern-d20-srd-fx-level): [Mage](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-mage) 5; [Components](modern-d20-srd-fx-components): V, S; [Casting Time](modern-d20-srd-fx-casting-time); [Attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) [Range](modern-d20-srd-fx-range): Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level); Target or Targets: See text; [Duration](modern-d20-srd-fx-duration): Concentration (up to 1 round/level) or instantaneous (see text); [Saving Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): Will negates (object) (see text); [Spell Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance): Yes (object) (see text)

The caster can move objects or creatures by concentrating on them. Depending on the version selected, the spell can provide either a gentle, sustained force or a single short, violent thrust.

Sustained Force: A sustained force moves a creature or object weighing up to 25 pounds per caster level up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect against itself or against an object it possesses with a successful [Will
save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) or with [spell
resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance).

This version of the spell lasts up to 1 round per caster level, but it ends if the caster ceases concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or both. An object cannot be moved beyond the casterÂ’s range. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If the caster ceases concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops.

An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand, if the force required is within the weight limitation.

Violent Thrust: Alternatively, the spell energy can be expended in a single round. The caster can hurl one or more objects or creatures that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet/level of all the objects. The caster can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level.

The caster must succeed at [attack
rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using his or her base attack bonus + [Intelligence](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier.
Weapons deal their normal damage (with no [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) bonus). Other objects cause
[damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6
points of [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects).

Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed [Will
saves](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell. If a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet.
