## Spring Attack

Prerequisites: [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) 13, [Dodge](modern-d20-srd-feats-dodge), [Mobility](modern-d20-srd-feats-mobility), base attack bonus +4.

Benefit: When using an [attack
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) with a melee weapon, the character can move both before and after the attack, provided that the total distance moved is not greater than the charaters speed.

Moving in this way does not provoke an [attack
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity) from the defender the character is attacking (though it can provoke [attacks
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity) from others, as normal).

A character cant use this feat if he or she is carrying a [heavy
load](modern-d20-srd-equipment-carrying-capacity) or wearing [heavy
armor](modern-d20-srd-equipment-armor-heavy).
