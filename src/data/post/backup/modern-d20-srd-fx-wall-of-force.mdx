    A wall of force spell creates an invisible wall of force. The wall of force cannot move, it is immune to
    [
     damage
    ](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
    of all kinds, and it is unaffected by
    [
     dispel

magic
](modern-d20-srd-fx-dispel-magic)
. Spells, breath weapons, and flamethrowers cannot pass through the wall in either direction, although
[

](modern-d20-srd-fx-dimension-door)
can bypass the barrier.
[
Gaze
attacks
](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-gaze)
can operate through the wall of force.

    The caster can form the wall into a flat, vertical plane whose area is up to one 10-foot square per level, or into a sphere or hemisphere with a radius of up to 1 foot per level.




    The wall of force must be continuous and unbroken when formed. If its surface is broken by any object or creature, the spell fails.
