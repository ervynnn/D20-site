## Frightful Presence

Prerequisites: [Charisma](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) 15, [Intimidate](modern-d20-srd-skills-intimidate) 9 ranks.

Benefit: When the character uses this feat, all opponents within 10 feet who have fewer levels than the character must make a Will [saving
throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) (DC 10 + ½ the characters level + the characters [Charisma](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier). An opponent who fails his or her save is shaken, taking a 2 penalty on [attack
rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll), [saves](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws), and [skill
checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) for a number of rounds equal to 1d6 + the characters [Charisma](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier. The character can use the feat once per round as a [free
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types).

A successful [save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) indicates that the opponent is immune to the characters use of this feat for 24 hours. This feat does not affect creatures with an Intelligence of 3 or lower.

If the character has the [Renown](modern-d20-srd-feats-renown) feat, the Will [saving
throws](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) DC increases by 5.
