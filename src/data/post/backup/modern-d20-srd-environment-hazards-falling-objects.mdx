    Falling Objects




    Objects that fall upon characters (or creatures or vehicles) deal
    [
     damage
    ](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
    based on their size and the distance fallen, as noted on Table: Damage from Falling Objects.




    Objects deal the initial damage given in Table: Damage from Falling Objects if they fall 10 feet or less. An object deals an additional 1d6 points of
    [
     damage
    ](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
    for every 10-foot increment it falls beyond the first (to a maximum of 20d6 points of
    [
     damage
    ](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
    ). Objects of Fine size are too small to deal
    [
     damage
    ](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
    , regardless of the distance fallen.




    A successful
    [
     Reflex save
    ](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
    indicates that the target takes half
    [
     damage
    ](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
    . The size of the falling object determines the
    [
     save
    ](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
    DC.




    If the save fails by 10 or more, and the object is at least three size categories larger than the character, the character is pinned under the fallen object. A pinned character cannot move but is not helpless. The character can make a
    [
     Strength
    ](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)
    check to lift the object off him or herself or an
    [

[
check

(DC 20) to get out from underneath. The GM can modify the DCs for these checks based on the circumstances.
