## Tumble (Dex) Trained

    Only; Armor Penalty

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): A character can land softly when he or she falls, tumble past opponents in combat, or tumble through opponents.

Land Softly: The character can make a Tumble [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 15) when [falling](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-falling). If the check succeeds, treat the fall as if it were 10 feet shorter when determining [damage](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-falling).

Tumble past Opponents: With a successful Tumble [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 15), the character can weave, dodge, and roll up to 20 feet through squares adjacent to opponents, risking no [attacks
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity). Failure means the character moves as planned, but provokes [attacks
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity) as normal.

Tumble through Opponents: With a successful Tumble [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 25), the character can roll, jump, or dive through squares occupied by opponents, moving over, under, or around them as if they werent there. Failure means the character moves as planned, but provokes [attacks
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) as normal.

Try Again?: No.

Special: A character with 5 or more ranks in Tumble gains a +3 dodge bonus to [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) (instead of the normal +2) when fighting [defensively](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense), and a +6 dodge bonus (instead of the normal +4) when engaging in [total
defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense).
A character can [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) when making a Tumble [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), but cant [take
20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index).

A character with the [Acrobatic](modern-d20-srd-feats-acrobatic) feat and at least 1 rank in this skill gets a +2 bonus on all Tumble [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

Time: A character can try to reduce damage from a fall as a reaction once
per fall. A character can attempt to tumble as a [free
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types) that must be performed
as part of a [move action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions).
