## Starting Occupation

A hero may hold other jobs as his or her career unfolds, but the benefits of a starting occupation are only applied once, at the time of character creation.

Many starting occupations have a prerequisite that the character must meet to qualify for the occupation. Each occupation provides a number of additional permanent class [skills](modern-d20-srd-skills-index) that the character can select from a list of choices. Once selected, a permanent class [skill](modern-d20-srd-skills-index) is always considered to be a class [skill](modern-d20-srd-skills-index) for the character. If the [skill](modern-d20-srd-skills-index) selected is already a class [skill](modern-d20-srd-skills-index) for the character, he or she also gains a one-time competence bonus for that [skill](modern-d20-srd-skills-index).

Some starting occupations provide a [Reputation](modern-d20-srd-reputation-index) bonus or a bonus [feat](modern-d20-srd-feats-index) (in addition to the two [feats](modern-d20-srd-feats-index) a 1st-level character already receives). A character still must meet any prerequisites for these bonus [feats](modern-d20-srd-feats-index). Finally, a starting occupation increases the characters [Wealth
bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus).

Choose one occupation from the available selections and apply the benefits to the character as noted in the occupations description.
