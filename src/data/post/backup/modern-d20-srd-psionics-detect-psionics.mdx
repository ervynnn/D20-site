     The manifester detects psionic auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how long the manifester studies a particular area or subject.




     1st Round: Presence or absence of psionic auras.




     2nd Round: Number of different psionic auras and the strength of the strongest aura.




     3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, the manifester can make Psicraft checks to determine the discipline involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + power level, or 15 + half manifester level for a nonpower effect.)




     Psionic areas, multiple disciplines, or strong local psionic emanations may confuse or conceal weaker auras.




     Aura Strength: An auras psionic power and strength depend on a powers functioning power level or an items manifester level.

| Functioning Power Level   | Item Manifester Level | Aura Power |
| :------------------------ | :-------------------: | ---------: |
| 0-level or lingering aura |    Lingering aura     |        Dim |
| 1st3rd                    |        1st5th         |      Faint |
| 4th5th                    |                       |   Moderate |

     If an aura falls into more than one category, detect psionics indicates the stronger of the two.

Length Aura Lingers: How long the aura lingers after the source has vacated the area depends on the auras original strength.

| Original Aura Power |         Duration |
| :------------------ | ---------------: |
| Dim                 |         1 minute |
| Faint               |      1d6 minutes |
| Moderate            | 1d6 x 10 minutes |
