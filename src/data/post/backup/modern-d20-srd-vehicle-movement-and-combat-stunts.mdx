## Stunts

Stunts are maneuvers that require a [Drive](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics) to perform successfully. Unsuccessful stunts often result in the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) ending up someplace other than where the driver intended. When this happens, the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) [collides](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming) with any objects in its path. Remember that the check/roll modifier from [Table:
Vehicle Speeds and Modifiers](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed) affects all [Drive ](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive)[checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics) made by the driver and [attack
rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) made by all occupants of the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles).

Avoid Hazard: [Vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) combat rarely occurs on a perfectly flat, featureless plain. When a [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) tries to move through a square occupied by a hazard, the driver must succeed on a [Drive](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics) to avoid the hazard and continue moving.

| Hazard                     |                DC |
| :------------------------- | ----------------: |
| Caltrops                   |                15 |
| Oil slick                  |                15 |
|                            |                   |
| Small (tire, light debris) |                 5 |
| Medium-size (crate)        |                10 |
| Large (pile of wreckage)   |                15 |
| Structure                  | Cannot be avoided |

Structures simply cannot be avoided. Also, if a driver cannot make a [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics) (if he or she has used all his or her actions for the round in performing other stunts), he or she automatically fails to avoid the hazard. In such cases, a [collision](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming) occurs.

The DC to avoid a hazard varies with the nature of the hazard.

On a failed [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics), the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) hits
the obstacle. For caltrops, this means the caltrops make an [attack](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-attack-options) against
the vehicle (see [Caltrops](modern-d20-srd-equipment-professional-equipment-php#caltrops-index)).
An oil slick forces the drive to make a [Drive](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics) (DC 15) to retain control of the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) (see
[Losing
Control](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-losing-control)). Failing to avoid an object results in a [collision](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming) with the
object (see [Collisions
and Ramming](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming)).

Bootleg Turn: By making a bootleg turn, a driver can radically change direction without turning in a loop. However, in so doing, the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) comes to a stop.

Before a [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) can make a bootleg turn, it must move in a straight line at least a number of squares equal to its [turn
number](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed). To make a bootleg turn, simply change the [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) facing to the desired direction. The [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) ends its movement in that location, at [stationary
speed](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed).

The DC for a bootleg turn depends on the change in [facing](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-facing-firing-arcs).

On a failed [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics), instead of [facing](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-facing-firing-arcs) the desired direction, the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) only changes [facing](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-facing-firing-arcs) by 45 degrees. Make a [Drive](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics) to retain control against a DC equal to the DC for the bootleg turn attempted (see [Losing
Control](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-losing-control)).

| Table: Bootleg Turn DC |     |
| :--------------------- | --: |
|                        |     |
| 45 degrees             |   5 |
| 90 degrees             |  10 |
| 135 degrees            |  15 |
| 180 degrees            |  20 |

Dash: With a dash stunt, a driver can increase the [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) [speed](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed) by one category. (This increase is in addition to any [speed
change](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-declaring-speed) made at the beginning of the drivers action; if the driver increased [speed](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed) at that time, he or she can accelerate a total of two categories in the same round.) The [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) total [movement](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-moving) for the round cannot exceed the maximum number of squares for its new [speed
category](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed). (The squares it has already moved before attempting the dash count against this total.)

The DC for a dash is 15. The driver can only succeed at one dash per round.

On a failed check, the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) does not change speed categories.

Hard Brake: With a hard brake stunt, a driver can reduce the [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) [speed](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed) by up to two categories. (This is in addition to any [speed
change](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-declaring-speed) made at the beginning of his action; if the driver reduced [speed](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed) at that time, he or she can drop a total of three categories in the same round.) The [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) [movement](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-moving) for the round ends as soon as it has moved the minimum number of squares for its new [speed
category](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed). (If it has already moved that far before attempting the hard brake, it ends its movement immediately.)

The DC for a hard brake is 15. The driver can only succeed at one hard break per round.

On a failed check, the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-moving) does not change [speed
categories](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed). Make a [Drive](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics) (DC 15) to retain control (see [Losing
Control](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-losing-control)).

Hard Turn: A hard turn allows a [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) to make a turn in a short distance without losing [speed](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed).

A hard turn functions like a 45-degree turn [simple
maneuver](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-simple-maneuvers), except that the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) only needs to move forward a number of squares equal to half its [turn
number](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed) (rounded down).

The DC for a hard turn is 15.

On a failed [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics), the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) continues to move forward a number of squares equal to its [turn
number](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed) before turning, just as with a [simple
45-degree turn](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-simple-maneuvers). Make a [Drive](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics) (DC 15) to retain control (see [Losing
Control](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-losing-control)).

Jump: A driver can attempt to jump his or her [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) across a gap in his
or her path.

To make a jump, the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) must move in a straight line a number of squares equal to its [turn
number](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed). If the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) doesnt have enough [movement](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-moving) left to clear the gap, it must complete the jump at the start of its next turn.

The DC for a jump depends on the width of the gap, modified by the [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) [speed
category](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed).
On a failed [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics), the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) fails to clear the gap, and instead falls into it (or [collides](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming) with the far side). Determine damage as for a [collision](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming) (see [Collisions
and Ramming](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming)).

| Gap Width                          |  DC |
| :--------------------------------- | --: |
| 13 ft. (ditch)                     |  15 |
| 48 ft. (culvert)                   |  20 |
| 815 ft. (creek, small ravine)      |  25 |
| 1625 ft. (narrow road, small pond) |  35 |
| 2640 ft. (wide road, small river)  |  45 |

| Vehicle Speed Category | DC Modifier |
| :--------------------- | ----------: |
| Alley speed            |         +10 |
| Street speed           |          +5 |
| Highway speed          |          +0 |
| All-out                |           5 |

A shallow gap (1 to 3 feet deep) is equivalent to a Medium-size object; the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) may be able to avoid taking [collision](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming) damage from the failed jump by treating the far side as a hazard and then continue moving (see [Avoid
Hazard](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-stunts-php#avoid-hazard-index), above).

A moderately deep gap (4 to 10 feet deep) is equivalent to a Huge object. The [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) can only drive out of the gap if the walls are not too steep.

A deeper gap (11 feet or deeper) is equivalent to a Colossal object. The [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) can only drive out of the gap if the walls are not too steep.

If the gap is filled with water, the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) takes only half [damage](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-damaging-vehicles) from the [collision](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming) with the ground. However, if the water is too deep or the bottom is too soft (GMs discretion), the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) might not be able to move.

Sideswipe: During a [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) movement, a driver can attempt to sideswipe a [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) or other target, either to deal damage without fully [ramming](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming) it or to cause another driver to [lose
control](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-losing-control) of his or her [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles).

At character scale, a [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) must be side by side with its target (that is, occupying the square or squares directly to its side) and [moving](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-moving) in the same direction. Attempting a sideswipe costs 1 square of movement.

At chase scale, the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) must be in the same square as its target and [moving](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-moving) in the same direction. There is no movement cost.

If the stunt is successful, the sideswiping [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) and the target both take [damage](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-damaging-vehicles) as if they had [collided](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming) ([see
Collisions and Ramming](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming)), except that the [collision
multiplier](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming) is 1/4, and the target (or driver of the target [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)) can make a [Reflex
save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) (DC 15) to reduce the damage to both by half. If the target is another [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) the driver must succeed at a [Drive](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics) (DC 15) at the beginning of his or her next action or lose control of the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles).

The DC for a sideswipe is 15. Its modified by the relative size and speed of the target.

| Target Condition                  | DC Modifier |
| :-------------------------------- | ----------: |
| Each size category larger         |           5 |
| Each size category smaller        |          +5 |
| Each speed category of difference |           2 |

On a failed [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics), both vehicles take [damage](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-damaging-vehicles) as though the sideswipe attempt was a success. However, the other driver does not need to make a [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics) to retain control.
