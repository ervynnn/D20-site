## Two-Weapon Fighting

Prerequisite: [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) 13.

Benefit: The characters penalties for fighting with two weapons are lessened by 2 for the primary hand and 6 for the off hand.

The weapons used must both be melee weapons or both be ranged weapons (the character cant mix the types).
