## Glitterdust

Conjuration (Creation)

[Level](modern-d20-srd-fx-level): [Mage](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-mage) 2; [Components](modern-d20-srd-fx-components): V, S, M; [Casting Time](modern-d20-srd-fx-casting-time); [Attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) [Range](modern-d20-srd-fx-range): Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level); [Area](modern-d20-srd-fx-area): Creatures and objects within 10-ft. spread; [Duration](modern-d20-srd-fx-duration): 1 round/level; [Saving Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): Will negates (blinding only); [Spell Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance): Yes

A cloud of particles covers everyone and everything in the area, blinding creatures and visibly outlining invisible things for the duration of the spell. All within the area are covered by the dust, which cannot be removed and continues to sparkle until it fades.

In addition to the obvious effects, a blinded creature suffers a 50% miss chance in combat (all opponents have full [concealment](modern-d20-srd-combat-concealment)), loses any [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) bonus to [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense), grants a +2 bonus on opponents [attack
rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) (they are effectively invisible), moves at half speed, and suffers a 4 penalty on [Search](modern-d20-srd-skills-search) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) and most [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) and [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)-based [skill
checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-checks-index).
