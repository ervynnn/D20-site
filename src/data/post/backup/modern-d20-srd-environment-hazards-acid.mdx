## Acid

Corrosive acids deal [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) each round of exposure. The amount of [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) varies depending on the acidÂ’s strength, as noted on Table: Acid [Damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage).

| Table: Acid [Damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)              |     |      |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :-: | ---: |
|                                                                 |     |      |
| Mild                                                            | 1d6 | 1d10 |
| Potent                                                          | 2d6 | 2d10 |
| Concentrated                                                    | 3d6 | 3d10 |
| \*[Damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) per round of exposure. |     |      |

Acid [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) from an attack reduces [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points). A character fully immersed in acid takes potentially more [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) per round of exposure than a character splashed with acid.

The fumes from most acids are inhaled poisons. Those who come within 5 feet of a large body of acid must make a [Fortitude
save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) (DC 15) or take 1 point of temporary [Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage). A second [save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) must succeed 1 minute later to avoid taking another 1d4 points of [Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) [damage](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores).
