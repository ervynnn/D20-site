## Lesser Concussion

[Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)

Level: [Battle Mind](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-battle-mind) 1; Display: Audible; Manifestation Time: [Attack
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions); Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level); Target: One individual; Duration: Instantaneous; [Saving
Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): Fortitude half; [Power
Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-power-resistance): Yes; Power Point Cost: 1

The target is pummeled with telekinetic force for 1d6 points of [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage). The manifester may choose to have the power deal only nonlethal [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) instead of lethal [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage).

Concussion always affects a target within range that the manifester can see, even if the subject is in melee or has partial [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover) or [concealment](modern-d20-srd-combat-concealment). Inanimate objects canÂ’t be damaged by this power.
