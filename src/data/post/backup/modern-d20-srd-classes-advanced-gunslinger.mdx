### Class Features

The following features pertain to the Gunslinger advanced class.

### Close Combat Shot

At 1st level, a Gunslinger gains the ability to make a [ranged
attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) with a Medium-size or smaller firearm while in a threatened area without provoking an [attack
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity).

### Weapon Focus

At 2nd level, a Gunslinger gains the [Weapon
Focus](modern-d20-srd-feats-weapon-focus) class feature, providing the benefit of the feat with the same name. The Gunslinger must choose a specific personal firearm.

The gunslinger adds +1 to all [attack
rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) you make using the selected personal firearm.

### Bonus Feats

At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Gunslinger gets a bonus [feat](modern-d20-srd-feats-index). The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Gunslinger must meet all the prerequisites of the feat to select it.

[Advanced
Firearms Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-advanced-firearms-proficiency), [Advanced
Two-Weapon Fighting](modern-d20-srd-feats-advanced-two-weapon-fighting), [Burst
Fire](modern-d20-srd-feats-burst-fire), [Dead Aim](modern-d20-srd-feats-dead-aim), [Double
Tap](modern-d20-srd-feats-double-tap), [Far Shot](modern-d20-srd-feats-far-shot), [Improved
Two-Weapon Fighting](modern-d20-srd-feats-improved-two-weapon-fighting), [Precise
Shot](modern-d20-srd-feats-precise-shot), [Quick Draw](modern-d20-srd-feats-quick-draw), [Quick
Reload](modern-d20-srd-feats-quick-reload), [Shot on the
Run](modern-d20-srd-feats-shot-on-the-run), [Skip Shot](modern-d20-srd-feats-skip-shot), [Strafe](modern-d20-srd-feats-strafe), [Two-Weapon
Fighting](modern-d20-srd-feats-two-weapon-fighting).

### Defensive Position

Starting at 4th level, the Gunslinger gains an additional +2 [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover) bonus to [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) and an additional +2 [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover) bonus on [Reflex saves](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) whenever he or she has one-quarter, one-half, three-quarters, or nine-tenths [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover).

### Lightning Shot

Starting at 5th level, a Gunslinger can make a flurry of [ranged
attacks](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) with a personal firearm at the expense of accuracy. With a lightning shot, the Gunslinger may make one extra [ranged
attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) with a personal firearm in a round at his or her highest [base
attack bonus](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-bonus). This attack and each other attack made in the round take a 2 penalty. This ability can only be used when taking the [full
attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions). The penalty applies to all attacks for one full round, including attacks of opportunity.

### Sharp-Shooting

At 7th level, if the Gunslinger uses a personal firearm to [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) a target, the cover bonus to the targets [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) for one-quarter, one-half, three-quarters, or nine-tenths cover is reduced by 2.

### Greater Weapon Focus

At 8th level, a Gunslinger receives a +1 competence bonus on [attack
rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) made with the firearm selected for the [Weapon
Focus](modern-d20-srd-feats-weapon-focus) ability at 2nd level. This bonus stacks with the earlier bonus.

### Bullseye

At 10th level, a Gunslinger becomes so adept at using the firearm to which he or she has applied [Weapon
Focus](modern-d20-srd-feats-weapon-focus) and Greater Weapon Focus that the gunslingers attacks with that firearm can deal extra [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage). With a successful [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll), before [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) is rolled, the gunslinger can spend 1 [action
point](modern-d20-srd-basics-action-points) to deal +3d6 points of [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage).
