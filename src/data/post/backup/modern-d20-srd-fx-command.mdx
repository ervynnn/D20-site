     The caster gives the subject a single command, which he or she obeys to the best of his or her ability at his or her earliest opportunity. The caster may select from the following options.




     Approach: On the subjects turn, the subject moves toward the caster as quickly and directly as possible for 1 round. The subject may do nothing but move during his or her turn, and he or she incurs

of opportunity

for this movement as normal.

     Drop: On the subjects turn, he or she drops whatever he or she is holding. The subject cant pick up any dropped item until his or her next turn.




     Fall: The subject immediately falls to the ground and remains
     [
      prone
     ](modern-d20-srd-combat-favorable-unfavorable-conditions)
     for 1 round. He or she may act normally while prone, but takes any appropriate penalties.




     Flee: On the subjects turn, he or she moves away from the caster as quickly as possible for 1 round. The subject may do nothing but move during his or her turn.




     Halt: The subject stands in place for 1 round. The subject may not take any actions, but may defend him or herself normally.




     If the subject cant carry out the casters command on his or her next turn, the spell automatically fails.
