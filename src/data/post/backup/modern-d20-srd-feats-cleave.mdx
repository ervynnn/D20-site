## Cleave

Prerequisites: [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) 13, [Power
Attack](modern-d20-srd-feats-power-attack).

Benefit: If the character deals an opponent enough [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) to make the opponent drop (either by knocking the opponent out due to [massive
damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-death-dying-healing) or by reducing the opponents [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points) to less than 0), the character gets an immediate extra melee [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) against another opponent adjacent to the character. The character cant take a 5-foot step before making this extra attack. The extra attack is with the same weapon and at the same bonus as the attack that dropped the previous opponent. The character can use this ability once per round.
