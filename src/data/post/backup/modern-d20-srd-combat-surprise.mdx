## Surprise

When a combat starts, if a character was not aware of his or her enemies and they were aware of the character, that character is surprised. Likewise, a character can surprise his or her enemies if the character knows about them before theyÂ’re aware of the character.

### The Surprise Round

If some but not all of the combatants are aware of their opponents, a surprise round happens before regular rounds begin. The combatants who are aware of the opponents can act in the surprise round, so they roll for [initiative](modern-d20-srd-combat-initiative). In [initiative](modern-d20-srd-combat-initiative) order (highest to lowest), combatants who started the battle aware of their opponents each take an [attack
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) or move action during the surprise round (see [Action
Types](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types)). If no one or everyone is surprised, a surprise round does not occur.

### Unaware Combatants

Combatants who are unaware at the start of battle do not get to act in the surprise round. Unaware combatants are still flat-footed because they have not acted yet. Because of this, they lose any [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) bonus to [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense).
