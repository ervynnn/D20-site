     Using FX Items




     To use a magic item or psionic item, it must be activated. The three ways to activate FX items are described below.




     Command Word: If no activation method is suggested either in the item description or by the nature of the item, assume that a command word is needed to activate it. Command word activation means that a character speaks the word and the item activates. No other special knowledge is needed.




     The
     [
      Knowledge
     ](modern-d20-srd-skills-knowledge)
     (arcane lore) skill might be useful in identifying secret command words or deciphering clues regarding them. A successful

      check
     ](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index)
     (DC 30) is needed to come up with the word itself. If that

     ](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index)
     is failed, succeeding at a second
     [
      check
     ](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index)
     (DC 25) might provide some insight or clue to discovering the command word or phrase.




     Activating a command word FX item is an

and does not provoke

.

     FX Completion: This is the activation method for

     . To use an FX completion item safely, a character must be high enough level in the right class to cast the spell already.




     Activating an FX completion item is an

and provokes attacks of

.

     Use Activated: This type of item is activated simply by use.  Use activation is generally straightforward and self-explanatory.




     Many use-activated items are objects that a character wears. Continually functioning items are practically always items that one wears. A few must simply be in the characters possession. However, some items made for wearing must still be activated. Although this activation sometimes requires a command word (see above), usually it means mentally willing the activation to happen. The description of an item states whether a command word is needed.




     Unless stated otherwise, activating a use-activated FX item is either an
     [
      attack

action
](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions)
or a
[
free action
](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types)
and does not provoke
[
attacks
of opportunity
](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity)
, unless the use involves committing an action that provokes an
[
attack
of opportunity
](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity)
in itself. If the use of the item takes time before an effect occurs, then use activation is an
[
attack
action
](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions)
. If the items activation is subsumed in use and takes no extra time, use activation is a
[
free
action
](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types)
.

     Use activation doesnt mean that if a character uses an item, he or she automatically knows what it can do.  A character must know (or at least guess) what the item can do and then use the item to activate it, unless the benefit of the item comes automatically.
