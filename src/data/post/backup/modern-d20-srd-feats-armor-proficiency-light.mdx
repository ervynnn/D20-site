## Armor Proficiency (Light)

Benefit: When a character wears a type of armor with which he or she is proficient, the character gets to add the armors equipment bonus to his or her [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense). Also, the [armor
check penalty](modern-d20-srd-equipment-armor-general) applies only to [Balance](modern-d20-srd-skills-balance), [Climb](modern-d20-srd-skills-climb), [Escape
Artist](modern-d20-srd-skills-escape-artist), [Hide](modern-d20-srd-skills-hide), [Jump](modern-d20-srd-skills-jump), [Move
Silently](modern-d20-srd-skills-move-silently), and [Tumble](modern-d20-srd-skills-tumble) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

Normal: A character who wears armor with which he or she is not proficient adds only the armors nonproficient equipment bonus to his or her [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense). Also, he or she suffers its [armor
check penalty](modern-d20-srd-equipment-armor-general) on [attack
rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) and on all [skill
checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) that involve moving.
