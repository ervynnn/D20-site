## Action Types

The four types of actions are [attack
actions](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types-php#attack-action-index), [move actions](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types-php#move-action-index), [full-round
actions](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types-php#full-round-action-index), and [free actions](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types-php#free-action-index). In a normal round, a character can perform an attack action and a move action (or two move actions; a character can always take a move action in place of an attack action), or a character can perform a full-round action. A character can also perform as many free actions as the GM allows.

In some situations (such as in the surprise round) a character may be limited to taking only a single attack or move action.

### Attack Action

An attack action allows a character to do something. A character can make an [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll), use a [skill](modern-d20-srd-skills-index) or a [feat](modern-d20-srd-feats-index) (unless the [skill](modern-d20-srd-skills-index) or [feat](modern-d20-srd-feats-index) requires a full-round action to perform; see below), or perform other similar actions. During a combat round, a character can take an attack action and a move action. A character can take a move action before or after performing an attack action.

### Move Action

A move action allows a character to move his or her speed or perform an action that takes a similar amount of time. A character can move his or her speed, climb one-quarter of his or her speed, draw or stow a weapon or other object, stand up, pick up an object, or perform some equivalent action (see [Table:
Actions in Combat](modern-d20-srd-combat-actions-in-combat)).

A character can take a move action in the place of an attack action.

If a character moves no actual distance in a round, that character can take one 5-foot step before, during, or after the action.

### Full-Round Action

A full-round action consumes all a characters effort during a round. The only movement the character can take during a full-round action is a 5-foot step before, during, or after the action. Some full-round actions do not allow a character to take a 5-foot step. A character can also per­form free actions (see below) as the GM allows.

### Free Action

Free actions consume a very small amount of time and effort, and over the span of the round, their impact is so minor that they are considered free. A character can perform one or more free actions while taking another action normally. However, the GM puts reasonable limits on what a character can really do for free. For instance, dropping an object, dropping to a prone position, speaking a sentence or two, and ceasing to concentrate on a magic spell (if magic is available in the campaign) are all free actions.
