## Skip Shot

Prerequisites: [Point
Blank Shot](modern-d20-srd-feats-point-blank-shot), [Precise Shot](modern-d20-srd-feats-precise-shot).

Benefit: If the character has a solid, relatively smooth surface on which to skip a bullet (such as a street or a concrete wall), and a target within 10 feet of that surface, the character may ignore cover between the character and the target. However, the character receives a 2 penalty on his or her [attack
roll](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll), and the characters attack deals 1 die of [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage).

Special: The surface doesnt have to be perfectly smooth and level; a brick wall or an asphalt road can be used. The target can have no more than nine-tenths [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover) for A character to attempt a skip shot.
