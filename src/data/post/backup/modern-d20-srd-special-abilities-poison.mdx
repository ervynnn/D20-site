## Poison (Ex)

Poison attacks deal initial [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage),
such as [temporary
ability damage](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-ability-score-reduction) or some other effect, to the opponent
on a failed [Fortitude save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws). Unless otherwise noted, another [saving
throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) is required 1 minute later (regardless of the first [save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)s
result) to avoid secondary damage.

The [Fortitude save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) against poison has a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 poisoning creatures HD + poisoning creatures [Constitution
modifier](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) (the exact DC is given in the creatures Species Traits). A successful [save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) negates the damage.
