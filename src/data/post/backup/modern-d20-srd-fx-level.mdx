## Level

The relative power of a spell is indicated by its level. A spells level also indicates whether a particular spellcaster is capable of preparing and casting the spell.

Spell Slots: Every spellcaster can prepare as many spells every day as he or she has spell slots. (See the [advance
class](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-index) description for details.)

Spell slots have levels just as spells do; a spell slot of a certain level is designed to hold a spell of that level. Its possible, however, to place a lower-level spell in a higher-level spell slot if you desire. A character doesnt have to fill all spell slots with prepared spells every day (although it usually makes sense to do so).
