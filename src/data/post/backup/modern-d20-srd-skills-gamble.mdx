## Gamble (Wis)

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): To join or start a game, a character must first pay a stake. The character sets the purchase DC of the stake if he or she starts the game, or the GM sets it if the character joins a game. Stakes run from penny-ante (purchase DC 4) to astronomical (purchase DC 24). A character cannot [take
20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index) when purchasing a stake.

If the stake is within the characters means (it is equal to or less than his or her [Wealth
bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus)), the character stands no chance of winning any significant amount. The character might come out ahead, but the amount is not enough to affect his or her [Wealth
bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus). Since paying the stake didnt cost any points of [Wealth
bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus), the character doesnt lose anything either.

If the stake is higher than the characters [Wealth
bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus) (before applying any reductions from purchasing the stake), the character gets a +1 bonus on his or her Gamble [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) for every point the purchase DC is above the characters [Wealth
bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus).

The characters Gamble [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) is opposed by the Gamble [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) of all other participants in the game. (If playing at a casino, assume the house has a Gamble skill modifier equal to the stake purchase DC. Regardless of the stake purchase DC, the house does not get a bonus on its Gamble [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) for the purchase DC.) If there are many characters participating, the GM can opt to make a single roll for all of them, using the highest Gamble skill modifier among them and adding a +2 bonus to the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

If the character beats all other participants, he or she wins and gains an increase to his or her [Wealth
bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus). The amount of the increase depends on the difference between the characters [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) result and the next highest result among the other participants.

| Check Result Difference | Wealth Bonus Increase |
| :---------------------- | --------------------: |
| 19                      |                    +1 |
| 1019                    |                    +2 |
| 2029                    |                    +3 |
| 30-39                   |                    +4 |
| 40 or more              |                    +5 |

Try Again?: No, unless the character wants to put up another stake.

Special: A character cant [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) or [take 20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index) when making a Gamble [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

A character with the [Confident](modern-d20-srd-feats-confident) feat gets a +2 bonus on all Gamble [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

Time: A Gamble [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) requires 1 hour.
