## Escape Artist (Dex) Armor Penalty

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): Make a [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) to escape from restraints or to squeeze through a tight space.

| Restraint                                 |                                                       DC |
| :---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------: |
| Ropes                                     |                                  Opponents Dex check +20 |
| Net                                       |                                                       20 |
| Handcuffs                                 |                                                       35 |
| Tight space                               |                                                       30 |
| [Grappler](modern-d20-srd-combat-grapple) | Opponents [grapple check](modern-d20-srd-combat-grapple) |

For ropes, a characters Escape Artist [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) is opposed by the [Dexterity
check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics) result of the opponent who tied the bonds. Since its easier to tie someone up than to escape from being tied up, the opponent gets a +20 bonus on his or her [Dexterity
check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics).

For a tight space, a [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) is only called for if the characters head fits but his or her shoulders dont. If the space is long, such as in an airshaft, the GM may call for multiple [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). A character cant fit through a space that his or her head doesnt fit through.

A character can make an Escape Artist [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) opposed by his or her opponents [grapple
check](modern-d20-srd-combat-grapple) to get out of a [grapple](modern-d20-srd-combat-grapple) or out of a pinned condition (so that the character is just being [grappled](modern-d20-srd-combat-grapple)). Doing so is an [attack
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions), so if the character escapes the [grapple](modern-d20-srd-combat-grapple) he or she can move in the same round.

Try Again?: A character can make another [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) after a failed [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) if the character is squeezing through a tight space, making multiple [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). If the situation permits, the character can make additional [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) as long as he or she is not being actively opposed.

Special: A character can [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) on an Escape Artist [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). A character can [take
20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index) if he or she is not being actively opposed (a character can [take
20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index) if he or she is tied up, even though its an opposed [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), because the opponent isnt actively opposing the character).

A character with the [Nimble](modern-d20-srd-feats-nimble) feat gets a +2 bonus on all Escape Artist [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

Time: Making a [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) to escape from being bound by ropes, handcuffs, or other restraints (except a [grappler](modern-d20-srd-combat-grapple)) requires 1 minute. Escaping a net is a [full-round
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions). Squeezing through a tight space takes at least 1 minute, maybe longer, depending on the distance that must be crossed.
