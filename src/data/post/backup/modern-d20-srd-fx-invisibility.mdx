## Invisibility

Illusion

[Level](modern-d20-srd-fx-level): [Mage](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-mage) 2; [Components](modern-d20-srd-fx-components): V, S, M; [Casting Time](modern-d20-srd-fx-casting-time); [Attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) [Range](modern-d20-srd-fx-range): Personal or touch; [Target](modern-d20-srd-fx-target): You or a creature or object weighing no more than 100 lb./level; [Duration](modern-d20-srd-fx-duration): 1 minute/level (D); [Saving Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): Will negates (harmless) or Will negates (harmless, object); [Spell Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance): Yes (harmless) or Yes (harmless, object)

The creature or object touched vanishes from sight, even from darkvision. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, the gear vanishes, too. If the caster casts the spell on someone else, neither the caster nor his or her allies can see the subject, unless they can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so.

Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so. Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible.

The subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable. The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible characters perceptions.) Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Note that spells that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.

An invisible creature gains a +40 bonus on [Hide](modern-d20-srd-skills-hide) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) if immobile, or a +20 bonus on [Hide](modern-d20-srd-skills-hide) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) if moving. Pinpointing the location of an invisible character who isnt attempting to hide requires a [Spot](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot-php#skill-check-index) against DC 40 if immobile or DC 20 if moving.
