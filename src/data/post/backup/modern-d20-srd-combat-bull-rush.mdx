## Bull Rush

A character can attempt a bull rush as an [attack
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) made during his or her move action, or as part of a charge. (In general, a character cant make an [attack
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) during a [move
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions); this is an exception.) In either case, the character doesnt get a 5-foot step before, during, or after the bull rush attempt. When the character bull rushes, he or she attempts to push an opponent straight back instead of attacking the opponent. A character can only bull rush an opponent who is one size category larger than the character, the same size, or smaller.

### Initiating a Bull Rush

First, the character moves into the targets square. Moving in this way provokes an [attack
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity) from each foe that threatens the character, probably including the target.

Second, the character and the target make opposed [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) checks. If the character and the target are different sizes, the larger combatant gets a bonus on the [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) check of +4 per difference in size category. The character gets a +2 bonus if he or she was charging. The target gets a +4 stability bonus if he or she has more than two legs or is otherwise exceptionally stable.

### Bull Rush Results

If the character beats the targets [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) check, the character pushes the opponent back 5 feet. The character can push the target back an additional 5 feet for every 5 points by which the character exceeded the targets check result, provided the character moves with the target. A character cant, however, exceed his or her normal movement for that action. (The target provokes attacks of opportunity if moved. So does the character, if he or she moves with the target. The target and the character do not provoke attacks of opportunity from each other as a result of this movement.)

If the character fails to beat the targets [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) check, the character moves 5 feet straight back to where the character was before the character moved into the opponents square. If that square is occupied, the character falls prone in the square.
