## Drive-By Attack

Benefit: The character takes no vehicle speed penalty when making an [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) while in a moving vehicle. Also, if the character is the driver, he or she can take his or her [attack
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) to make an [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) at any point along the vehicles movement.

Normal: When attacking from a moving vehicle, a character takes a penalty based on the [vehicles speed](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed). Passengers can [ready
an action](modern-d20-srd-combat-special-initiative-actions) to make an [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) when their vehicle reaches a particular location, but the driver must make his or her [attack
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) either before or after the vehicles movement.
