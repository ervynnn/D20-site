## Enhance Ability

Transmutation

[Level](modern-d20-srd-fx-level): [Acolyte](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-acolyte) 2, [Mage](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-mage) 2; [Components](modern-d20-srd-fx-components): V, S, M/DF; [Casting Time](modern-d20-srd-fx-casting-time); [Attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) [Range](modern-d20-srd-fx-range): Touch; [Target](modern-d20-srd-fx-target): Creature touched; [Duration](modern-d20-srd-fx-duration): 1 minute/level; [Saving Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): Will negates (harmless); [Spell Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance): Yes (harmless)

The spell grants a temporary +5 enhancement bonus to one [ability
score](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma) chosen by the caster at the time of casting.

A temporary increase to Intelligence or Wisdom does not allow arcane or divine casters to gain extra spells, but the save DCs for their spells increase. A temporary increase in Intelligence doesnÂ’t grant extra skill points.
