## Combat Martial Arts

Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +1.

Benefit: With an unarmed strike, the character deals lethal or nonlethal [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) (the characters choice) equal to 1d4 + the characters [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier. The characters unarmed attacks count as armed, which means that opponents do not get [attacks
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity) when the character attacks them unarmed. The character may make [attacks
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity) against opponents who provoke such attacks.

Normal: Without this feat, a character deals only 1d3 points of nonlethal [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage). Unarmed attacks normally provoke [attacks
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity), and unarmed combatants cannot normally make [attacks
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity).
