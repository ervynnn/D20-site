    Falling




    A character takes 1d6 points of
    [
     damage
    ](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
    for every 10 feet of a fall, to a maximum of 20d6 points. If the character succeeds on a Reflex
    [
     saving

throw
](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
(DC 10, +1 for each 10 feet fallen), this damage is halved. If the
[
saving
throw
](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
fails, full
[
damage
](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
is applied.

    A character can make a

DC required by the fall.
