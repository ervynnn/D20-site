## Resist Energy

Abjuration

[Level](modern-d20-srd-fx-level): [Acolyte](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-acolyte) 2, [Mage](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-mage) 2; [Components](modern-d20-srd-fx-components): V, S, DF; [Casting Time](modern-d20-srd-fx-casting-time); [Attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) [Range](modern-d20-srd-fx-range): Touch; [Target](modern-d20-srd-fx-target): Creature touched; [Duration](modern-d20-srd-fx-duration): 10 minutes/level; [Saving Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): Fortitude negates (harmless); [Spell Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance): Yes (harmless)

This abjuration grants a creature limited protection to [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) from whichever one of five energy types the caster selects: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic/concussion. The creature gains [energy
resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-resistance-to-energy) 10 against the energy type chosen, meaning that each time the creature is subjected to such [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) (whether from a natural or magical source), that [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) is reduced by 10 points before being applied to the creatures [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points). The value of the energy resistance granted increases by 5 points for every three caster levels above 3rd. The spell protects the recipients equipment as well.

Resist energy absorbs only [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage). The character could still suffer unfortunate side effects.
