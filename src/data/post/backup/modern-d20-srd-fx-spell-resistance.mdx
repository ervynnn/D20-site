     Spell Resistance




     Spell resistance is a special defensive ability that protects against spells.




     Each spell description includes an entry that indicates whether spell resistance applies to the spell (if so, Yes; if not, No). In general, whether spell resistance applies depends on what the spell does:




     Targeted Spell: If the spell is targeted at a creature, spell resistance applies. If the spell targets multiple specific creatures, spell resistance applies to those individuals that have it.




     Area Spell: If the target is within the area of a spell, its spell resistance applies. The spell resistance protects the resistant creature without affecting the spell itself.




     Effect Spell: Most effect spells summon or create something and are not subject to spell resistance. Effect spells that affect a creature more or less directly are sometimes subject to spell resistance.




     Level Check: If a spell is being resisted by a creature with spell resistance, the caster must make a level check (1d20 + caster level) and get a result at least equal to the creatures spell resistance for the spell to affect that creature. If the caster fails the check, the spell doesnt affect the defender. The defenders spell resistance is like a Defense score against magical attacks.




     (Harmless) and (Object): These terms mean the same thing in a spell resistance entry as they do for saving throws. A creature with spell resistance must voluntarily drop the resistance in order to receive the effects of a spell noted as harmless without the level check described above. Doing so is an attack action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Once a creature lowers its resistance, it remains down until the creatures next turn, at the beginning of which it automatically returns. A creatures spell resistance never interferes with its own spells, powers, items, or abilities.




     Only spells and spell-like abilities are subject to spell resistance. Extraordinary and supernatural abilities (including enhancement bonuses on magic weapons) are not. A creature can have some abilities that are subject to spell resistance and others that are not.




     Spell resistance does not stack with power resistance, and vice versa.
