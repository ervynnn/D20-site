## Attack Roll

An attack roll represents a characters attempts to strike an opponent on the characters turn in a round. When a character makes an attack roll, he or she rolls 1d20 and adds his or her [attack
bonus](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-bonus). If the result equals or beats the targets [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense), the character hits and deals [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage). Many modifiers can affect the attack roll.

A natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on the attack roll is always a miss. A natural 20 (the d20 comes up 20) is always a hit. A natural 20 is also always a threata possible [critical
hit](modern-d20-srd-combat-critical-hits).

If the character is not proficient in the weapon he or she is attacking with (the character doesnt have the appropriate Weapon Proficiency feat), that character takes a 4 penalty on the attack roll.
