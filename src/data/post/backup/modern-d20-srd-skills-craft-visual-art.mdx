## Craft (Visual Art) (Int)

This skill allows a character to create paintings or drawings, take photographs, use a video camera, or in some other way create a work of visual art.

When attempting to create a work of visual art, the character simply makes a Craft (visual art) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), the result of which determines the quality of the work.

Unless the effort is particularly elaborate or the character must acquire an expensive piece of equipment, the basic components have a [purchase
DC](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check) of 5.

| Skill Check Result |    Effort Achieved |
| :----------------- | -----------------: |
| 9 or lower         | Untalented amateur |
| 1019               |   Talented amateur |
| 2024               |       Professional |
| 2530               |             Expert |
| 31 or higher       |             Master |

Creating a work of visual art requires at least a [full-round
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions), but usually takes an hour, a day, or more, depending on the scope of the project.

Special: A character with the [Creative](modern-d20-srd-feats-creative) feat gets a +2 bonus on all Craft (visual art) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).
