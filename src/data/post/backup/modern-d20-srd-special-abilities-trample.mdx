## Trample (Ex)

As an [attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) during its turn each round, the creature can run over an opponent at least one size category smaller than itself, entering the opponents fighting space to do so. The trample deals bludgeoning [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage), and the creatures descriptive text lists the amount.

Trampled opponents can attempt [attacks
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity), but these incur a 4 penalty. If they do not make [attacks
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity), trampled opponents can attempt [Reflex
saves](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) for half damage. The save DC equals 10 + 1/2 trampling creatures HD + trampling creatures [Strength
modifier](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) (the exact DC is given in the creatures descriptive text).
