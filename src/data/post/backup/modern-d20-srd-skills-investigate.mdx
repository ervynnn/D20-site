## Investigate (Int) Trained Only

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): A character generally uses [Search](modern-d20-srd-skills-search) to discover clues and Investigate to analyze them. If the character has access to a crime lab, the character uses the Investigate skill to collect and prepare samples for the lab. The result of the Investigate [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) provides bonuses or penalties to the lab workers.

Analyze Clue: The character can make an Investigate [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) to apply forensics knowledge to a clue. This function of the Investigate skill does not give the character clues where none existed before. It simply allows the character to extract extra information from a clue he or she has found.

The base DC to analyze a clue is 15. It is modified by the time that has elapsed since the clue was left, and whether or not the scene was disturbed.

| Circumstances                            | DC Modifier |
| :--------------------------------------- | ----------: |
| Every day since event (max modifier +10) |          +2 |
| Scene is outdoors                        |          +5 |
| Scene slightly disturbed                 |          +2 |
| Scene moderately disturbed               |          +4 |
| Scene extremely disturbed                |          +6 |

Collect Evidence: The character can collect and prepare evidentiary material for a lab. This use of the Investigate skill requires an [evidence
kit](modern-d20-srd-equipment-professional-equipment).

To collect a piece of evidence, make an Investigate [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 15). If the character succeeds, the evidence is usable by a crime lab. If the character fails, a crime lab analysis can be done, but the lab takes a 5 penalty on any necessary [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). If the character fails by 5 or more, the lab analysis simply cannot be done. On the other hand, if the character succeeds by 10 or more, the lab gains a +2 circumstance bonus on its [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) to analyze the material.

This function of the Investigate skill does not provide the character with evidentiary items. It simply allows the character to collect items he or she has found in a manner that best aids in their analysis later, at a crime lab.

Try Again?: Generally, analyzing a clue again doesnt add new insight unless another clue is introduced. Evidence collected cannot be recollected, unless there is more of it to take.

Special: A character can [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) when making an Investigate check, but cannot [take
20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index).

Collecting evidence requires an [evidence
kit](modern-d20-srd-equipment-professional-equipment). If the character does not have the appropriate kit, the character takes a 4 penalty on his or her [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

A character with the [Attentive](modern-d20-srd-feats-attentive) feat and at least 1 rank in this skill gets a +2 bonus on all Investigate [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

Time: Analyzing a clue is a [full-round
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions). Collecting evidence generally takes 1d4 minutes per object.
