The weapons covered in this section fall under the [Exotic
Firearms Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-exotic-firearms-proficiency) feat. Someone who wields a heavy weapon without the appropriate proficiency takes a 4 penalty on all [attack
rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) with the weapon.

### M2HB

This heavy-duty .50-caliber machine gun has been in service since World War II, and remains a very common vehicle-mounted military weapon around the world. The [Exotic
Firearms Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-exotic-firearms-proficiency) (heavy machine guns) feat applies to this weapon.

### M72A3 LAW

The LAW (light antitank weapon) is a disposable, one-shot rocket launcher. It comes as a short, telescoped fiberglass and aluminum tube. Before using the weapon, the firer must first arm and extend the tube, which is a move action.

When the LAW hits its target, it explodes like a grenade or other explosive, dealing its 10d6 points of [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) to all creatures within a 10-foot radius ([Reflex
save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) DC 18 for half damage). Because its explosive features a shaped charge designed to penetrate the armor of military vehicles, the LAW ignores up to 10 points of hardness if it strikes a vehicle, building, or object. However, this only applies to the target struck, not to other objects within the burst radius.

The M72 has a minimum range of 30 feet. If fired against a target closer than 30 feet away, it does not arm and will not explode.

The [Exotic Firearms
Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-exotic-firearms-proficiency) (rocket launchers) feat applies to this weapon.

### M79

This simple weapon is a single-shot grenade launcher. It fires 40mm grenades
(see under [Grenades
and Explosives](modern-d20-srd-equipment-weapons-explosives)). These grenades look like huge bullets
an inch and a half across; they cant be used as hand grenades, and the M79 cant shoot hand grenades.

Attacking with an M79 is identical to throwing an explosive: you make a ranged [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) against a specific 5-foot square (instead of targeting a person or creature). The differences between using the M79 and throwing an explosive lie in the range of the weapon (which far exceeds the distance a hand grenade can be thrown) and the fact that the M79 requires a weapon proficiency to operate without penalty.

The [Exotic Firearms
Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-exotic-firearms-proficiency) (grenade launchers) feat applies to this weapon.
