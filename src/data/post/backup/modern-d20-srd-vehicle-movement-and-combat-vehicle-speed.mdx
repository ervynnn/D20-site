## Vehicle Speed

[Vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) speed is expressed in five categories: stationary, alley speed, street speed, highway speed, and all-out. Each of these speed categories represents a range of possible movement (see Table: Vehicle Speeds and Modifiers). Each round, a [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) moves according to its current speed category.
