## Unbalance Opponent

Prerequisites: [Defensive
Martial Arts](modern-d20-srd-feats-defensive-martial-arts), base attack bonus +6.

Benefit: During the characters action, the character designates an opponent
no more than one size category larger or smaller than the character. That opponent
doesnt get to add his or her [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier
to [attack
rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) when targeting the character. (If the opponent has a [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) penalty,
he or she still takes that penalty.)

The opponents [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier applies to [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage), as usual.

The character can select a new opponent on any action.
