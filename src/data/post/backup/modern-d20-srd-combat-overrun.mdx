## Overrun

A character can attempt an overrun as an [attack
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) made during his or her [move
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions), or as part of a charge. (In general, a character cannot make an [attack
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) during a [move
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions); this is an exception.) In either case, the character doesnt get a 5-foot step before, during, or after the overrun attempt. With an overrun, the character attempts to move through an opponents area, going past or over the opponent. A character can only overrun an opponent who is one size category larger than the character, the same size, or smaller. A character can make only one overrun attempt per action.

First, the character must move at least 10 feet in a straight line into the targets square (provoking [attacks
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity) normally).

Then the target chooses either to avoid the character or to block the character. If the opponent avoids the character, the character keeps moving. (A character can always move through a square occupied by someone who lets the character by.) If the opponent blocks the character, make a [trip](modern-d20-srd-combat-trip) attack against the opponent (see [Trip](modern-d20-srd-combat-trip)). If the character succeeds in [tripping](modern-d20-srd-combat-trip) his or her opponent, the character can continue his or her movement as normal.

If the character fails and are tripped in turn, the character falls prone in the targets square. If the character fails but are not [tripped](modern-d20-srd-combat-trip), the character has to move 5 feet back the way he or she came, ending his or her movement there. If that square is occupied, the character falls prone in the square.
