    An immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere surrounds the caster and excludes all spell effects of 3rd level and lower. The area or effect of any such spells does not include the area of the minor globe of invulnerability. Such spells fail to affect any target located within the globe. This includes spell-like abilities and spells or spell-like effects from objects. However, any type of spell can be cast through or out of the magical globe. Spells of 4th level and higher are not affected by the globe. The globe can be brought down by a targeted

. The caster can leave and return to the globe without penalty.

    Note that spell effects are not disrupted unless their effects enter the globe, and even then they are merely suppressed, not dispelled.




    If a given spell has more than one level depending on which character class is casting it, use the level appropriate to the caster to determine whether minor globe of invulnerability stops it.
