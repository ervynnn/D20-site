### Class Features

All of the following features pertain to the Battle Mind advanced class.

### Psionic Skills

A Battle Mind has access to the following psionic skills. These skills are considered class skills for the Battle Mind, and she can use her skill points to buy ranks in them, just like other skills in the game.

### Autohypnosis (Wis):

Trained only. You have trained your mind to resist certain injuries and threats while also gaining a few select benefits.

| Task            |         DC |
| :-------------- | ---------: |
| Resist fear     |         15 |
| Memorize        |         15 |
| Tolerate poison | Poisons DC |
| Willpower       |         20 |

Check: The DC and effect depend on the task you attempt.

Resist Fear: In response to a fear effect, you can make an Autohypnosis check on your next action even if youve been overcome by fear. A successful check grants you another [saving throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) with a +4 morale bonus to resist the fear effect.

Memorize: You can attempt to memorize a long string of numbers, a long passage of verse, or other particularly difficult piece of information. Each successful check allows you to memorize up to 250 words or the equivalent of what could be comfortably contained on an 8 1/2-by-11-inch sheet of paper. You always retain this information; however, you can only recall it with a successful Autohypnosis check.

Tolerate Poison: In response to being poisoned, you can make an Autohypnosis check on your next action. A successful check grants you a +4 morale bonus on your [saving throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) to resist the poisons secondary damage.

Willpower: If reduced to 0 hit points (disabled), you may make an Autohypnosis check. If successful, you can perform a strenuous action without taking 1 point of damage. A failed check carries no penaltiesyou can choose not to perform the strenuous action. If you do perform the strenuous action after failing the check, you take 1 point of damage, as normal.

Try Again?: For resist fear and memorize, you can make a check once per round. You cant try again to tolerate poison. You cant try again in the same round for willpower.

Special: You can take 10 on Autohypnosis checks, but you cant take 20.

Most uses of Autohypnosis are attack actions. Willpower is a free action that can be attempted once per round.

Concentration [(Con)](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores): The normal Concentration skill expands to include psionic applications, as defined below.

Check: You must make a Concentration check whenever you may potentially be distracted while engaged in an activity, including manifesting a power or concentrating on an active power, that requires your full attention.

If the check succeeds, you may continue with the action as normal. If the check fails, the action automatically fails and is wasted. If you were in the process of manifesting a power, the power is lost. If you were concentrating on an active power, the power ends. The table in the Concentration skill description summarizes the various types of distractions. In situations where the distraction occurs while you are manifesting a power, you add the level of the power to the DC.

Try Again?: You can try again, but doing so doesnt cancel the effects of a previous failure. If you lost a power, the power is lost.

Special: By making a check (DC 15 + power level), you can use Concentration to manifest a power defensively, thus avoiding attacks of opportunity. If the check succeeds, you can attempt the action without incurring any attacks of opportunity.

### Psionic Powers

The Battle Minds main strength is her ability to manifest offensive [psionic
powers](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index).

A [psionic power](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index) is a one-time psionic effect. [Psionic
powers](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index) require power points to use. Unlike arcane spellcasters, Battle Minds dont have spellbooks and they dont prepare powers ahead of time. In addition, a Battle Mind can use psionics while wearing armor without risking the failure of the power.

A Battle Minds level limits the number of power points available for manifesting powers. In addition, a Battle Mind must have a key ability score equal to at least 10 + the powers level to manifest a particular power.

The Battle Minds selection of powers is extremely limited and tied to combat. At 1st level, a Battle Mind knows two 0-level powers of your choice. At each level, the Battle Mind discovers one or more previously latent powers, as indicated on the table below.

The DC for [saving throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)s to resist a psionic power is 10 + the powers level + the Battle Minds key ability modifier.

A Battle Mind can manifest a certain number of powers per day based on her available power points. She just pays the power point cost of a power to manifest it, no preparation necessary. The number of power points available per day is shown above.

### Psi-Blade

At 2nd level, a Battle Mind can manifest a glowing blade of mental energy. This 1-foot-long blade extends from the Battle Minds fist. It can be manifested as a move action, and it lasts for a number of rounds equal to the Battle Minds level or until the Battle Mind wills it to dissipate. She can create another one on her next move action, as long as the Battle Minds power point reserve is 1 or more.

The psi-blade deals 1d6 points of piercing [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage). At 3rd level, her psi-blade gains a +1 enhancement bonus. At 5th level the enhancement bonus improves to +2. At 7th level, it improves to +3, and at 9th level it improves to +4.

The Battle Mind can apply the [Weapon
Focus](modern-d20-srd-feats-weapon-focus) or [Weapon Finesse](modern-d20-srd-feats-weapon-finesse) feats to her psi-blade.

### Imprint Tattoo

Starting at 2nd level, a Battle Mind can create create tattoos on his body or someone elses that can be used to invoke psionic powers. A tattoo is a single-use item that duplicates the effect of a particular power. Imprinting a tattoo takes one day. The purchase DC for the raw materials to imprint a tattoo is 15 + the tattoos power level + the tattoos manifester level.

The Battle Mind must also spend experience points to imprint a tattoo. The XP cost is equal to the power level x the manifester level x the purchase DC of the raw materials.

Finally, the Battle Mind makes a [Craft
(visual arts)](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft-visual-art) check. The DC for the check is 10 + the power level + the manifester level of the power. If the check fails, the raw materials are used up but the XP are not spent. The Battle Mind can try imprinting the tattoo again as soon as he purchases more raw materials.

### Bonus Feats

At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Battle Mind gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Battle Mind must meet all the prerequisites of the feat to select it.

[Archaic Weapons
Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-archaic-weapons-proficiency), [Athletic](modern-d20-srd-feats-athletic), [Blind-Fight](modern-d20-srd-feats-blind-fight), [Cleave](modern-d20-srd-feats-cleave), [Combat
Martial Arts](modern-d20-srd-feats-combat-martial-arts), [Combat
Reflexes](modern-d20-srd-feats-combat-reflexes), [Exotic
Melee Weapon Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-exotic-melee-weapons-proficiency), [Focused](modern-d20-srd-feats-focused), [Improved
Combat Martial Arts](modern-d20-srd-feats-improved-combat-martial-arts), [Power
Attack](modern-d20-srd-feats-power-attack), [Weapon Finesse](modern-d20-srd-feats-weapon-finesse), [Weapon
Focus](modern-d20-srd-feats-weapon-focus).

### Psychic Shield

At 4th level, a Battle Mind can manifest a shield of psychic energy, outlining her body in a barely perceptible glowing nimbus that provides a +3 equipment bonus to [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense). The shield can be manifested as a [move
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions), and it lasts for a number of rounds equal to the Battle Minds level or until she wills it to dissipate. She can create another shield on her next [move
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions), as long as her power point reserve is 1 or more.

### Combat Manifestation

At 5th level, a Battle Mind becomes adept at manifesting [psionic
powers](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index) in combat. She gets a +4 bonus on [Concentration](modern-d20-srd-skills-concentration) checks to manifest a power while on the defensive.

### Improved Psi-Blade

At 7th level, a Battle Minds psi-blade increases in damage capability. It now deals 1d8 points of piercing [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) on a successful attack.

### Improved Psychic Shield

At 8th level, a Battle Minds psychic shield improves. It now provides a +6 equipment bonus to [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense).

### Ultimate Psi-Blade

At 10th level, a Battle Minds psi-blade increases further in damage capability. It now deals 2d6 points of piercing [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) on a successful [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll).
