## Facing and Firing Arcs

Unlike with characters, when dealing with [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles), the [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) facing (the direction its pointing) is important. Facing indicates the direction in which the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) is traveling (assuming its not moving in reverse). It can also determine which weapons aboard the vehicle can be brought to bear on a target.

A [weapon](modern-d20-srd-equipment-military-vehicles) built into a vehicle can by mounted to fire in one of four directionsforward, aft (rear), right, or leftor be built into a partial or full turret. A partial turret lets a [weapon](modern-d20-srd-equipment-military-vehicles) fire into three adjacent fire arcs (such as forward, left, and right), while a full turret lets it fire in any direction. For [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) with [weapons](modern-d20-srd-equipment-military-vehicles), a weapons arc of fire is given in the [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) description.
