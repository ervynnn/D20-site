## Animate Dead

Necromancy [Evil]

[Level](modern-d20-srd-fx-level): [Acolyte](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-acolyte) 3, [Mage](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-mage) 4; [Components](modern-d20-srd-fx-components): V, S, M; [Casting Time](modern-d20-srd-fx-casting-time): [Attack
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions); [Range](modern-d20-srd-fx-range): Touch; [Targets](modern-d20-srd-fx-target): One or more corpses touched; [Duration](modern-d20-srd-fx-duration): Instantaneous; [Saving
Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): None; [Spell
Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance): No

This spell turns the bones or bodies of dead creatures into [undead](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-undead) skeletons or zombies that follow the casters spoken commands. The skeletons or zombies can follow the caster, or can remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific type of creature) entering the place. The [undead](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-undead) remain animated until they are destroyed. (A destroyed skeleton or zombie cant be animated again.)

Regardless of the type of [undead](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-undead), a caster cant create more HD of undead than twice his or her caster level with a single casting of animate dead.

The [undead](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-undead) created remain under casters control indefinitely. No matter how many times the caster uses this spell, however, he or she can control only 4 HD worth of [undead](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-undead) creatures per caster level. If the caster exceeds this number, all the newly created creatures fall under his or her control, and any excess [undead](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-undead) from previous castings become uncontrolled (the caster chooses which creatures are released). Any [undead](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-undead) the character commands (if the character has the ability to [command
or rebuke undead](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-acolyte)) do not count toward the limit.

[Skeletons](modern-d20-srd-creatures-skeleton-template): A skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact corpse or [skeleton](modern-d20-srd-creatures-skeleton-template); the corpse must have bones. If a [skeleton](modern-d20-srd-creatures-skeleton-template) is made from a corpse, the flesh falls off the bones. The statistics for a [skeleton](modern-d20-srd-creatures-skeleton-template) depend on its size; they do not depend on what abilities the creature may have had while alive.

[Zombies](modern-d20-srd-creatures-zombie-template): A [zombie](modern-d20-srd-creatures-zombie-template) can be created only from a mostly intact corpse; the creature must have a true anatomy. The statistics for a [zombie](modern-d20-srd-creatures-zombie-template) depend on its size, not on what abilities the creature may have had while alive.
Material Component: Purchase DC 15 + 1 per 2 HD of the undead.
