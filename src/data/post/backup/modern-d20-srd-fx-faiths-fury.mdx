     The caster draws upon holy (or unholy) power to smite enemies with one of the following allegiances, as chosen by the caster: chaos, evil, good, or law. The spell deals 1d8 points of
     [
      damage
     ](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
     per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to creatures with the designated

     and blinds them for 1 round. A successful Fortitude
