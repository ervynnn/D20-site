## Basic Character Classes

### Basic Class Descriptions

### Ability

This entry tells which ability is typically associated with that class.

### Hit Die

The die type used by characters of the class to determine the number of hit points gained per level.

A player rolls one die of the given type each time his or her character gains a new level. The characters [Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier is applied to the roll. Add the result to the characters hit point total. Even if the result is 0 or lower, the character always gains at least 1 hit point. A 1st-level character gets the maximum hit points rather than rolling (although the [Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier is still applied).

### Action Points

The number of [action points](modern-d20-srd-basics-action-points) gained per level.

### Class Skills

This section of a class description provides a list of class skills and also gives the number of skill points the character starts with at 1st level and the number of skill points gained each level thereafter. A characters [Intelligence](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier is applied to determine the total skill points gained each level (but always at least 1 point per level, even for a character with an [Intelligence](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) penalty).

A 1st-level character starts with 4 times the number of skill points he or she receives upon attaining each level beyond 1st. The maximum ranks a character can have in a class skill is the characters level +3.

A character can also buy skills from other classes skill lists. Each skill point buys a half rank in these cross-class skills, and a character can only buy up to half the maximum ranks of a class skill.

### Starting Feats

The feats gained at 1st level in the class.

### Class Table

Fort Save: The base save bonus for Fortitude [saving

Ref Save: The base save bonus for Reflex [saving

Will Save: The base save bonus for Will [saving
throws](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws). The characters [Wisdom](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier also applies.

Class Features: Level-dependent class features, each explained in the section that follows.

### Class Features

This entry details special characteristics of the class, including bonus feats and unique talents, that are gained as a character attains higher levels in the class.

### Talents

Every basic class offers a selection of talents to choose from. A character gains a talent upon attaining each odd-numbered level in a class (including 1st level). Talents are considered to be extraordinary abilities. Some talents have prerequisites that must be met before a character can select them.

### Bonus Feats

Every basic class offers a selection of bonus feats to choose from. A character gains a bonus feat upon attaining each even-numbered level in a class. These bonus feats are in addition to the feats that all characters receive as they attain new levels. Some feats have prerequisites that must be met before a character can select them.
