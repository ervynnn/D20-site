Most of these weapons deal damage by means of a blade or a sharp point. Some of them are moderately expensive, reflecting their archaic nature in modern-day society.

### Bayonet (Fixed)

The statistics given describe a bayonet fixed at the end of a longarm with an appropriate mount. With the bayonet fixed, the longarm becomes a double weaponclublike at one end and spearlike at the other. A character can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if the character does so, he or she incurs all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, as if using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon.

### Hatchet

This light axe is a chopping tool that deals slashing damage when employed
as a weapon.

### Longsword

This classic, straight blade is the weapon of knighthood and valor.

### Machete

This long-bladed tool looks much like a short, lightweight sword.

### Rapier

The rapier is a lightweight sword with a thin blade. A character can select the [Weapon
Finesse](modern-d20-srd-feats-weapon-finesse) feat to apply his or her [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier instead of [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier to attack rolls with a rapier.

### Spear

This primitive device is a reach weapon. A character can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but cant use it against an adjacent foe.

### Straight Razor

Favored by old-school organized crime mechanics, this item can still be found in some barbershops and shaving kits.

### Sword Cane

This is a lightweight, concealed sword that hides its blade in the shaft of a walking stick or umbrella. Because of this special construction, a sword cane is always considered to be concealed; it is noticed only with a [Spot](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 18). (The walking stick or umbrella is not concealed, only the blade within.)
