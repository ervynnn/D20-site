## Heroic Surge

Benefit: The character may take an extra [move
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions) or [attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) in a round, either before or after the characters regular actions. The character may use Heroic Surge a number of times per day depending on his or her character level (as shown below), but never more than once per round.

| Character Level | Times per Day |
| :-------------- | ------------: |
| 1st4th          |             1 |
| 5th8th          |             2 |
| 9th12th         |             3 |
| 13th16th        |             4 |
