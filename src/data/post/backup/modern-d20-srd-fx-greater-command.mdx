     The caster gives the subjects a single command, which they obey to the best of their ability at their earliest opportunity. The caster may select from the following options.




     Approach: On the subjects turn, the subjects move toward the caster as quickly and directly as possible for the duration. The subjects may do nothing but move during their turn, and they incur

      attacks

of opportunity
](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity)
for this movement as normal.

     Drop: On the subjects turn, they drop whatever they are holding.




     Fall: The subject immediately falls to the ground and remains
     [
      prone
     ](modern-d20-srd-combat-favorable-unfavorable-conditions)
     for the duration. They may act normally while
     [

     ](modern-d20-srd-combat-favorable-unfavorable-conditions)
     , but take any appropriate penalties.




     Flee: On the subjects turn, they move away from the caster as quickly as possible for the duration. The subjects may do nothing but move during their turn.




     Halt: The subjects stand in place for the duration. The subjects may not take any actions, but may defend themselves normally.




     If a subject cant carry out the casters command on his or her next turn, the spell automatically fails for that subject.




     At the start of each commanded creatures action after the first, it gets another

to attempt to break free from the spell.
