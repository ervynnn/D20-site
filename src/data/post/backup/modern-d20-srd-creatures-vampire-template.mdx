## Vampire (Template)

Vampires speak, read, and write the languages they knew in life.

### Template Traits

Vampire is an acquired template that can be added to any [humanoid](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-humanoid), or monstrous [humanoid](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-humanoid) (referred to hereafter as the base creature). The creatures type changes to [undead](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-undead). It uses all the base creatures statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature +2.

Undead: Vampires have the traits and immunities common to [undead](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-undead).

Hit Dice: Change to d12. Vampires have no [Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) score.

Speed: Same as the base creature. If the base creature has a swim speed, the vampire retains the ability to swim and is not vulnerable to immersion in running water (see below).

Defense: The base creatures natural armor improves by +6.

Attacks: A vampire retains all the attacks of the base creature and gains a slam attack if it didnt already have one. The vampires slam attack deals [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) according to its size: Fine 1, Diminutive 1d2, Tiny 1d3, Small 1d4, Medium-size 1d6, Large 1d8, Huge 2d6, Gargantuan 2d8, Colossal 4d6.

Special Qualities: A vampire retains all the special qualities of the base creature and gains the additional special qualities described below.

Blood Drain (Ex): A vampire can suck blood from a living victim with its fangs by making a successful [grapple](modern-d20-srd-combat-grapple) check. If it pins the foe, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of temporary [Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) damage each round the pin is maintained.

Create Spawn (Su): A [humanoid](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-humanoid) or monstrous [humanoid](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-humanoid) slain by a vampires [energy drain](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-energy-drain) attack rises as a vampire loyal to its creator (called the master vampire, or simply master). The new vampire gains three [allegiances](modern-d20-srd-basics-allegiances) (in any order): chaos, evil, and master. All previous allegiances are lost permanently. A vampire loses its [allegiance](modern-d20-srd-basics-allegiances) to its master (and may adopt a new [allegiance](modern-d20-srd-basics-allegiances) to replace it) only when the master vampire is destroyed.

Domination (Su): As an [attack
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions), a vampire can crush an opponents will just by gazing into his or her eyes. The vampire can attempt to dominate only one target at a time, and the target must be within 30 feet and able to see the vampire. A target that fails a [Will
save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) (DC 10 + 1/2 vampires Hit Dice + vampires [Charisma](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier) becomes the vampires thrall for 1 day per Hit Die of the vampire. The thrall temporarily loses all previous [allegiances](modern-d20-srd-basics-allegiances) and adopts a singular, unswerving [allegiance](modern-d20-srd-basics-allegiances) to the vampire. If the vampire commands its thrall to do something blatantly self-destructive, the target can make a [Will
save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) to break the vampires control. If the save succeeds, the target becomes free-willed and regains its previous [allegiances](modern-d20-srd-basics-allegiances).

[Energy Drain](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-energy-drain) (Su): A living creature hit by a vampires
slam attack gains two negative levels. See [energy drain](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-energy-drain).
A creature killed by a vampires [energy drain](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-energy-drain) attack rises as a vampire under its creators control (see Create Spawn, above).

Alternate Form (Su): A vampire can assume the form of a [bat](modern-d20-srd-creatures-bat), [rat](modern-d20-srd-creatures-rat), or [wolf](modern-d20-srd-creatures-wolf) as a [move
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions). The vampire can remain in that form until it assumes another form or until the next sunrise.

Children of the Night (Su): Vampires command the lesser creatures of the world and, once per day, can call forth a pack of 4d8 [rats](modern-d20-srd-creatures-rat), a swarm of 10d10 [bats](modern-d20-srd-creatures-bat), or a pack of 3d6 [wolves](modern-d20-srd-creatures-wolf) as a [full-round
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions). These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve the vampire for up to 1 hour.

[Damage Reduction](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-damage-reduction) 15/+1 (Su): In campaigns without magic weapons, the GM can disregard the vampires [damage reduction](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-damage-reduction), change it to 15/silver or 15/wood, or apply the [damage reduction](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-damage-reduction) only to certain types of weapons (ballistic, bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, or sonic/concussion).

[Fast Healing](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-fast-healing) 5 (Ex): A vampire heals 5 points of [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) each round so long as it has at least 1 [hit
point](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points). If reduced to 0 [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points) or lower, a vampire automatically assumes gaseous form (see below) and attempts to escape. It must reach its coffin home within 2 hours or be destroyed. (It can travel up to nine miles in 2 hours.) Once at rest in its coffin, its [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points) rise to 1 [hit point](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points) after 1 hour; the vampire then resumes healing at the rate of 5 [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points) per round.

Gaseous Form (Su): As a [move
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions), the vampire (and all its gear) becomes insubstantial, misty, and translucent. The vampire gains [damage reduction](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-damage-reduction) 20/+1 in this form. Its armor (including natural armor) ceases to modify its [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense), though other modifiers (such as from [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) and size) still apply. The vampire cannot attack or use supernatural abilities while in gaseous form.

A vampire in this form can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability. It can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks. Its gaseous form is subject to wind and cannot enter water or other liquid.

[Cold
Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-resistance-to-energy) 20 (Ex): A vampire ignores the first 20 points of cold damage from any cold-based attack.

[Electricity
Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-resistance-to-energy) 20 (Ex): A vampire ignores the first 20 points of electricity damage from any electricity-based attack.

[Spider Climb](modern-d20-srd-fx-spider-climb) (Ex): A vampire can climb sheer surfaces as though with a [spider
climb](modern-d20-srd-fx-spider-climb) spell.

[Turn Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-turn-resistance) (Ex): A vampire has +4 [turn resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-turn-resistance) .

[Darkvision](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-darkvision) (Ex): Vampires have [darkvision](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-darkvision) with a range of 60 feet.

Weaknesses (Ex): A vampire has several weaknesses, described below. A vampire can have fewer weaknesses, but each lost weakness costs a vampire one of its other special qualities. For example, a vampire that is immune to the effects of garlic might be unable to summon children of the night.

Direct Sunlight: The merest sliver of sunlight deals 2d6 points of [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) to a vampire. A vampire exposed to direct sunlight for 1 full round must succeed on a [Fortitude
save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) (DC 20) or be consumed by fire and destroyed utterly.

Garlic: A vampire cannot enter or pass through any 5-foot square containing garlic. A vampire takes a 2 penalty on [melee](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) attack rolls against a target wearing garlic.

Holy Symbol: A vampire takes a 2 penalty on [melee](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) attack rolls against a creature prominently wearing or brandishing a holy symbol. The symbols touch deals 1d4 points of holy [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) to a vampire, and a vampire reduced to 0 hit points in this fashion is destroyed utterly. This holy [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) can be healed only by inflict spells.

Inviolate Sanctuary: A vampire cannot enter a privately owned residence unless invited in by the rightful owner or tenant.

Mirror: A vampire in view of a mirror cannot use its domination special quality (see above).

Running Water: A vampire cannot cross running water (but may be carried across). A vampire immersed in running water loses one-third of its remaining [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points) each round until it is destroyed at the end of the third round.

Wooden Stake: Wooden weapons that deal piercing damage (such as wooden stakes, arrows, pool cues, spear shafts, and table legs) threaten a [critical
hit](modern-d20-srd-combat-critical-hits) against a vampire on a natural 20 (unless noted otherwise), even though vampires are normally immune to [critical
hits](modern-d20-srd-combat-critical-hits). A successful [critical
hit](modern-d20-srd-combat-critical-hits) destroys a vampire instantly, turning it to dust.

[Allegiances](modern-d20-srd-basics-allegiances): Previous [allegiances](modern-d20-srd-basics-allegiances) are lost, replaced by allegiances to chaos, evil, and master (or simply chaos and evil if the master vampire has been destroyed). Changed [allegiances](modern-d20-srd-basics-allegiances) might cause the loss of particular class abilities.

Ability Scores: Vampires gain the following ability score increases: Str +6, [Dex](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) +4, [Int](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) +2, [Wis](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) +2, [Cha](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) +4. As [undead](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-undead) creatures, vampires have no [Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) score.

[Skills](modern-d20-srd-skills-index): Same as the base creature (human vampires retain the extra skill points afforded to all humans). Vampires receive a +8 species bonus on Bluff, [Hide](modern-d20-srd-skills-hide), [Listen](modern-d20-srd-skills-listen), [Move
Silently](modern-d20-srd-skills-move-silently), [Search](modern-d20-srd-skills-search), [Sense
Motive](modern-d20-srd-skills-sense-motive), and [Spot](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot) checks.

[Feats](modern-d20-srd-feats-index): Vampires gain the bonus feats [Alertness](modern-d20-srd-feats-alertness), [Combat Reflexes](modern-d20-srd-feats-combat-reflexes), [Dodge](modern-d20-srd-feats-dodge), [Improved Initiative](modern-d20-srd-feats-improved-initiative), and [Lightning
Reflexes](modern-d20-srd-feats-lightning-reflexes), assuming the base creature meets the prerequisites and doesnt already have these feats. Human vampires keep the extra feat they gained as a 1st-level human character.

Advancement: By character class.
