     Wondrous Items




     Wondrous items include anything that doesnt fall into the other groups, including jewelry, tools, books, clothing, and gadgets.




     Unless noted otherwise, activating a wondrous item takes an
     [
      attack

action
](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions)
and does not provoke
[
attacks
of opportunity
](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity)
. Wondrous items are activated by command word or use-activated.

     Purchase DC: A wondrous items purchase DC is 25 + the items caster level + its FX modifier. The FX modifier depends on the items nature, as shown on the table below:

| Items Nature    | FX Modifier |
| :-------------- | ----------: |
| Single-use item |             |

| Continuous effect or bonus

        1 | +3 |

| Limited number of uses per day | +2 |
| Limited number of charges | +1 |
| 1

       See Limit on FX Items Worn. A continuous effect item that does not take up one of these limited spaces has a +4 FX modifier (instead of +3). |  |
