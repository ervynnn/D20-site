The caster releases a bolt of electrical energy that deals 1d6 points of [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) per caster level (maximum 10d6) to each creature within its area. The bolt begins at the caster. The lightning bolt sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its path. It can melt metals with a low melting point. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the bolt may continue beyond the barrier if the spellÂ’s range permits; otherwise, it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.
