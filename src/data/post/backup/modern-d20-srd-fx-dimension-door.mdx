The caster instantly transfers him or herself from his or her current location to any other spot within range. The caster always arrives at exactly the spot desiredwhether by simply visualizing the area or by stating direction. After using this spell, the caster cant take any other actions until his or her next turn.

If the caster arrives in a place that is already occupied by a solid body, he or she is transported to a random open space on a suitable surface within 100 feet of the intended location. If there is no free space within 100 feet, the caster appears in a free space within 1,000 feet. If theres no free space within 1,000 feet, the spell fails and the caster remains where he or she is.
