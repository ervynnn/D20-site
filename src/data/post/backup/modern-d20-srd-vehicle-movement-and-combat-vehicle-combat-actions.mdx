    Vehicle Combat Actions




    Actions during
    [
     vehicle
    ](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
    combat are handled the same way as
    [
     actions
    ](modern-d20-srd-combat-actions-in-combat)
    during personal
    [
     combat
    ](modern-d20-srd-combat-combat-cycle)
    . In general, a character can take two
    [
     move

actions
](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions)
, one
[
move action
](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions)
and one
[
attack
action
](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions)
, or one
[
full-round
action
](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions)
in a round.
[
Free
actions
](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types)
can be performed normally, in conjunction with another
[
action
](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types)
.

[
Free Actions
](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types)
: Communicating orders is a
[
free
action
](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types)
. Characters can perform as many
[
free
actions
](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types)
as the GM permits in a single round.

[
Move Actions
](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions)
: Changing position within a
[
vehicle
](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
is usually a
[
move
action
](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions)
, especially if the character has to trade places with another character. If the characters
[
movement
](modern-d20-srd-combat-movement-and-position)
is short and unobstructed, the character can do it as the equivalent of a 5-foot step. Otherwise, it requires a
[
move
action
](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions)
.

[
Attack Actions
](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions)
: Anyone aboard a
[
vehicle
](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
can make an
[
attack
](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll)
with a
[
personal
weapon
](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-weapons)
, and drivers and gunners can make
[
attacks
](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll)
with any
[
vehicle-mounted
weapons
](modern-d20-srd-equipment-military-vehicles)
controlled from their positions.

[
Full-Round Actions:
](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions)
Since the driver must use a
[
move
action
](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions)
to control the vehicle, he or she cant take a
[
full-round
action
](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions)
unless he or she starts it in one round and completes it on his
or her next turn.
