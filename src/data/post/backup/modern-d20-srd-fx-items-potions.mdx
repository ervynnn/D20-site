## Potions

A potion is an elixir concocted with a [spell](modern-d20-srd-fx-index)-like or [psionic](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index) effect that affects only the drinker. A potion is a single-use item that can only duplicate [spells](modern-d20-srd-fx-index) or [psionic
powers](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index) of 3rd level or lower. A potion vial has a Defense of 12, hardness 1, 1 hit point, and a break DC of 12. A vial holds 1 ounce of liquid.

Drinking a potion takes an [attack
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) and provokes [attacks
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity).

Purchase DC: A potions purchase DC is 17 + the potions caster level + spell level unless noted otherwise.
