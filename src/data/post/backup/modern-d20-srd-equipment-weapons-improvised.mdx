## Improvised Weapons

Any portable object can be used as a weapon in a pinch. In most cases, an object can be wielded either as a melee weapon or a ranged weapon.
A character takes a 4 penalty on his or her [attack
roll](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) when wielding or throwing an improvised weapon. An improvised weapon is not considered simple, archaic, or exotic, so weapon proficiency [feats](modern-d20-srd-feats-index) cannot offset the 4 penalty.

A character can effectively wield or throw an object of his or her size category or smaller using one hand. A character can effectively wield or throw an object one size category larger than him or herself using two hands. An improvised thrown weapon has a range increment of 10 feet. Increase the range increment for creatures of Large size or larger as follows: Large 15 feet, Huge 30 feet, Gargantuan 60 feet, Colossal 120 feet.

Damage: Improvised weapons deal lethal [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) based on their size, although the GM may adjust the [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) of an object that is especially light or heavy for its size. The wielders [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier applies only to [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) from Tiny or larger improvised weapons; do not apply the wielders [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier to damage from Diminutive objects. Table: Improvised Weapon Damage by Size gives the damage for improvised weapons of varying size. Improvised weapons threaten a [critical
hit](modern-d20-srd-combat-critical-hits) on a natural roll of 20. Improvised weapons of Fine size deal no damage.

Unlike real weapons, improvised weapons are not designed to absorb damage. They tend to shatter, bend, crumple, or fall apart after a few blows. An improvised weapon has a 50% chance of breaking each time it deals damage or, in the case of thrown objects, strikes a surface (such as a wall) or an object larger than itself.
