## Moving

On his or her action, the driver moves the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) a number of squares that falls within the [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) [speed](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed) category.

Unlike characters, a [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) cannot [double
move](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions), [run](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions), or otherwise extend its movement (except by changing to a higher [speed
category](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-declaring-speed)).

Every [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) has a top speed, included in its statistics on [Table:
Vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles). A [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) cannot move more squares than its top speed. This means that some [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) cannot move at [all-out
speed](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-declaring-speed), or even [highway
speed](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-declaring-speed).

Count squares for [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) just as for characters. [Vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) can move diagonally; remember that when moving diagonally, every second square costs two squares worth of movement. Unlike with moving characters, a [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) facing is important; unless it changes direction, a [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) always moves in the direction of its facing (or in the opposite direction, if its moving in reverse).
