## Jump (Str) Armor Penalty

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): The DC and the distance the character can cover vary according to the type of jump the character is attempting.

The characters Jump [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) is modified by his or her speed. The DCs specified below assume a speed of 30 feet (the speed of a typical human). If the characters speed is less than 30 feet, he or she takes a penalty of 6 for every 10 feet of speed less than 30. If the characters speed is greater than 30 feet, he or she gains a bonus of +4 for every 10 feet over 30.

If the character has ranks in the Jump skill and succeeds on a [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), the character lands on his or her feet (when appropriate) and can move as far as the characters remaining movement allows. If the character attempts a Jump [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) untrained, the character lands prone unless he or she beats the DC by 5 or more. Standing from a prone position is a move action.

Distance moved by jumping is counted against maximum movement in a round. A character can start a jump at the end of one turn and complete the jump at the beginning of your next turn.

Long Jump: This is a horizontal jump, made across a gap such as a chasm or stream. At the midpoint of the jump, the character attains a vertical height equal to one-quarter the horizontal distance. The DC for the jump is equal to the distance jumped (in feet). The DCs for long jumps of 5 to 30 feet are given in the table below. A character cannot jump a distance greater than his or her normal speed.

All Jump DCs covered here assume that the character can move at least 20 feet in a straight line before attempting the jump. If this is not the case, the DC for the jump is doubled.

| Long Jump Distance                                                | DC1 | Long Jump Distance | DC1 |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :-: | :----------------: | --: |
| 5 feet                                                            |  5  |      20 feet       |  20 |
| 10 feet                                                           | 10  |      25 feet       |  25 |
| 15 feet                                                           | 15  |      30 feet       |  30 |
| 1 Requires a 20-foot move. Without a 20-foot move, double the DC. |     |                    |     |

If the character fails the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) by less than 5, he or she doesnt clear the distance, but can make a [Reflex
save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) (DC 15) to grab the far edge of the gap. The character ends his or her movement grasping the far edge. If that leaves the character dangling over a chasm or gap, getting up requires a [move
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions) and a [Climb](modern-d20-srd-skills-climb) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 15).

High Jump: This is a vertical leap, made to jump up to grasp something overhead, such as a tree limb or ledge. The DC for the jump is the height x4 (in feet). The DCs for high jumps of 1 to 8 feet are given in the table below.

All Jump DCs covered here assume that the character can move at least 20 feet in a straight line before attempting the jump. If this is not the case, the DC for the jump is doubled.

| High Jump Distance                                                 | DC1 | High Jump Distance | DC1 |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :-: | :----------------: | --: |
| 1 foot                                                             |  4  |       5 feet       |  20 |
| 2 feet                                                             |  8  |       6 feet       |  24 |
| 3 feet                                                             | 12  |       7 feet       |  28 |
| 4 feet                                                             | 16  |       8 feet       |  32 |
| 1 Requires a 20-foot move. Without a running start, double the DC. |     |                    |     |

If the character succeeds on the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), he or she can reach the height. The character grasps the object he or she was trying to reach. If the character wishes to pull him or herself up, the character can do so with a [move
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions) and a [Climb](modern-d20-srd-skills-climb) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 15). If the character fails the Jump [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), he or she does not reach the height, and lands on his or her feet in the same square from which the character jumped.

The difficulty of reaching a given height varies according to the size of the character or creature.

Generally, the maximum height a creature can reach without jumping is given in the table below. (As a Medium-size creature, a typical human can reach 8 feet without jumping.) If the creature is long instead of tall, treat it as one size category smaller.

| Creature Size | Maximum Height |
| :------------ | -------------: |
| Colossal      |        128 ft. |
| Gargantuan    |         64 ft. |
| Huge          |         32 ft. |
| Large         |         16 ft. |
| Medium-size   |          8 ft. |
| Small         |          4 ft. |
| Tiny          |          2 ft. |
| Diminutive    |          1 ft. |
| Fine          |        0.5 ft. |

Hop Up: The character can jump up onto an object as tall as his or her waist with a Jump [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 10). Doing so counts as 10 feet of [movement](modern-d20-srd-combat-movement-and-position). The character does not need to get a running start to hop up (the DC is not doubled if you do not get a running start).

Jumping Down: If the character intentionally jumps from a height, he or she takes less damage than if the character just falls. The DC to jump down from a height is 15. The character does not have to get a running start to jump down (the DC is not doubled if the character does not get a running start).

If the character succeeds on the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), he or she takes [falling](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-falling) damage as if the character had dropped 10 fewer feet than he or she actually did.

Special: Effects that increase a characters speed also increase the characters jumping distance, since the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) is modified by the characters speed.

A character can [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) when making a Jump [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). If there is no danger associated with failing, the character can [take
20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index).

A character with the [Acrobatic](modern-d20-srd-feats-acrobatic) feat gets a +2 bonus on all Jump [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). A character with the [Run](modern-d20-srd-feats-run) feat gains a +2 competence bonus on Jump [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) preceded by a 20-foot move.

[Tumble](modern-d20-srd-skills-tumble) can provide a +2 synergy bonus on Jump [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (see [Skill
Synergy](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-synergy-index)).

Time: Using the Jump skill is either a [move
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions) or a [full-round
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions), depending on whether the character starts and completes the jump during a single [move
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions) or a [full-round
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions).
