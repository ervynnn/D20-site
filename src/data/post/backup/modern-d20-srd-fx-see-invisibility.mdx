    The caster sees any objects or beings that are invisible as if they were normally visible.




    The spell does not reveal the method used to obtain invisibility. It does not reveal illusions or enable the caster to see through opaque objects. It does not reveal creatures who are simply hiding, concealed, or otherwise hard to see.
