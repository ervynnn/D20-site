## Concentration (Con)

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): A character makes a Concentration [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) whenever he or she may potentially be distracted while engaged in some action that requires his or her full attention (such as making a [Disable
Device](modern-d20-srd-skills-disable-device) or [Treat Injury](modern-d20-srd-skills-treat-injury) check). Situations such as taking [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage), working in a bouncing [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles), or dealing with severe weather can require a character to make a Concentration [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

If the Concentration [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) succeeds, the character may continue with the action. If the Concentration [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) fails, the action automatically fails (with the appropriate ramifications, if any), and the action is wasted.
A successful Concentration [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) still doesnt allow a character to [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) when in a stressful situation; he or she must roll the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) as normal.

The [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) DC depends on the nature of the distraction.

Try Again?: Yes, though a success doesnt cancel the effects of a previous failure, such as the disruption of an action that was being concentrated on.

Special: A character can use Concentration to avoid [attacks
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity) when attempting a skill check that normally provokes [attacks
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity). The DC to do so is 15.

If the Concentration [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) succeeds, the character may attempt the action normally without incurring any [attacks
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity). If the Concentration [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) fails, the related check automatically fails just as if the characters concentration had been disrupted by a distraction. The character does not provoke [attacks
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity), however.

This use of Concentration applies only to skill [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). It does not apply to other actions that normally provoke [attacks
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity), such as [movement](modern-d20-srd-combat-movement-and-position) or making unarmed attacks.

A character with the [Focused](modern-d20-srd-feats-focused) feat gets a +2 bonus on all Concentration [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

The concentration skill has further uses for characters using [magic](modern-d20-srd-fx-index) or [psionics](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index).

Time: Making a Concentration check doesnt require an action; it is either a
reaction (when attempted in response to a distraction) or part of another action
(when attempted actively).
