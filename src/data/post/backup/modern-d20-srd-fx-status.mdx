     Status allows a divine caster to mentally monitor the relative positions and general condition of his or her companions. The caster is aware of direction and distance to the creatures and their status: unharmed, wounded, disabled, staggered, unconscious, dying, dead, and so forth. Once the spell has been cast upon the subjects, the distance between them and the caster does not affect the spell.
