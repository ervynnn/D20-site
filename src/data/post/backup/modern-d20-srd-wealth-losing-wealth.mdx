## Losing Wealth

Any time a character purchases an object or service with a purchase DC higher than his or her current [Wealth
bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus), or one with a purchase DC of 15 or higher, the characters [Wealth
bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus) goes down. How much the [Wealth
bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus) is reduced depends on how expensive the object is.

| 16 or more points higher than current [Wealth
Bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus). | 2d6 points |
| 1 This stacks with the loss from a Purchase DC above the characters current [wealth
bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus). | |

Along with this loss, any time a character buys an [object](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-general) or [service](modern-d20-srd-equipment-services) with a purchase DC of 15 or higher, the character reduces his or her current [Wealth
bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus) by an additional 1 point.

A characters [Wealth bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus) only goes down if he or she successfully buys an [object](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-general) or [service](modern-d20-srd-equipment-services). If the character attempts to buy something and the check fails, his or her [Wealth
bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus) is unaffected.
