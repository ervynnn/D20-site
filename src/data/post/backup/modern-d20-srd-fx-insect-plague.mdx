     A horde of insects swarm in a thick cloud when this spell is cast. The insects limit vision to 10 feet, and spellcasting within the cloud is impossible. Creatures inside the insect plague, regardless of

     , sustain 1 point of damage at the end of each round they remain within, due to the bites and stings of the insects. Invisibility is no protection. All creatures with 2 or fewer HD are driven from the cloud at their fastest possible speed in a random direction and flee until they are at least 100 feet away from the insects. Creatures with 3 to 5 HD flee as well, though a

negates this effect. (This urge to flee is an extraÂ­ordinary fear effect.)

     Heavy smoke drives off insects within its bounds. Fire also drives insects away.  The insects return as soon as the fire is extinguished.  A single torch is ineffective against this vast horde of insects. Lightning, cold, and ice are likewise ineffective, while a strong wind (21+ mph) that covers the entire plague area disperses the insects and ends the spell.
