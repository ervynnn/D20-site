Survival gear helps characters keep themselves alive in the great outdoors.

### Backpack

This is a good-sized backpack, made of tough water-resistant material. It has one or two central sections, as well as several exterior pockets and straps for attaching tents, bedrolls, or other gear. It can carry up to 60 pounds of gear.

A backpack gives a character a +1 equipment bonus to [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) for the purpose of determining [carrying
capacity](modern-d20-srd-equipment-carrying-capacity).

### Binoculars

Binoculars are useful for watching opponents, wild game, and sporting events from a long distance.

Standard: Standard binoculars reduce the range penalty for [Spot](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) to 1 for every 50 feet (instead of 1 for every 10 feet). Using binoculars for [Spot](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) takes five times as long as making the check unaided.

Rangefinding: In addition to the benefit of standard binoculars, rangefinding binoculars include a digital readout that indicates the exact distance to the object on which they are focused.

Electro-Optical: Electro-optical binoculars function the same as standard binoculars in normal light. In darkness, however, users looking through them see as if they had the darkvision ability granted by night vision goggles.

### Chemical Light Stick

This disposable plastic stick, when activated, uses a chemical reaction to create light for 6 hours. It illuminates an area only 5 feet in radius. Once activated, it cant be turned off or reused. The listed purchase DC is for a pack of 5 sticks.

### Climbing Gear

All of the tools and equipment that climbing enthusiasts use to make climbing easier and, in some cases, possible, including ropes, pulleys, helmet and pads, gloves, spikes, chocks, ascenders, pitons, a handax, and a harness. It takes 10 minutes to remove the gear from its pack and outfit it for use. Use this gear with the [Climb](modern-d20-srd-skills-climb) skill.

### Compass

A compass relies on the Earths magnetic field to determine the direction of magnetic north. A compass grants its user a +2 equipment bonus on [Navigate](modern-d20-srd-skills-navigate) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

### Fire Extinguisher

This portable apparatus uses a chemical spray to extinguish small fires. The typical fire extinguisher ejects enough extinguishing chemicals to put out a fire in a 10-foot-by-10-foot area as a [move
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions). It contains enough material for two such uses.

### Flash Goggles

These eye coverings provide total protection against blinding light.

### Flashlight

Flashlights come in a wide variety of sizes and quality levels. Those covered here are professional, heavy-duty models, rugged enough to withstand the rigors of modern adventuring. Flashlights negate penalties for darkness within their illuminated areas.

Penlight: This small flashlight can be carried on a key ring. It projects a beam of light 10 feet long and 5 feet wide at its end.

Standard: This heavy metal flashlight projects a beam 30 feet long and 15 feet across at its end.

Battery Flood: Practically a handheld spotlight, this item projects a bright beam 100 feet long and 50 feet across at its end.

### Gas Mask

This apparatus covers the face and connects to a chemical air filter canister to protect the lungs and eyes from toxic gases. It provides total protection from eye and lung irritants. The filter canister lasts for 12 hours of use. Changing a filter is a move action. The purchase DC for one extra filter canister is 6.

### GPS Receiver

Global positioning system receivers use signals from GPS satellites to determine the receivers location to within a few dozen feet. A GPS receiver grants its user a +4 equipment bonus on [Navigate](modern-d20-srd-skills-navigate) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), but because the receiver must be able to pick up satellite signals, it only works outdoors.

### Map

While a compass or GPS receiver can help characters find their way through the wilderness, a map can tell a character where he or she is going and what to expect when he or she gets there.

Road Atlas: Road atlases are available for the entire United States, showing all major roads in each state. They can also be purchased for most major metropolitan areas, detailing every street in the entire region.

Tactical Map: A tactical map covers a small areausually a few miles on a sidein exacting detail. Generally, every building is represented, along with all roads, trails, and areas of vegetation.
