## Simple Maneuvers

During a [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) [movement](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-moving), the driver can perform any one of the following maneuvers.

45-Degree Turn: Any [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) can make a simple 45-degree turn as part of its [movement](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-moving). The [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) must move forward at least a number of squares equal to its turn number (shown on [Table:
Vehicle Speeds and Modifiers](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed)) before it can turn. Making a 45-degree turn costs 1 square of movement.

Ram: At [character
scale](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed), a driver does not have to perform a maneuver to [ram](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming) another [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)he or she only needs to drive his or her [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) into the other [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) square, and a [collision](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming) occurs (see [Collisions
and Ramming](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming)).

At chase scale, however, more than one [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) can occupy the same square and not [collide](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming)so [ramming](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming) another [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) requires a simple maneuver. The driver moves his or her [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) into the other [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) square and states that he or she is attempting to [ram](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming). Resolve the [ram](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming) as a [collision](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming), except that the driver of the target [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) can make a [Reflex
save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) (DC 15) to reduce the [damage](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-damaging-vehicles) to both [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) by half.

Sideslip: A driver might wish to move to the side without changing the [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) facing, for instance to change lanes. This simple maneuver, called a sideslip, allows a [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) to avoid obstacles or weave in and out of traffic without changing facing. A sideslip moves a [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) 1 square forward and 1 square to the right or left, and costs 3 squares of movement.
