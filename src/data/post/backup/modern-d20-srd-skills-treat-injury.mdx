## Treat Injury (Wis)

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): The DC and effect depend on the task attempted.

Long-Term Care (DC 15): With a [medical
kit](modern-d20-srd-equipment-professional-equipment), the successful application of this skill allows a patient to recover hit points and ability points lost to temporary damage at an advanced rate3 [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points) per character level or 3 [ability
points](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) restored per day of complete rest. A new [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) is made each day; on a failed [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), recovery occurs at the normal rate for that day of rest and care.

A character can tend up to as many patients as he or she has ranks in the skill. The patients need complete bed rest (doing nothing all day). The character needs to devote at least ½ hour of the day to each patient the character is caring for.

Restore Hit Points (DC 15): With a [medical
kit](modern-d20-srd-equipment-professional-equipment), if a character has lost [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points), the character can restore some of them. A successful [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), as a [full-round
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions), restores 1d4 hit points. The number restored can never exceed the characters full normal total of [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points). This application of the skill can be used successfully on a character only once per day.

Revive [Dazed](modern-d20-srd-conditions-index), [Stunned](modern-d20-srd-conditions-index), or [Unconscious](modern-d20-srd-conditions-index) Character (DC 15): With a [first
aid kit](modern-d20-srd-equipment-professional-equipment), the character can remove the [dazed](modern-d20-srd-conditions-index), [stunned](modern-d20-srd-conditions-index), or [unconscious](modern-d20-srd-conditions-index) condition from a character. This check is an [attack
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions).

A successful check removes the [dazed](modern-d20-srd-conditions-index), [stunned](modern-d20-srd-conditions-index), or [unconscious](modern-d20-srd-conditions-index) condition from an affected character. The character cant revive an unconscious character who is at 1 [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points) or lower without first stabilizing the character.

Stabilize Dying Character (DC 15): With a [medical
kit](modern-d20-srd-equipment-professional-equipment), a character can tend to a character who is dying. As an [attack
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions), a successful Treat Injury [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) stabilizes another character. The stabilized character regains no [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points), but he or she stops losing them. The character must have a [medical
kit](modern-d20-srd-equipment-professional-equipment) to stabilize a dying character.

Surgery (DC 20): With a [surgery
kit](modern-d20-srd-equipment-professional-equipment), a character can conduct field surgery. This application of the Treat Injury skill carries a 4 penalty, which can be negated with the [Surgery](modern-d20-srd-feats-surgery) feat. Surgery requires 1d4 hours; if the patient is at negative [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points), add an additional hour for every point below 0 the patient has fallen.

Surgery restores 1d6 [hit points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points) for every character level of the patient (up to the patients full normal total of [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points)) with a successful skill [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). Surgery can only be used successfully on a character once in a 24-hour period.
A character who undergoes surgery is fatigued for 24 hours, minus 2 hours for every point above the DC the surgeon achieves. The period of fatigue can never be reduced below 6 hours in this fashion.

Treat [Disease](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-disease) (DC 15): A character can tend to a character infected with a treatable [disease](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-disease). Every time the [diseased](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-disease) character makes a saving throw against [disease](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-disease) effects (after the initial contamination), the treating character first makes a Treat Injury [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) to help the [diseased](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-disease) character fend off secondary damage. This activity takes 10 minutes. If the treating characters [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) succeeds, the treating character provides a bonus on the diseased characters [saving
throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) equal to his or her ranks in this skill.

Treat [Poison](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-poison) (DC 15): A character can tend to a poisoned character. When a poisoned character makes a [saving
throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) against a [poisons](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-poison) secondary effect, the treating character first makes a Treat Injury [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) as an [attack
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions). If the treating characters [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) succeeds, the character provides a bonus on the poisoned characters [saving
throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) equal to his or her ranks in this skill.

Try Again?: Yes, for restoring [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points), reviving [dazed](modern-d20-srd-conditions-index), [stunned](modern-d20-srd-conditions-index), or [unconscious
characters](modern-d20-srd-conditions-index), stabilizing dying characters, and surgery. No, for all other uses of the skill.

Special: The [Surgery](modern-d20-srd-feats-surgery) feat gives a character the extra training he or she needs to use Treat Injury to help a wounded character by means of an operation.

A character can [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) when making a Treat Injury [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). A character can [take
20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index) only when restoring [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points) or attempting to revive [dazed](modern-d20-srd-conditions-index), [stunned](modern-d20-srd-conditions-index),
or [unconscious
characters](modern-d20-srd-conditions-index).

Long-term care, restoring [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points), treating [disease](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-disease), treating [poison](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-poison), or stabilizing a dying character requires a [medical
kit](modern-d20-srd-equipment-professional-equipment). Reviving a [dazed](modern-d20-srd-conditions-index), [stunned](modern-d20-srd-conditions-index),
or [unconscious
characters](modern-d20-srd-conditions-index) requires either a [first
aid kit](modern-d20-srd-equipment-professional-equipment) or a [medical
kit](modern-d20-srd-equipment-professional-equipment). Surgery requires a [surgery
kit](modern-d20-srd-equipment-professional-equipment). If the character does not have the appropriate kit, he or she takes a 4 penalty on the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

A character can use the Treat Injury skill on his or herself only to restore [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points), treat [disease](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-disease), or treat [poison](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-poison). The character takes a 5 penalty on your [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) any time he or she treats his or herself.

A character with the [Medical
Expert](modern-d20-srd-feats-medical-expert) feat gets a +2 bonus on all Treat Injury [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

Time: Treat Injury [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) take different amounts of time based on the task at hand, as described above.
