     The power does not enable the manifester to control the charmed person as if he or she was an automaton, but he or she does perceive the manifesters words and actions in the most favorable way. The manifester can try to give the subject orders, but the manifester must win an opposed

     check to convince the subject to do anything he or she would not ordinarily do. (The manifester cant try again.) A charmed person never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders. Any act by the manifester or his or her apparent allies that threatens the charmed person breaks the power. Note also that the manifester must speak the persons language to communicate his or her commands.
