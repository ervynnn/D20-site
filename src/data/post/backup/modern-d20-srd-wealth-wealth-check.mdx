## The Wealth Check

A Wealth check is a 1d20 roll plus a characters current [Wealth
bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus). The [Wealth bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus) is fluid. It [increases](modern-d20-srd-wealth-regaining-wealth) as a character gains Wealth
and [decreases](modern-d20-srd-wealth-losing-wealth) as the character makes purchases.

If the character succeeds on the Wealth check, the character gains the [object](modern-d20-srd-equipment-index). If the character fails, he or she cant afford the [object](modern-d20-srd-equipment-index) at the time.

If the characters current [Wealth
bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus) is equal to or greater than the DC, the character automatically succeeds.

If the character successfully purchases an [object](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-general) or [service](modern-d20-srd-equipment-services) with a purchase DC thats higher than his or her current [Wealth
bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus), the characters [Wealth
bonus decreases](modern-d20-srd-wealth-losing-wealth).
