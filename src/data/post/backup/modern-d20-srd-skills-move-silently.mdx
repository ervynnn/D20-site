## Move Silently (Dex) Armor Penalty

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): A characters Move Silently [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) is opposed by the [Listen](modern-d20-srd-skills-listen) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) of anyone who might hear the character. A character can move up to half his or her normal speed at no penalty. At more than half speed and up to the characters full speed, he or she takes a 5 penalty. Its practically impossible (20 penalty) to move silently while [attacking](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions), running, or charging.

Special: A character can [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) when making a Move Silently [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), but cant [take
20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index).

A character with the [Stealthy](modern-d20-srd-feats-stealthy) feat gets a +2 bonus on all Move Silently [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

Time: Move Silently is a [move
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions).
