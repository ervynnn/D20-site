## Forgery (Int)

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): Forgery requires materials appropriate to the document being forged, and some time. To forge a document the character needs to have seen a similar document before. The complexity of the document, the characters degree of familiarity with it, and whether the character needs to reproduce the signature or handwriting of a specific individual, provide modifiers to the Forgery [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), as shown below.

| Document Type                                |     |         |
| :------------------------------------------- | :-: | ------: |
|                                              |     |         |
| Simple (typed letter, business card)         | +0  | 10 min. |
| Moderate (letterhead, business form)         |  2  | 20 min. |
| Complex (stock certificate, drivers license) |  4  |   1 hr. |
| Difficult (passport)                         |  8  |   4 hr. |
| Extreme (military/law enforcement ID)        | 16  |  24 hr. |

| Familiarity                                      |     |
| :----------------------------------------------- | --: |
|                                                  |     |
| Unfamiliar (seen once for less than a minute)    |   4 |
| Fairly familiar (seen for several minutes)       |  +0 |
| Quite familiar (on hand, or studied at leisure)  |  +4 |
| Forger has produced other documents of same type |  +4 |
| Document includes specific signature             |   4 |

Some documents require security or authorization codes, whether authentic ones or additional forgeries. The GM makes the characters [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) secretly so the character is not sure how good his or her forgery is.

The Forgery skill is also used to detect someone elses forgery. The result of the original Forgery [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) that created the document is opposed by a Forgery [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) by the person who examines the document to [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) its authenticity. If the examiners [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) result is equal to or higher than the original Forgery [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), the document is determined to be fraudulent. The examiner gains bonuses or penalties on his or her [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) as given in the table below.

| Condition                                                                                                                                    | Examiners Check Modifier |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -----------------------: |
| Type of document unknown to examiner                                                                                                         |                        4 |
| Type of document somewhat known to examiner                                                                                                  |                        2 |
| Type of document well known to examiner                                                                                                      |                       +0 |
| Document is put through additional tests1                                                                                                    |                       +4 |
| Examiner only casually reviews the document1                                                                                                 |                        2 |
| 1Cumulative with any of the first three conditions on the table. Apply this modifier along with one of the other three whenever appropriate. |                          |

A document that contradicts procedure, orders, or previous knowledge, or one that requires the examiner to relinquish a possession or a piece of information, can increase the examiners suspicion (and thus create favorable circumstances for the examiners opposed Forgery check).

Try Again?: No, since the forger isnt sure of the quality of the original forgery.

Special: To forge documents and detect forgeries, one must be able to [read
and write](modern-d20-srd-skills-read-write-language) the language in question. (The skill is language-dependent.)

A character can [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) when making a Forgery check, but cant [take
20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index).

A character with the [Meticulous](modern-d20-srd-feats-meticulous) feat gets a +2 bonus on all Forgery [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

A character without a [forgery
kit](modern-d20-srd-equipment-professional-equipment) takes a 4 penalty on Forgery [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

Time: Forging a short, simple document takes about 1 minute. Longer or more complex documents take 1d4 minutes per page or longer.
