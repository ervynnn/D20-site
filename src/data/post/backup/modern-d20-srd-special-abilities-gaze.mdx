## Gaze (Su)

A gaze attack takes effect when opponents look at the creatures eyes. The attack can have almost any sort of effect: petrification, death, charm, and so on. The typical range is 30 feet, but check the creatures entry for details. The type of [saving
throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) for a gaze attack varies, but it is usually a [Will](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) or [Fortitude
save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws). The DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 gazing creatures HD + gazing creatures [Charisma
modifier](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) (the exact DC is given in the creatures Species Traits). A successful [saving
throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) negates the effect.

Each opponent within range of the gaze attack must attempt a [saving
throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) each round at the beginning of his or her turn. Opponents can avoid the [saving
throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) by averting their eyes or by using a barrier to sight.

Averting Ones Eyes: The opponent avoids looking at the creatures face and instead looks at its body, watching its shadow, tracking it in a reflective surface, or the like. Each round, the opponent has a 50% chance to not need to make a [saving
throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) against the gaze attack. The creature with the gaze attack, however, gains one-half [concealment](modern-d20-srd-combat-concealment) against that opponent.

Barrier to Sight: An opponent that cannot see the creature at all cannot be affected by its gaze attack. This can be accomplished by turning ones back on the creature, shutting ones eyes, or wearing a blindfold or head covering that prevents sight. The creature with the gaze attack gains total [concealment](modern-d20-srd-combat-concealment) against the opponent.

A creature with a gaze attack can actively gaze as an [attack
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) by choosing a target within range. That opponent must attempt a [saving
throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) but can try to avoid the gaze as described above. Thus, a target may need to [save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) against a creatures gaze twice during the same round: once before the targets action and once during the creatures turn.

A creature is immune to its own gaze attack unless otherwise noted.
