## Fast Healing (Ex)

The creature regains [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points) at an exceptionally fast rate, usually 1 or more [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points) per round. Fast healing stops working when a creature is reduced to 10 hp or fewer. Except as noted here, fast healing works just like [natural
healing](modern-d20-srd-combat-death-dying-healing).

Fast healing doesnt provide any benefit against attack forms that dont deal [hit
point](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points) [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage). Fast healing also doesnt restore [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points) lost to [starvation](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-starvation-thirst), [thirst](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-starvation-thirst), or [suffocation](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-suffocation-drowning), and it doesnt allow a creature to regrow or reattach severed body parts.
