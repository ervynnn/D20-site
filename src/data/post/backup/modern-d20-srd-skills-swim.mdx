## Swim (Str) Armor Penalty

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): A successful Swim [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) allows a character to swim one-quarter his or her speed as a [move
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions) or half the characters speed as a [full-round](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions) action. Roll once per round. If the character fails, he or she makes no progress through the water. If the character fails by 5 or more, he or she goes underwater.

If the character is underwater (from failing a swim [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) or because the character is swimming underwater intentionally), the character must hold his or her breath. A character can hold his or her breath for a number of rounds equal to the characters Constitution score, but only if the character does nothing but take [move
actions](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions) or [free actions](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types). If the character takes an [attack
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) or a [full-round
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions), the amount of breath the character has remaining is reduced by 1 round. (Effectively, a character in combat can hold his or her breath only half as long as normal.) After that period of time, the character must make a [Constitution
check](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) (DC 10) every round to continue holding his or her breath. Each round, the DC of the check increases by 1. If the character fails the check, the character begins to [drown](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-suffocation-drowning).

The DC for the Swim [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) depends on the water:

| Water        |  DC |
| :----------- | --: |
| Calm water   |  10 |
| Rough water  |  15 |
| Stormy water |  20 |

Each hour that the character swims, make a Swim [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) against DC 20. If the character fails, he or she becomes fatigued. If the character fails a [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) while fatigued, the character becomes exhausted. If the character fails a [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) while exhausted, the character becomes unconscious. Unconscious characters go underwater and immediately begin to [drown](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-suffocation-drowning).

Try Again?: A new [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) is allowed the round after a [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) is failed.

Special: A character takes a penalty of 1 for every 5 pounds of gear he or she carries, including [armor](modern-d20-srd-equipment-armor-general) and [weapons](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-weapons).

A character can [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) when making a Swim [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), but cant [take
20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index).

A character with the [Athletic](modern-d20-srd-feats-athletic) feat gets a +2 bonus on all Swim [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

Time: A Swim [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) is either a [move
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions) or a [full-round
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions), as described above.
