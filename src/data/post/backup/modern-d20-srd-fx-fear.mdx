## Fear

Necromancy [Fear, Mind-Affecting]

[Level](modern-d20-srd-fx-level): [Mage](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-mage) 4; [Components](modern-d20-srd-fx-components): V, S, M; [Casting Time](modern-d20-srd-fx-casting-time); [Attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) [Range](modern-d20-srd-fx-range): Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels); [Area](modern-d20-srd-fx-area): Cone; [Duration](modern-d20-srd-fx-duration): 1 round/level; [Saving Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): Will negates; [Spell Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance): Yes

An invisible cone of terror causes living creatures to become panicked. They suffer a 2 morale penalty on [saving
throws](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws), and they flee from the caster. A panicked creature has a 50% chance to drop what its holding, chooses its path randomly (as long as it is getting away from immediate danger), and flees any other dangers that confront it. If cornered, a panicked creature cowers. A cowering creature loses its [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) bonus, can take no actions, and takes a 2 penalty to its [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense).
