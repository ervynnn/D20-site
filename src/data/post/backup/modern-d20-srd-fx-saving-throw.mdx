     Saving Throw




     Most harmful spells allow an affected creature to make a
     [
      saving

throw
](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
to avoid some or all of the effect. The Saving Throw entry in a spell description defines which type of
[
saving
throw
](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
the spell allows and describes how saving throws against the spell work.

     Negates: This term means the spell has no effect on a creature that makes a successful
     [
      saving

throw
](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
.

     Partial: The spell causes an effect on its subject. A successful
     [
      saving

throw
](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
means that some lesser effect occurs.

     Half: The spell deals
     [
      damage
     ](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
     , and a successful
     [
      saving

throw
](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
halves the
[
damage
](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
taken (round down).

     None: No
     [
      saving throw
     ](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
     is allowed.




     Disbelief: A
     [
      saving throw
     ](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
     is not allowed purely on the basis of encountering the spell. Rather, the creature gets a
     [
      saving

throw
](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
only after interacting with or carefully studying the spell. A successful save lets the subject ignore the effect.

     (Object): The spell can be cast on objects, which receive
     [
      saving

throws
](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
only if they are magical in nature, or if they are attended (held, worn, or grasped) by a creature resisting the spell, in which case the object gets the creatures saving
[
throw
bonus
](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
unless its own bonus is greater. (This notation does not mean that a spell can only be cast on objects. Some spells of this sort can be cast on creatures or objects.)

     (Harmless): The spell is usually beneficial, not harmful, but a targeted creature can attempt a
     [
      saving

throw
](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
if it wishes.

[
Saving Throw
](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
Difficulty Class: A
[
saving
throw
](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
against a spell has a DC of 10 + the level of the spell + the spellcasters bonus for the relevant ability (see spellcasting advanced class for details).

     Succeeding at a
     [
      Saving Throw
     ](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
     : A creature that successfully saves against a spell without obvious physical effects feels a hostile force or a tingle, but cannot deduce the exact nature of the attack.  Likewise, if a creatures
     [
      saving

throw
](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
succeeds against a targeted spell the caster senses that the spell has failed. The caster does not sense when creatures succeed at saving throws against effect and area spells.

     Voluntarily Giving up a
     [
      Saving Throw
     ](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
     : A creature can voluntarily forego a
     [
      saving

throw
](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
and willingly accept a spells result. Even a character with a special
[
resistance
to magic
](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance)
can suppress this resistance if he or she wants to.

     Items Surviving after a
     [
      Saving Throw
     ](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
     : Unless the descriptive text for the spell specifies otherwise, all items carried and worn are assumed to survive a magical attack.




     If an item is not carried or worn and is not magical, it does not get a
     [
      saving

throw
](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
. It is simply dealt the appropriate
[
damage
](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
.
