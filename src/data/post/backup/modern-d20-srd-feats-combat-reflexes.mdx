## Combat Reflexes

Benefit: The maximum number of [attacks
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity) the character may make each round is equal to the characters [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier + 1. The character can still only make one [attack
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity) on a single opponent.

With this feat, the character may also make [attacks
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity) when flat-footed.

Normal: A character without the Combat Reflexes feat can make only one [attack
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity) per round and cant make [attacks
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity) when flat-footed.

Special: The Combat Reflexes feat doesnt allow a [Fast
hero](modern-d20-srd-classes-basic-fast-hero) with the opportunist talent to use that talent more than once per round.
