## Read/Write Language (None) Trained Only

The Read/Write Language skill doesnt work like a standard skill.

- A character automatically knows how to read and write his or her native language; the character does not need ranks to do so.
- Each additional language costs 1 rank. When a character adds a rank to Read/Write Language, he or she chooses a new language that the character can read and write.
- A character never makes Read/Write Language [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). A character either knows how to read and write a specific language or doesnt.
- To be able to speak a language that the character can read and write, he or she must take the [Speak
  Language](modern-d20-srd-skills-speak-language) skill for the appropriate language.
- A character can choose any language, modern or ancient. (See below for suggestions.) The GM might determine that a character cant learn a specific language due to the circumstances of the campaign.

Language Groups

There are thousands of languages to choose from when a character buys ranks in [Speak
Language](modern-d20-srd-skills-speak-language) or Read/Write Language. A few are listed here, sorted into their general language groups.

A languages group doesnt matter when a character is buying ranks in [Speak
Language](modern-d20-srd-skills-speak-language) or Read/Write Language. Language groups are provided because they pertain to the [Smart
heros](modern-d20-srd-classes-basic-smart-hero) Linguist talent.

This list is by no means exhaustivethere are many more language groups, and most groups contain more languages than those listed here.
