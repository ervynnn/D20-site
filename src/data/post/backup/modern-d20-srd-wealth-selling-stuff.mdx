     Selling Stuff




     To sell something, a character first needs to determine its sale value. Assuming the
     [
      object
     ](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-general)
     is undamaged and in working condition, the sale value is equal to the
     [
      objects
     ](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-general)
     purchase DC (as if purchased new) minus 3.




     Selling an
     [
      object
     ](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-general)
     can provide an increase to a characters

. The increase is the same amount as the

loss the character would experience if the character purchased an
[
object
](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-general)
with a purchase DC equal to the sale value.

     Regardless of the characters current

, he or she gains a
[
Wealth
bonus
](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus)
increase of 1 whenever the character sells an
[
object
](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-general)
with
a sale value of 15 or higher. If a character sells an object with a sale value
less than or equal to his or her current

](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus)
, and that sale value
is 14 or lower, the character gains nothing.

     A character cannot legally sell
     [
      restricted

objects
](modern-d20-srd-equipment-restricted-objects)
unless the character is licensed to own them. A character also cannot legally sell
[
objects
](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-general)
that have been reported as stolen. Selling
[
objects
](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-general)
illegally usually requires that the character have contacts in the black market, and reduces the sale value by an additional 3. Selling takes a number of hours equal to the normal purchase DC of the item.
