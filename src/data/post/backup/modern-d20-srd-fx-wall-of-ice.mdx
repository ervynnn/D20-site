    This spell creates an anchored plane of ice or a hemisphere of ice, depending on the version selected. A wall of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Fire, including fire spells, can melt a wall of ice. Fire deals full

    to the wall (instead of the normal half damage suffered by objects). Suddenly melting the wall of ice (by reducing it to 0

(20% miss chance) with respect to one another.

    Ice Plane: A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level. It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster levels. The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.




    Each 10-foot square of wall has 3

per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of wall whose

    Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it takes 1d6 points of cold

    +1 point per caster level.




    Hemisphere: The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet +1 foot per caster level.  It is as hard to break through as the ice plane form, but it does not deal

    The caster can create the hemisphere so that it traps one or more creatures, though these creatures can avoid being trapped by the hemisphere by making successful
