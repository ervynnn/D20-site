###

     Sweep




     An Infiltrator knows how to size up an area and get the lay of the land in a single sweep of his or her eyes. This sweep provides a +4 circumstance bonus on
     [
      Spot
     ](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index)
     checks and covers an area out to 30 feet away from the Infiltrator. The Infiltrator can use this bonus at the start of an encounter.




     Anything not concealed can be spotted in a sweep with a successful
     [
      check
     ](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index)
     (DC 10). The DC for concealed or less obvious threats is equal to their
     [
      Hide
     ](modern-d20-srd-skills-hide)

[
check
](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index)
result.

###

     Improvised Implements




     At 2nd level, an Infiltrator no longer takes a 4 penalty when wielding an improvised weapon. Also, the Infiltrator is able to make do without proper equipment in certain circumstances: the Infiltrator no longer takes a 4 penalty when using the
     [
      Climb
     ](modern-d20-srd-skills-climb)
     and
     [
      Disable

Device
](modern-d20-srd-skills-disable-device)
skills without the proper tools.

###

     Improved Evasion




     If an Infiltrator of 4th level or higher is exposed to any effect that normally allows a character to attempt a Reflex
     [
      saving throw
     ](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
     for half
     [
      damage
     ](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
     , the Infiltrator suffers no damage if he or she makes a successful
     [
      saving throw
     ](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
     and only half
     [
      damage
     ](file:-C|-Documents%20and%20Settings-All%20Users-Documents-d20resources-modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
     on a failed
     [
      save
     ](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
     . Improved evasion can only be used when wearing
     [
      light

armor
](modern-d20-srd-equipment-armor-light)
or no armor.

     For an Infiltrator who does not have evasion (see the
     [
      Fast

hero
](modern-d20-srd-classes-basic-fast-hero)
class description), improved evasion counts as evasion for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites on the
[
Fast
heros
](modern-d20-srd-classes-basic-fast-hero)
defensive talent tree.

###

     Skill Mastery




     At 5th level, an Infiltrator selects a number of skills from his or her class list equal to 3 + his or her
     [
      Intelligence
     ](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)
     modifier. When making a
     [
      check
     ](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index)
     using one of these skills, the Infiltrator may
     [
      take

10
](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index)
even if stress and distractions would normally prevent him or her from doing so.

###

     Improvised Weapon Damage




     At 7th level, an Infiltrators
     [
      attacks
     ](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll)
     with improvised weapons deal more
     [
      damage
     ](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
     . The Infiltrator treats an improvised weapon as one size category larger than it is for the purpose of determining the
     [
      damage
     ](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
     it deals.

###

     Improved Sweep




     At 8th level, an Infiltrators ability to get the lay of the land improves. Now the Infiltrator not only spots potential perils with a successful check, he or she can determine the relative strength of these dangers. A successful
     [
      check
     ](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index)
     relates the dangers strength compared to the Infiltrator: stronger (higher level or Hit Dice), on par (same level or HD), or weaker (lower level or HD).

###

     Without a Trace




     At 10th level, when an Infiltrator uses any of the following skills:
     [
      Balance
     ](modern-d20-srd-skills-balance)
     ,
     [
      Climb
     ](modern-d20-srd-skills-climb)
     ,
     [
      Disable

Device
](modern-d20-srd-skills-disable-device)
,
[
Escape Artist
](modern-d20-srd-skills-escape-artist)
,
[
Hide
](modern-d20-srd-skills-hide)
,
[
Move
Silently
](modern-d20-srd-skills-move-silently)
, and
[
Sleight
of Hand
](modern-d20-srd-skills-sleight-of-hand)
, those using
[
Investigate
](modern-d20-srd-skills-investigate)
,
[
Listen
](modern-d20-srd-skills-listen)
,
[
Search
](modern-d20-srd-skills-search)
, or
[
Spot
](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot)
to detect the Infiltrators activity take a 4 penalty.
