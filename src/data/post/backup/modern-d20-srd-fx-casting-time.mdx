## Casting Time

This entry tells how much time is needed to complete the casting of a spell once it is begun.

Casting a spell with a casting time of 1 action is an [attack
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions). The spell takes effect immediately.

Casting a spell with a casting time of 1 full round is a [full-round
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions). A character can take a 5-foot step before, during, or after casting, but you cannot otherwise move. The spell takes effect at the beginning of that characters turn in the round after he or she began to cast it. The character then acts normally after the casting is completed.

A spell that takes 1 minute to cast comes into effect just before the characters turn 1 minute later (the character spends each of those 10 rounds casting as a [full-round
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions)).

When a character begins a spell that takes 1 full round or longer to cast, he or she must continue the invocations, gestures, and/or [concentration](modern-d20-srd-skills-concentration) from one round to just before his or her turn in the next round (at least). If the character loses [concentration](modern-d20-srd-skills-concentration) after starting the casting and before it is complete, the spell is lost (see the [Concentration](modern-d20-srd-skills-concentration) skill).

A character retains his or her [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) bonus to [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) while casting a spell.

[Attacks of Opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity):
Generally, if a character attempts to cast a spell, he or she provokes [attacks
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity) from threatening enemies. Table:
FX Actions in Combat specifies whether a certain activity provokes [attacks
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity). If a character takes damage from an [attack
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity),
he or she must make a [Concentration](modern-d20-srd-skills-concentration) check or lose the spell he or she was trying
to cast.

Casting on the Defensive: A character may attempt to cast a spell while on the
defensive. This option means casting the spell while paying attention to threats
and avoiding blows. In this case, the character are no more vulnerable to attack
than he or she would be if the character was just standing there, so casting
while on the defensive does not provoke an [attack
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity). It does,
however, require a [Concentration](modern-d20-srd-skills-concentration) check (DC 15 + spell level) to pull off. Failure
means the spell is lost..
