     ](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)
     score of 6 or higher.  The manifester can communicate telepathically through the bond even if he or she does not share a common language with the subject. No special power or influence is established as a result of the bond and the target is not compelled to communicate with the manifester.  Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance.
