## Actions in Combat

The fundamental actions of moving and attacking cover most of what a character wants to do in a battle. Theyre described here. Other, more specialized options are touched on in Table: Actions in Combat, and covered in [Special
Initiative Actions](modern-d20-srd-combat-special-initiative-actions) and [Special
Attacks](modern-d20-srd-combat-index-php#special-attacks-index).

### The Combat Round

Each round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. A round is an opportunity for each character involved in a combat to take an action. Anything a person could reasonably do in 6 seconds, a character can do in 1 round.

Each rounds activity begins with the character with the highest [initiative](modern-d20-srd-combat-initiative) result and then proceeds, in order, from there. Each round of a combat uses the same [initiative](modern-d20-srd-combat-initiative) order. When a characters turn comes up in the [initiative](modern-d20-srd-combat-initiative) sequence, that character performs his or her entire rounds worth of actions. (For exceptions, see [Attacks
of Opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity) and [Special
Initiative Actions](modern-d20-srd-combat-special-initiative-actions).)

For almost all purposes, there is no relevance to the end of a round or the beginning of a round. A round can be a segment of game time starting with the first character to act and ending with the last, but it usually means a span of time from a certain round to the same initiative number in the next round. Effects that last a certain number of rounds end just before the same initiative count that they began on.

| 1Regardless of the action, if a character moves out of a threatened square, the character usually provokes an [attack
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity). This column indicates whether the action itself, not moving, provokes an [attack
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity).
2If the object is being held, carried, or worn by a creature, yes. If not, no.
3If the character has a base attack bonus of +1 or higher, he or she can combine this action with a regular move. If the character has the [Two-Weapon
Fighting](modern-d20-srd-feats-two-weapon-fighting) feat, he or she can draw two light or one-handed weapons in the time it would normally take to draw one.
4These attack forms substitute for a melee attack, not an action. As melee attacks, they can be used once in an attack or charge action, one or more times in a full attack action, or even as an attack of opportunity.
5The description of a feat defines its effect. | |
