## Damage Reduction (Su)

The creature ignores [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) from most weapons and natural [attacks](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions). Wounds heal immediately, or the [weapon](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-weapons) bounces off harmlessly (in either case, the opponent knows the [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) was ineffective). The creature takes normal damage from energy attacks (even nonmagical ones), [spells](modern-d20-srd-fx-index), spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. A [magic
weapon](modern-d20-srd-fx-items-weapons) or a creature with its own damage reduction can sometimes [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) the creature normally, as noted below.

The entry indicates the amount of [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) ignored and the type of [weapon](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-weapons) that negates the ability.

Any [weapon](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-weapons) more powerful than the type listed in the note also negates the ability. A [weapon](modern-d20-srd-fx-items-weapons) with an enhancement bonus due to magic is considered more powerful than any [weapon](modern-d20-srd-fx-items-weapons) that does not have such a bonus.

For purposes of harming other creatures with damage reduction, a creatureÂ’s natural weapons count as the type that ignores its own innate damage reduction. However, damage reduction from [spells](modern-d20-srd-fx-index) does not confer this ability. The amount of damage reduction is irrelevant.
