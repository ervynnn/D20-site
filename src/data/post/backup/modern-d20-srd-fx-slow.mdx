## Slow

Transmutation

[Level](modern-d20-srd-fx-level): [Mage](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-mage) 3; [Components](modern-d20-srd-fx-components): V, S, M; [Casting Time](modern-d20-srd-fx-casting-time); [Attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) [Range](modern-d20-srd-fx-range): Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels); [Targets](modern-d20-srd-fx-target): One creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart; [Duration](modern-d20-srd-fx-duration): 1 round/level; [Saving Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): Will negates; [Spell Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance): Yes

Affected creatures move and attack at a drastically slowed rate. Slowed creatures can take only a single [move
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions) or [attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) each turn, but not both (nor may they take [full-round
actions](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions)). Additionally, they suffer Â–2 penalties to Defense, melee [attack
rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll), melee [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) rolls, and [Reflex
saves](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws). Slowed creatures [jump](modern-d20-srd-skills-jump) half as far as normal.

Slow counters and dispels [haste](modern-d20-srd-fx-haste) but does not otherwise affect magically speeded or slowed creatures.
