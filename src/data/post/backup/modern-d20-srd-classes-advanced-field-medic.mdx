### Class Features

The following features pertain to the Field Medic advanced class.

### Medical Specialist

The Field Medic receives a competence bonus on [Treat
Injury](modern-d20-srd-skills-treat-injury) checks. At 1st level, the bonus is +1. It increases to +2 at 5th level, and to +3 at 8th level.

### Expert Healer

At 2nd level and higher, the Field Medics ability to restore [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points) with a medical kit or surgery kit and a successful use of the [Treat
Injury](modern-d20-srd-skills-treat-injury) skill improves. In addition to the normal [hit
point](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points) recovery rate (1d4 for a medical kit, 1d6 per patients character level for surgery), the Field Medic restores 1 [hit
point](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points) for every level he or she has in this advanced class.

### Bonus Feats

At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Field Medic gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Field Medic must meet all the prerequisites of the feat to select it.

[Armor Proficiency
(light)](modern-d20-srd-feats-armor-proficiency-light), [Armor
Proficiency (medium)](modern-d20-srd-feats-armor-proficiency-medium), [Cautious](modern-d20-srd-feats-cautious), [Defensive
Martial Arts](modern-d20-srd-feats-defensive-martial-arts), [Dodge](modern-d20-srd-feats-dodge), [Educated](modern-d20-srd-feats-educated),
[Improved Initiative](modern-d20-srd-feats-improved-initiative), [Medical
Expert](modern-d20-srd-feats-medical-expert), [Personal
Firearms Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-personal-firearms-proficiency), [Surface
Vehicle Operation](modern-d20-srd-feats-surface-vehicle-operation), [Vehicle
Expert](modern-d20-srd-feats-vehicle-expert).

### Medical Mastery

When making a [Treat Injury](modern-d20-srd-skills-treat-injury) [skill check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), a Field Medic of 4th level or higher may [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) even if stress and distractions would normally prevent him or her from doing so.

### Minor Medical Miracle

At 7th level or higher, a Field Medic can save a character reduced to 10 [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points) or lower. If the Field Medic is able to administer aid within 3 rounds of the characters death, he or she can make a [Treat
Injury](modern-d20-srd-skills-treat-injury) check. The DC for this check is 30, and the Field Medic cant [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) or [take 20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index). If the check succeeds, the dead character can make a [Fortitude save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) (DC 15) to stabilize and be restored to 0 [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points).

If the Field Medic fails the [skill check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) or the patient fails the save, the dead character cant be saved.

### Medical Miracle

At 10th level, a Field Medic can revive a character reduced to 10 [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points) or lower. If the Field Medic is able to administer aid within 3 minutes of the characters death, he or she can make a [Treat
Injury](modern-d20-srd-skills-treat-injury) check. The DC for this check is 40, and the Field Medic cant [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) or [take 20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index). If the check succeeds, the dead character can make a [Fortitude save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) (DC 20) to stabilize and be restored to 1d6 [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points).

If the Field Medic fails the [skill check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) or the patient fails the [Fortitude save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws), the dead character cant be restored.
