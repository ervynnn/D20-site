## Speak Language (None) Trained Only

The Speak Language skill doesnt work like a standard skill.

- A character automatically knows how to speak his or her native language; the character does not need ranks to do so.
- Each additional language costs 1 rank. When a character adds a rank to Speak Language, he or she chooses a new language that he or she can speak.
- A character never makes Speak Language [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). A character either knows how to speak and understand a specific language or doesnt.
- To be able to read and write a language that the character can speak, he or she must take the [Read/Write
  Language](modern-d20-srd-skills-read-write-language) skill for the appropriate language.
- A character can choose any language, modern or ancient. (See the table accompanying [Read/Write
  Language](modern-d20-srd-skills-read-write-language) for suggestions.) The GM might determine that a character cant learn a specific language due to the circumstances of the campaign.
