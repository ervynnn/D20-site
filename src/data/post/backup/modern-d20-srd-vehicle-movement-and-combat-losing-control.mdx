## Losing Control

A [collision](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming) or a failed [stunt](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-stunts) can cause a driver to lose control of his [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles). In these cases, the driver must make a [Drive](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics) to retain control of the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles). If this [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics) is successful, the driver maintains control of the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles). If it fails, the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) goes into a spin. If it fails by 10 or more, the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) rolls. Remember that the check/roll modifier from [Table:
Vehicle Speeds and Modifiers](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed) applies to all [Drive](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics).

An out-of-control [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) may strike an object or other [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles). When that happens, a [collision](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming) occurs (see [Collisions
and Ramming](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming)).

Spin: The [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) skids, spinning wildly.

At character [scale](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-scale), the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) moves in its current direction a number of squares equal to the turn number for its [speed](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed), then ends its movement. Once it stops, roll 1d8 to determine its new facing: 1, no change; 2, right 45 degrees; 3, right 90 degrees; 4, right 135 degrees; 5, 180 degrees; 6, left 135 degrees; 7, left 90 degrees; 8, left 45 degrees. Reorient the vehicle accordingly.

At chase [scale](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-scale), the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) moves 1 square and ends its movement. Roll to determine its new facing as indicated above.

Roll: The [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) tumbles, taking [damage](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-damaging-vehicles).

At character [scale](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-scale), the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) rolls in a straight line in its current direction for a number of squares equal to the [turn
number](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed) for its [speed](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed), then ends its movement. At the end of the [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) roll, reorient the vehicle perpendicular to its original direction of travel (determine left or right randomly).

At chase [scale](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-scale), the vehicle rolls one square before stopping and reorienting.

At either [scale](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-scale), a [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) takes [damage](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-damaging-vehicles) equal to 2d6 x the [character
scale turn number](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed) for its [speed](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed) (use the turn number from character [scale](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed) even at chase [scale](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed)). The [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) [occupants](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-damage-to-vehicle-occupants) take damage equal to 2d4 x the [character
scale turn number](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed) for its [speed](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed) ([Reflex
save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws), DC 15, for half damage).
