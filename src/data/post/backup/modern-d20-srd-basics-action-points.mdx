## Action Points

Action points provide characters with the means to affect game play in significant ways. A character always has a limited amount of action points, and while the character replenishes this supply with every new level he or she attains, the character must use them wisely. A character can spend 1 action point to do one of these things:

Alter a single d20 roll used to make an attack, a [skill
check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), an [ability
check](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores), a level check, or a [saving
throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws).

Use a class talent or class feature during your turn for which the expenditure of 1 action point is required.

When a character spends 1 action point to improve a d20 roll, add 1d6 to the d20 roll to help meet or exceed the target number. A character can declare the use of 1 action point to alter a d20 roll after the roll is madebut
only before the GM reveals the result of that roll (whether the attack or check
or saving throw succeeded or failed). A character cant use an action point on a skill check or ability check when he or she is taking 10 or taking 20.

When a character spends 1 action point to use a class feature, he or she gains the benefit of the feature but doesnt roll a d6. In this case, the action point is not a bonus to a d20 roll.

A character can only spend 1 action point in a round. If a character spends a point to use a class feature, he or she cant spend another one in the same round to improve a die roll, and vice versa.

Depending on the heros character level (see the table below), he or she may be able to roll more than one d6 when spending 1 action point. If the character does so, apply the highest result and disregard the other rolls.

| Character Level | Action Point Dice Rolled |
| :-------------- | -----------------------: |
| 1st7th          |                      1d6 |
| 8th14th         |                      2d6 |
| 15th20th        |                      3d6 |
