Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Undead receive either [Archaic
Weapons Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-archaic-weapons-proficiency) or [Simple
Weapons Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-simple-weapons-proficiency) as a bonus feat. An undead is proficient with its natural weapons and any weapon mentioned in its entry. Undead noted for wearing armor gain the bonus feat Armor Proficiency with whatever type of armor they are accustomed to wearing ([light](modern-d20-srd-feats-armor-proficiency-light), [medium](modern-d20-srd-feats-armor-proficiency-medium), [heavy](modern-d20-srd-feats-armor-proficiency-heavy)), as well as all lighter types.

Ability Scores: An undead has no [Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) score. It uses its [Charisma](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier for [Concentration](modern-d20-srd-skills-concentration) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

[Darkvision](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-darkvision) (Ex): Most undead have [darkvision](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-darkvision) with a range of 60 feet.

Immunities: Undead are immune to [poison](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-poison), sleep, paralysis, stunning, [disease](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-disease), necromantic effects, and mind-affecting effects. They are not subject to [critical
hits](modern-d20-srd-combat-critical-hits), nonlethal [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage), ability damage, ability drain, energy drain, or effects of massive damage, or any effect requiring a Fortitude save unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless.

Healing: Undead cannot heal [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) on their own if they have no [Intelligence](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) score. Undead can be healed with negative energy (usually only available through the use of magic). Most undead are destroyed immediately if reduced to 0 [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points) or less.

Special: Undead cannot be raised from the dead.
