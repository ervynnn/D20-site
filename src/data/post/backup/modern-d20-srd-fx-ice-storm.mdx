## Ice Storm

Evocation [Cold]

Hail falls for one full round, dealing 3d6 points of bludgeoning [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) and 2d6 points of cold [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) to creatures in their path. [Listen](modern-d20-srd-skills-listen) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) made within the ice storms effect take a 4 penalty, and all ground movement within its area is at half speed. At the end of the duration, the hail disappears, leaving no aftereffects (other than the damage inflicted).
