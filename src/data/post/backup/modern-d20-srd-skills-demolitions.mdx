## Demolitions (Int) Trained Only

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): Setting a simple explosive to blow up at a certain spot doesnt require a [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), but connecting and setting a detonator does. Also, placing an explosive for maximum effect against a structure calls for a [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), as does disarming an explosive device.

Set Detonator: Most explosives require a detonator to go off. Connecting a detonator to an explosive requires a Demolitions [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 10). Failure means that the explosive fails to go off as planned. Failure by 10 or more means the explosive goes off as the detonator is being installed.

A character can make an explosive difficult to disarm. To do so, the character chooses the disarm DC before making his or her [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) to set the detonator (it must be higher than 10). The characters DC to set the detonator is equal to the disarm DC.

Place Explosive Device: Carefully placing an explosive against a fixed structure (a stationary, unattended inanimate object) can maximize the damage dealt by exploiting vulnerabilities in the structures construction.

The GM makes the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (so that the character doesnt know exactly how well he or she has done). On a result of 15 or higher, the explosive deals double damage to the structure against which it is placed. On a result of 25 or higher, it deals triple damage to the structure. In all cases, it deals normal damage to all other targets within its burst radius.

Disarm Explosive Device: Disarming an explosive that has been set to go off requires a Demolitions [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). The DC is usually 10, unless the person who set the detonator chose a higher disarm DC. If the character fails the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), he or she does not disarm the explosive. If the character fails by more than 5, the explosive goes off.

Special: A character can [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) when using the Demolitions skill, but cant [take
20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index).

A character with the [Cautious](modern-d20-srd-feats-cautious) feat and at least 1 rank in this skill gets a +2 bonus on all Demolitions [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

A character without a [demolitions
kit](modern-d20-srd-equipment-professional-equipment) takes a 4 penalty on Demolitions [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

Making an explosive requires the [Craft
(chemical)](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft-chemical) skill. See that skill description for details.

Time: Setting a detonator is usually a [full-round
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions). Placing an explosive device takes 1 minute or more, depending on the scope of the job.
