     The manifester plants a compelling attraction in the mind of the target. The attraction can be toward a particular person, an object, an action, or an event. The powers target takes reasonable steps to meet, get close to, attend, find, or perform the object of its implanted attraction. For the purposes of this power, reasonable means that while fascinated, the target doesnt suffer from blind obsession. The target will not undertake obviously self-destructive actions.  The subject can still recognize danger, but will not flee unless the threat is immediate. If the manifester makes the target feel an attraction to the manifester, the manifester cant command the subject indiscriminately, although he or she will be willing to listen to the manifester (even if the subject disagrees). This power grants the manifester a +4 bonus to his or her
