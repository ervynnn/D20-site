## Disease

When a character is exposed to a treatable disease, the character must make an immediate Fortitude [saving
throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws). The victim must make this roll when he or she comes into contact with an infectious carrier, touches an item smeared with diseased matter, consumes food or drink tainted with a disease, or suffers damage from a contaminated attack. If the character succeeds, the disease has no effect on him or herthe characters immune system fights off the infection. If the character fails the [save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws), he or she takes [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) after an incubation period; once per day thereafter, the character must succeed at a Fortitude [saving
throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) to avoid secondary [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage). Two successful [saving
throws](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) in a row indicate that the character has fought off the disease and recovers, taking no more [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage).

The characteristics of some treatable diseases are summarized on Table: Diseases.

Type: The diseases method of deliveryingested, inhaled, or via an injuryand the DC needed to [save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws). Some injury diseases can be transmitted by a wound as small as an insect bite. Most diseases that are inhaled can also be ingested (and vice versa).

Incubation Period: The amount of time before initial damage takes effect (if the victim fails his or her [Fortitude
save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)).

Initial Damage: The damage the victim takes after the incubation period.

Secondary Damage: The amount of damage the hero takes one day after taking initial damage, if he or she fails a second [saving
throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws). This damage is taken each day the [saving
throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) fails.
