## Sense Motive (Wis)

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): A successful [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) allows the character to avoid being bluffed (see the [Bluff](modern-d20-srd-skills-bluff) skill). Sense Motive does not, however, allow a character to determine whether a given statement is a lie. The character can also use the skill to tell when someone is behaving oddly or to assess someones trustworthiness. In addition, a character can use this skill to make an assessment of a social situation. With a successful [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 20), the character can get the feeling from anothers behavior that something is wrong. Also, the character can get the feeling that someone is trustworthy and honorable.

Try Again?: No, though the character may make a Sense Motive [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) for each [bluff](modern-d20-srd-skills-bluff) made on the character.

Special: A character can [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) when making a Sense Motive [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), but cant [take
20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index).

A character with the [Attentive](modern-d20-srd-feats-attentive) feat gets a +2 bonus on all Sense Motive [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

A character can use Sense Motive to detect that a hidden message is being transmitted via the [Bluff](modern-d20-srd-skills-bluff) skill (DC equal to the [bluff](modern-d20-srd-skills-bluff) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) result of the sender). If the characters check result beats the DC by 5 or more, the character understands the secret message as well. If the characters [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) fails by 5 or more, the character misinterprets the message in some fashion.

Time: A Sense Motive [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) may be made as a reaction to another characters [Bluff](modern-d20-srd-skills-bluff) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). (When thats the case, the GM may roll the characters Sense Motive [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) in secret, so the character doesnt necessarily know someones trying to bluff him or her.) Using Sense Motive to get a sense of someones trustworthiness takes at least 1 minute.
