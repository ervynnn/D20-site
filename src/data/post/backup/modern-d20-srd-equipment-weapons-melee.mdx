## Melee Weapons

Melee weapons are used in close combat, and they are generally among the simplest types of weapons. The feat that provides proficiency with these weapons varies from weapon to weapon; some are considered simple weapons (covered by the [Simple
Weapons Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-simple-weapons-proficiency) feat); others are archaic ([Archaic
Weapons Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-archaic-weapons-proficiency)) or exotic ([Exotic
Melee Weapon Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-exotic-firearms-proficiency)).

A characters [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier is always added to a melee weapons [attack
roll](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) and [damage roll](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage).

### Melee Weapons Table

Melee weapons are described by a number of statistics, as shown on Table: Melee Weapons.

[Damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage): The [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) the weapon deals on a successful hit.

[Critical](modern-d20-srd-combat-critical-hits): The threat range for a [critical
hit](modern-d20-srd-combat-critical-hits). If the threat is confirmed, a weapon deals double damage on a [critical
hit](modern-d20-srd-combat-critical-hits) (roll damage twice, as if hitting the target two times).

Damage Type: Melee weapon [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) is classified according to type: bludgeoning (weapons with a blunt striking surface), energy (of a specific type), piercing (weapons with a sharp point), and slashing (weapons with an edged blade). Some creatures or characters may be resistant or immune to some forms of damage.

Range Increment: Melee weapons that are designed to be thrown can be used to make ranged attacks. As such, they have a range increment just as other ranged weapons dobut the maximum range for a thrown weapon is five range increments instead of ten.

Any attack at less than the given range increment is not penalized for range. However, each full range increment causes a cumulative 2 penalty on the [attack
roll](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll).

Size: Size categories for weapons and other objects are defined differently from the size categories for creatures. The relationship between a weapons size and that of its wielder defines whether it can be used one-handed, if it requires two hands, and if its a light weapon.

A Medium-size or smaller weapon can be used one-handed or two-handed. A Large weapon requires two hands.

A Small or smaller weapon is considered a light weapon. It can be used one-handed and, as a light weapon, is easier to use in a characters off hand.

Weight: This column gives the weapons weight.

Purchase DC: This is the purchase DC for a [Wealth
check](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check) to acquire the weapon.

Restriction: None of the following melee weapons have restrictions on their purchase.

- [Simple Weapons](modern-d20-srd-equipment-weapons-simple)
- [Archaic Weapons](modern-d20-srd-equipment-weapons-archaic)
- [Exotic Melee Weapons](modern-d20-srd-equipment-weapons-exotic)
