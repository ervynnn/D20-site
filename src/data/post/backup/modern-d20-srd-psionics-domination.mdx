    The manifester can control the actions of a Medium-size or smaller creature. The manifester establishes a telepathic link with the targets mind. If the manifester and his or her subject share a common language, the manifester can generally force the subject to perform as he or she desires, within the limits of the subjects abilities. If no common language is shared, the manifester can only communicate basic commands. The manifester knows what the target is experiencing but does not receive direct sensory input from him or her.




    The target resists this control, and if forced to take an action that goes against his or her nature he or she receives a new

with a bonus of +1 to +4, depending on the type of action required. Obviously self-destructive orders are ignored, regardless of the result of the

    Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited. The manifester need not see the target to control him or her.
