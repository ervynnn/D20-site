## Lifestyle

Lifestyle items include travel expenses, entertainment and meals beyond the ordinary, and housing, for those characters interested in buying a home rather than renting. Lifestyle items are shown on the table below.

### Housing

| Housing      | Purchase DC |
| :----------- | ----------: |
| Small condo  |          28 |
| Large condo  |          30 |
| Small house  |          30 |
| Medium house |          32 |
| Large house  |          34 |
| Mansion      |          36 |

| Lodging       | Purchase DC |
| :------------ | ----------: |
| Budget motel  |           7 |
| Average hotel |           9 |
| Upscale hotel |          11 |

A number of types of homes are mentioned in Lifestyle. The purchase DC covers
the down payment, not the total cost of the home. (A character buying a home
does
not
have to worry about mortgage payments; they simply replace the heros rent,
which is already accounted for in the [Wealth](modern-d20-srd-wealth-index) system) The small house and condo
are one- or two-bedroom homes, probably with curbside parking. The large condo
and medium house are three-bedroom homes with garage or carport parking for
one or two cars. The large house is a four-bedroom home with a two-car garage,
while the mansion is a five- or six-bedroom home with an extra den, spacious
rooms throughout, and a three-car garage. All of these homes are of typical
construction; luxury appointments or avant garde design is available with a
+2 increase to the purchase DC.

Location dramatically affects a homes value. The given purchase DC assumes a typical suburban location. An undesirable location, such as a bad neighborhood or a remote rural site, reduces the purchase DC by 2. A particularly good location in an upscale neighborhood or city center increases the purchase DC by 2.

### Entertainment

Purchase DCs are given for several entertainment options. They represent the purchase of a single ticket. A pair of tickets can be purchased together; doing so increases the purchase DC by 2.

| Entertainment         | Purchase DC |
| :-------------------- | ----------: |
| Movie ticket          |           3 |
| Theater ticket        |           7 |
| Sporting event ticket |           7 |

### Meals

Several typical meal costs are provided. The cost of picking up the tab for additional diners adds +2 per person to the purchase DC.

| Meals              | Purchase DC |
| :----------------- | ----------: |
| Fast food          |           2 |
| Family restaurant  |           4 |
| Upscale restaurant |           7 |
| Fancy restaurant   |           9 |

### Transportation

Airfare tickets are for a single passenger round trip. One-way tickets are available, but only reduce the purchase DC by 2. Car rentals and lodging rates are per day.

| Transportation             | Purchase DC |
| :------------------------- | ----------: |
| Airfare                    |             |
| Domestic, coach            |          14 |
| Domestic, first class      |          17 |
| International, coach       |          18 |
| International, first class |          22 |
| Car rental                 |             |
| Economy car                |           6 |
| Mid-size or truck          |           8 |
| Luxury                     |          10 |
