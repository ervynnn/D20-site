## Track

Benefit: To find tracks or follow them for one mile requires a [Survival](modern-d20-srd-skills-survival) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). The character must make another [Survival](modern-d20-srd-skills-survival) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) every time the tracks become difficult to follow.

The character moves at half his or her normal speed (or at the characters normal speed with a 5 penalty on the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), or at up to twice the characters speed with a 20 penalty on the check). The DC depends on the surface and the prevailing conditions.

| Surface   | Track DC |
| :-------- | -------: |
| Very soft |        5 |
| Soft      |       10 |
| Firm      |       15 |
| Hard      |       20 |

Very Soft: Any surface (fresh snow, thick dust, wet mud) that holds deep, clear impressions of footprints.

Soft: Any surface soft enough to yield to pressure, but firmer than wet mud or fresh snow, in which the quarry leaves frequent but shallow footprints.

Firm: Most normal outdoor or exceptionally soft or dirty indoor surfaces. The quarry might leave some traces of its passage, but only occasional or partial footprints can be found.

Hard: Any surface that doesnt hold footprints at all, such as bare rock, concrete, metal deckings, or indoor floors. The quarry leaves only traces, such as scuff marks.

If the character fails a [Survival](modern-d20-srd-skills-survival) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), he or she can retry after 1 hour (out­doors) or 10 minutes (indoors) of searching.

Normal: A character without this feat can use the [Survival](modern-d20-srd-skills-survival) skill to find tracks, but can only follow tracks if the DC is 10 or less. A character can use the [Search](modern-d20-srd-skills-search) skill to find individual footprints, but cannot follow tracks using
[Search](modern-d20-srd-skills-search).
