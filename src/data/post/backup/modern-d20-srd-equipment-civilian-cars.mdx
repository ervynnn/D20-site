Most new civilian cars include such standard features as air conditioning, air bags, antilock brakes, cruise control, keyless entry, and an AM/FM radio with CD player. Luxury vehicles often also include extras such as heated side mirrors, power seats, leather upholstery, and sunroofs. In general, these luxury amenities can be added to a nonluxury car with an increase of 1 to the vehicles purchase DC.

Unless otherwise noted, civilian cars provide three-quarters [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover) for their occupants (although passengers who lean out of windows or sunroofs, perhaps to fire weapons, may be reduced to one-half or even one-quarter [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover)).
