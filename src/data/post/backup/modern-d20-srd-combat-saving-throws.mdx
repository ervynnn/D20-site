    Saving Throws




    Generally, when a character is subject to an unusual or magical attack, he or she gets a saving throw to avoid or reduce the effect. A saving throw is a 1d20 roll plus a bonus based on the characters class and level (the characters base save bonus) and an

.

    A natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on a saving throw is always a failure. A natural 20 (the d20 comes up 20) is always a success.




    A characters saving throw bonus is:

    The Difficulty Class for a save is determined by the attack itself.

    Saving Throw Types




    The three different kinds of saving throws are:




    Fortitude: These saves measure a characters ability to stand up to massive physical punishment or attacks against his or her vitality and health such as poison and paralysis. Apply a characters Constitution modifier to his or her Fortitude saving throws.




    Reflex: These saves test a characters ability to dodge massive attacks such as explosions or car wrecks. (Often, when damage is inevitable, a character gets to make a Reflex save to take only half damage.) Apply the characters Dexterity modifier to his or her Reflex saving throws.




    Will: These saves reflect a characters resistance to mental influence and domination as well as to many magical effects. Apply the characters Wisdom modifier to his or her Will saving throws.
