## Fiend

Fiends vary wildly. GMs are encouraged to design their own fiends using the information provided in the Table: Outsiders and below. Several sample fiends are given below.

### Species Traits

Fiends have the following traits.

Variable Size: Depending on their size, fiends gain a size bonus or penalty on attack rolls, a size bonus or penalty to Defense, and a size bonus or penalty on [Hide](modern-d20-srd-skills-hide) checks and grapple checks. See Table: Creature Sizes for attack and Defense modifiers based on size, as well as for a fiends typical fighting space and reach.

Natural Armor: A fiend has preternaturally tough skin and gains a natural armor bonus to Defense. The bonus depends on its size, and higher bonuses are allowable: Tiny or smaller +2, Small +5, Medium-size +9, Large +14, Huge +16, Gargantuan +18, Colossal +20.

Immunities (Ex): A fiend is immune to one or more specific types of [energy](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-resistance-to-energy) or [weapon
damage](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-damage-reduction). Roll on Table: Fiend Immunities, Resistances, and [Damage Reduction](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-damage-reduction).

[Resistance to Energy](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-resistance-to-energy) (Ex): A fiend is resistant to one or more specific types of energy damage. Roll on Table: Fiend Immunities, Resistances, and [Damage Reduction](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-damage-reduction).

[Damage Reduction](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-damage-reduction) (Su): Some fiends have [damage reduction](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-damage-reduction). Roll on Table: Fiend Immunities, Resistances, and [Damage Reduction](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-damage-reduction) to determine whether a fiend has [damage reduction](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-damage-reduction). If the campaign includes few or no magic weapons, the GM should consider allowing specific types of weapons to ignore a fiends [damage reduction](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-damage-reduction) or contrive some other special vulnerability (see Creature Weaknesses for suggestions).

Telepathy (Su): Fiends with an Intelligence of 6 or higher can communicate telepathically with any creature within 100 feet that has a language.

Allegiances: All fiends have a primary allegiance to evil. Fiends may also have an allegiance to either chaos or law.

Bonus Feat: Fiends gain either [Archaic
Weapons Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-archaic-weapons-proficiency) or [Simple Weapons Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-simple-weapons-proficiency) as a bonus feat.

Automatic Languages: Fiends can speak Abyssal (the language of demons) and a number of additional languages equal to their Intelligence bonus. Fiends with an Intelligence of 8 or higher can also read and write these languages.

Advancement: By character class.
