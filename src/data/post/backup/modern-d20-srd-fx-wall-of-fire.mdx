    An immobile curtain of fire springs into existence. One side of the wall, selected by the caster, sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d4 points of fire
    [
     damage
    ](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
    to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of fire
    [
     damage
    ](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
    to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears and each round that a creature enters or remains in the area. In addition, the wall deals 2d6 points of fire
    [
     damage
    ](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
    +1 point of fire
    [
     damage
    ](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
    per caster level to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double

    [
     undead

    If the caster evokes the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes
    [
     damage
    ](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
    as if passing through the wall. Each such creature can avoid the wall by making a successful
    [

save
](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
. (If the creature ends up on the hot side of the wall, it takes 2d4 points of
[
damage
](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
, as normal.)

    If any 5-foot length of wall takes 20 points of cold
    [
     damage
    ](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
    or more in 1 round, that length goes out. (Do not divide cold
    [
     damage
    ](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
    by 4, as normal for objects.)
