     Grenades and Explosives




     An explosive is a weapon that, when detonated, affects all creatures and objects within its burst radius by means of shrapnel, heat, or massive concussion. Its effect is broad enough that it can hurt characters just by going off close to them.




     Some explosives, such as grenades, can be thrown, and they explode when they land. Others are planted, with fuses or timers, and go off after a preset amount of time elapses.

     Thrown Explosives

| 4                       |  Lower Left |

     An attack with a thrown explosive is a
     [
      ranged

attack
](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions)
made against a specific 5-foot square. (A character can target a square occupied by a creature.) Throwing the explosive is an
[
attack
action
](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions)
. If the square is within one range increment, you do not need to make an
[
attack
roll
](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll)
. Roll 1d4 and consult the table to see which corner of the square the explosive bounces to.

     If the target square is more than one range increment away, make an
     [
      attack

roll
](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll)
. The square has an effective
[
Defense
](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense)
of 10. Thrown weapons require no weapon proficiency, so a character doesnt take the 4 nonproficient penalty. If the attack succeeds, the grenade or explosive lands in the targeted square. Roll 1d4 and consult the table above to see which corner of the square the explosive bounces to.

     If the character misses the target, the explosive lands at a corner of a square nearby in a random direction. Consult the tables below to determine where the explosive lands. If the weapon was thrown two to three range increments (11 to 30 feet), roll 1d8.

     After determining where the explosive landed, it deals its

     to all targets within the burst radius of the weapon. The targets may make

     Planted Explosives




     A planted explosive is set in place, with a timer or fuse determining when it goes off. No

is necessary to plant an explosive; the explosive sits where it is placed until it is moved or goes off.

     When a planted explosive detonates, it deals its damage to all targets within the burst radius of the weapon. The targets may make
