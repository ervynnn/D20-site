## Improved Combat Throw

Prerequisites: [Defensive
Martial Arts](modern-d20-srd-feats-defensive-martial-arts), [Combat Throw](modern-d20-srd-feats-combat-throw), base attack bonus +3.

Benefit: In melee combat, if an opponent [attacks](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) and misses the character, the character may immediately make a [trip
attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-trip) against the opponent. This counts as an [attack
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity), which the character can make even if he or she is unarmed. Attacking unarmed in this way does not provoke an [attack
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity).

Special: This feat doesnÂ’t grant the character more [attacks
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity) than he or she is normally allowed in a round.
