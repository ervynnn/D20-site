## Scrolls

A scroll is a spell [magically](modern-d20-srd-fx-index) inscribed onto paper or parchment so that it can be used later. Once the [spell](modern-d20-srd-fx-index) is cast, the scroll becomes blank or turns to dust. Scrolls are single-use items. A scroll has a Defense of 9, hardness 0, 1 hit point, and a break DC of 8.

No preparation time is needed to cast a [spell](modern-d20-srd-fx-index) written on a scroll. The reader must perform the short, simple, finishing parts of the [spell](modern-d20-srd-fx-index). To use a scroll safely, a character must be high enough level in the right class to cast the [spell](modern-d20-srd-fx-index) already.

Activating a scroll has four prerequisites. First, the reader must be able to read the writing. This can be done with a successful Spellcraft check (DC 15 + the spells level) or a [read
magic](modern-d20-srd-fx-read-magic) spell. Second, the user must be able to cast [arcane
spells](modern-d20-srd-fx-arcane-spells) (for arcane spell scrolls) or [divine
spells](modern-d20-srd-fx-divine-spells) (for divine spell scrolls). Third, the user must have an [Intelligence](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) score high enough to cast the spell. Finally, the user must be able to see and read the text of the scroll.

If the user isnt high enough level to cast the [spell](modern-d20-srd-fx-index) normally, he or she must succeed at a caster level check (DC = the caster level of the scroll +1). If this check fails, the spell fails and disappears from the paper; the scroll is wasted.

Using a scroll is an [attack
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) that provokes [attacks
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity).

Purchase DC: A scrolls purchase DC is 15 + the scrolls caster level + spell level unless noted otherwise.
