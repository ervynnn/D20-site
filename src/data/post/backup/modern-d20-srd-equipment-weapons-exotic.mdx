Most exotic weapons are either atypical in form or improved variations of other melee weapons. Because each exotic weapon is unique in how it is manipulated and employed, a separate [Exotic
Melee Weapon Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-exotic-melee-weapons-proficiency) feat is required for each one in order to avoid the 4 nonproficient penalty.

### Chain

Also called the manriki-gusari, this is a simple chain with weighted ends. It can be whirled quickly, striking with hard blows from the weights. One end can also be swung to entangle an opponent.

The chain can be used either as a double weapon or as a reach weapon. A character can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, incurring all the normal attack penalties as if using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. In this case, the character can only strike at an adjacent opponent.

If a character uses the chain as a reach weapon, he or she can strike opponents up to 10 feet away. In addition, unlike other weapons with reach, the character can use it against an adjacent foe. In this case, the character can only use one end of the chain effectively; he or she cant use it as a double weapon.

Because a chain can wrap around an enemys leg or other limb, a character can make a [trip](modern-d20-srd-combat-trip) attack with it by succeeding at a [melee
touch attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions). If the character is [tripped](modern-d20-srd-combat-trip) during his or her own [trip](modern-d20-srd-combat-trip) attempt, the character can drop the chain to avoid being tripped.

When using a chain, the character gets a +2 equipment bonus on his or her opposed [attack
roll](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) when attempting to [disarm](modern-d20-srd-combat-disarm) an opponent (including the roll to avoid being [disarmed](modern-d20-srd-combat-disarm) if the character fails to [disarm](modern-d20-srd-combat-disarm) the opponent).

A character can select the [Weapon
Finesse](modern-d20-srd-feats-weapon-finesse) feat to apply his or her [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier instead of [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier to attack rolls with a chain.

### Chain Saw

Military and police units use powered saws to cut through fences and open doors rapidly. They are sometimes pressed into service as weapons, often by people who watch too many movies.

### Kama

A kama is a wooden shaft with a scythe blade extending at a right angle out from the shaft. Kama are traditional weapons in various styles of karate.

### Katana

The katana is the traditional Japanese samurai sword. When used with the [Exotic
Melee Weapon Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-exotic-melee-weapons-proficiency) feat, it can be used with one hand. For a wielder without the feat, the katana must be used with two hands, and the standard 4 nonproficiency penalty applies.

### Kukri

This heavy, curved dagger has its sharp edge on the inside of the curve.

### Nunchaku

A popular martial arts weapon, the nunchaku is made of two wooden shafts connected by a short length of rope or chain.

### Three-Section Staff

Originally a farm implement for threshing grain, this weapon is composed of three sections of wood of equal lengths, joined at the ends by chain, leather, or rope. The three-section staff requires two hands to use.

The three-section staff is a double weapon. A character can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if he or she does, the character incurs all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, as if using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon.
