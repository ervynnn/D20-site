     The manifester gains historical vision in a given location.  The types of events most likely to leave psychic impressions are those that elicited strong emotions. Everyday occurrences leave no residue for a manifester to detect.  The vision of the event is dreamlike and shadowy. The manifester does not gain special knowledge of those involved in the vision. A manifester can sense one distinct event per round of concentration, if any exist at all. This sensitivity extends into the past a number of years equal to 100 x the manifesterÂ’s level.
