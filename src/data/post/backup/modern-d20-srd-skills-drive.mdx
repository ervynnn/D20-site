## Drive (Dex)

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): Routine tasks, such as ordinary driving, dont require a [skill
check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). Make a [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) only when some unusual circumstance exists (such as inclement weather or an icy surface), or when the character is driving during a dramatic situation (the character is being chased or attacked, for example, or is trying to reach a destination in a limited amount of time). When driving, the character can attempt simple maneuvers or stunts. See [Driving
a Vehicle](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-index) for more details.

Try Again?: Most driving checks have consequences for failure that make trying again impossible.

Special: A character can [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) when driving, but cant [take 20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index).

A character with the [Vehicle
Expert](modern-d20-srd-feats-vehicle-expert) feat gets a +2 bonus on all Drive [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

There is no penalty for operating a general-purpose motor vehicle. Other types of motor vehicles (heavy wheeled, powerboat, sailboat, ship, and tracked) require the corresponding [Surface
Vehicle Operation](modern-d20-srd-feats-surface-vehicle-operation) feat, or the character takes a 4 penalty on Drive [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

Time: A Drive [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) is a [move
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions).
