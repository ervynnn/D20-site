## Regeneration (Ex)

This ability makes the creature impervious to most types of damage. Any [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) dealt to the creature that falls below its [massive
damage threshold](modern-d20-srd-combat-death-dying-healing) doesnt reduce its [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points), unless that [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) is of a type it is specifically vulnerable to, as mentioned in the creatures description. [Massive
damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-death-dying-healing) that doesnt match the creatures vulnerability reduces its [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points), but such damage automatically heals at a fixed rate, as detailed in the creatures description. When the creature takes [massive
damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-death-dying-healing) from an attack type it isnt vulnerable to, a failed [save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) renders it dazed for 1 round (instead of reducing it to 1 hit points).

[Damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) the creature is vulnerable to deals [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) with every successful [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions). Such [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) cant be regenerated, and [massive
damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-death-dying-healing) from such an [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) follows the normal [massive
damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-death-dying-healing) rules.

Regeneration doesnt provide any benefit against attack forms that dont deal [hit
point](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points) damage. Regeneration also doesnt restore [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points) lost to [starvation](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-starvation-thirst), [thirst](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-starvation-thirst), or [suffocation](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-suffocation-drowning).

Regenerating creatures can regrow and reattach severed body parts. Severed parts that arent reattached wither and die normally. Regeneration continues to work no matter how low the creatures [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points) drop, restoring lost [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points) from any damage other than from attack forms the creature is specially vulnerable to.
