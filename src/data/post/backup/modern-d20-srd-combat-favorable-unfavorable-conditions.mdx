## Favorable and Unfavorable Conditions

Generally speaking, any situational modifier created by the attackers position or tactics applies to the attack roll, while any situational modifier created by the defenders position, state, or tactics applies to the defenders [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense). The GM judges what bonuses and penalties apply, using Table: Defense Modifiers and Table: Attack Roll Modifiers as guides.
