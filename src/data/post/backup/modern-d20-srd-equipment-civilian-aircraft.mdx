### Civilian Aircraft

All aircraft, from one-seaters to jumbo jets, are controlled by the use of the [Pilot](modern-d20-srd-skills-pilot) skill. A few examples are provided here from the variety of airgoing vehicles that might be available to characters.

### Bell Jet Ranger

This is perhaps the most common civilian helicopter worldwide; it has also been adopted by many military forces as a light utility helicopter. The Jet Ranger is two squares wide and seven squares long. It provides three-quarters [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover) for crew and passengers.

### Bell Model 212

This is the twin-engine, civilian version of the ubiquitous Huey helicopter. As a civilian aircraft, it is a sturdy, reliable helicopter used for passenger and cargo work all over the world. Military versions are still in use in many countries. The Bell 212 is three squares wide and seven squares long. It provides three-quarters [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover) for crew and passengers (one-quarter cover for passengers if the cargo doors are open).

### Cessna 172 Skyhawk

This common single-engine propeller plane is relatively inexpensive. A Cessna 172 is seven squares wide (including wings; fuselage is one square wide) and six squares long. It provides three-quarters [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover) for crew and passengers.

### Learjet Model 45

This is a sleek business jet introduced in the late 90s. Two turbofans, set on the fuselage above and behind the wings, provide the power. The interior includes luxury accommodations and a lavatory. A Learjet is ten squares wide (including wings; fuselage is two squares wide) and twelve squares long. It provides three-quarters [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover) for crew and nine-tenths [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover) for passengers.
