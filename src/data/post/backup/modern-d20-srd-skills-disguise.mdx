## Disguise (Cha)

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): A characters Disguise [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) result determines how good the disguise is. It is opposed by others [Spot](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) results. Make one Disguise [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) even if several people make Spot checks. The GM makes the characters Disguise [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) secretly so that the character is not sure how well his or her disguise holds up to scrutiny.

If the character doesnt draw any attention to him or herself, however, others dont get to make [Spot](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). If the character comes to the attention of people who are suspicious, the suspicious person gets to make a [Spot](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). (The GM can assume that such observers [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) on their [Spot](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).)

The effectiveness of the characters disguise depends in part on how much the character is attempting to change his or her appearance.

| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------: |
| Minor details only                                                                                                                                      |       +5 |
| Appropriate uniform or costume                                                                                                                          |       +2 |
| Disguised as different sex                                                                                                                              |        2 |
| Disguised as different age category                                                                                                                     |      2 1 |
| 1 Per step of difference between the characters age category and the disguised age category (child, young adult, adult, middle age, old, or venerable). |          |

If the character is impersonating a particular individual, those who know what that person looks like automatically get to make [Spot](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). Furthermore, they get a bonus on their [Spot](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

| Familiarity         | Bonus |
| :------------------ | ----: |
| Recognizes on sight |    +4 |
| Friend or associate |    +6 |
| Close friend        |    +8 |
| Intimate            |   +10 |

Usually, an individual makes a [Spot](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) to detect a disguise immediately upon meeting the character and each hour thereafter. If the character casually meets many different people, each for a short time, the GM checks once per day or hour, using an average [Spot](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot) modifier for the group (assuming they [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index)).

Try Again?: No, though the character can assume the same disguise again at a later time. If others saw through the previous disguise, they are automatically treated as suspicious if the character assumes the same disguise again.

Special: A character can [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) or [take 20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index) when establishing a disguise.

A character without a [disguise
kit](modern-d20-srd-equipment-professional-equipment) takes a 4 penalty on Disguise [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

A character with the [Deceptive](modern-d20-srd-feats-deceptive) feat gets a +2 bonus on all Disguise [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

A character can help someone else create a disguise for him or her, treating it as an [aid
another](modern-d20-srd-combat-aid-another) attempt.

Time: A Disguise [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) requires 1d4 x10 minutes of preparation. The GM makes [Spot](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) for those who encounter the character immediately upon meeting the character and again each hour or day thereafter, depending on circumstances.
