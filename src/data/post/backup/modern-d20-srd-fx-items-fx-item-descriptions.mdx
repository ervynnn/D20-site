     FX Item Descriptions




     Each entry includes a description of the item and its game effects. Following the description is a line indicating the caster level or manifester level of the effect, the items type, a typical purchase DC, and the items weight (in pounds).




     The GM may increase the purchase DC of an item to account for its rarity in the campaign or lower the purchase DC of items that are readily available and easy to mass-produce.
