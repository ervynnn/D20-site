## Keen Edge

Transmutation

[Level](modern-d20-srd-fx-level): [Mage](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-mage) 3; [Components](modern-d20-srd-fx-components): V, S; [Casting Time](modern-d20-srd-fx-casting-time); [Attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) [Range](modern-d20-srd-fx-range): Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels); [Targets](modern-d20-srd-fx-target): One weapon or 50 projectiles, all of which must be in contact with each other at the time of casting; [Duration](modern-d20-srd-fx-duration): 10 minutes/level; [Saving Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): Will negates (harmless, object); [Spell Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance): Yes (harmless, object)

This transmutation doubles the [threat
range](modern-d20-srd-combat-critical-hits) of the weapon. A [threat
range](modern-d20-srd-combat-critical-hits) of 20 becomes 1920. A [threat
range](modern-d20-srd-combat-critical-hits) of 1920 becomes 1720. A [threat
range](modern-d20-srd-combat-critical-hits) of 1820 becomes 1520. The spell can be cast only on piercing or slashing weapons (and it does not stack with itself). If cast on arrows or crossbow bolts, the keen edge on a particular projectile ends after one use, whether or not the missile strikes its intended target.

This spell cannot be cast on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike.
