## Attack Bonus

A characters attack bonus with a melee weapon is:
Base attack bonus + [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier + size modifier

With a ranged weapon, a characters attack bonus is:
Base attack bonus + [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier + range penalty + size modifier

### Strength Modifier

[Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) helps a character swing a weapon harder and faster, so a characters [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier applies to [melee
attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) rolls.

### Size Modifier

| Table: Size Modifiers                 |     |
| :------------------------------------ | --: |
|                                       |     |
| Colossal (blue whale [90 ft. long])   |   8 |
| Gargantuan (gray whale [40 ft. long]) |   4 |
| Huge (elephant)                       |   2 |
| Large (lion)                          |   1 |
| Medium-size (human)                   |  +0 |
| Small (German shepherd)               |  +1 |
| Tiny (housecat)                       |  +2 |
| Diminutive (rat)                      |  +4 |
| Fine (horsefly)                       |  +8 |

Creature size categories are defined differently from the size categories for weapons and other objects. Since this size modifier applies to [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) against a melee weapon [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) or a ranged weapon [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll), two creatures of the same size strike each other normally, regardless of what size they actually are. Creature sizes are compatible with vehicle sizes.

### Dexterity Modifier

[Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) measures coordination and steadiness, so a characters [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier applies when the character attacks with a ranged weapon.

### Range Penalty

The range penalty for a ranged weapon depends on what weapon the character
is using and how far away the target is. All ranged [weapons](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-weapons) and thrown [weapons](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-weapons) have a range increment. Any attack from a distance of less than one range
increment is not penalized for range. However, each full range increment causes
a cumulative 2 penalty on the [attack
roll](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll). A thrown weapon has a maximum range
of five range increments. Ranged weapons that fire projectiles can shoot up
to ten increments.
