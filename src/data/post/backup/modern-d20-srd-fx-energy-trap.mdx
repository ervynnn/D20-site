## Energy Trap

Abjuration

[Level](modern-d20-srd-fx-level): [Mage](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-mage) 4; [Components](modern-d20-srd-fx-components): V, S, M; [Casting Time](modern-d20-srd-fx-casting-time): 10 minutes; [Range](modern-d20-srd-fx-range): Touch; [Target](modern-d20-srd-fx-target): Object touched; [Duration](modern-d20-srd-fx-duration): Permanent until discharged (D); [Saving Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): Reflex half (see text); [Spell Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance): Yes

Energy trap creates an explosion of one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic/concussion) when an intruder opens the item that the trap wards. The energy trap can ward any closeable item. When casting energy trap, the caster selects the energy type and a point on the item as the spells center. When someone other than the caster opens the item, the resulting explosion fills the area within a 5-foot radius around the spells center. The energy blast deals 1d4 points of [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) (of the given energy type) +1 point per caster level. The item protected by the trap is not harmed by this explosion.

The warded item cannot have a second closure or warding spell placed on it.

An unsuccessful [dispel magic](modern-d20-srd-fx-dispel-magic) spell does not detonate the spell.

Underwater, the acid and fire versions of this spell deal half [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage).

The caster can use the trapped object without discharging it, as can any individual to whom the spell was specifically attuned when cast. Attuning to an individual usually involves denoting a password that the caster can share with friends.

A successful [Search](modern-d20-srd-skills-search) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 29) finds an energy trap, and a successful [Disable
Device](modern-d20-srd-skills-disable-device) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 29) safely removes it.

Material [Components](modern-d20-srd-fx-components): Purchase DC 10.
