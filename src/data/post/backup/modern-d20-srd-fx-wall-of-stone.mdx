## Wall of Stone

Conjuration (Creation)

[Level](modern-d20-srd-fx-level): [Acolyte](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-acolyte) 5, [Mage](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-mage) 5; [Components](modern-d20-srd-fx-components): V, S, M/DF; [Casting Time](modern-d20-srd-fx-casting-time); [Attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) [Range](modern-d20-srd-fx-range): Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level); Effect: Stone wall whose area is up to one 5-ft. square/level (S); [Duration](modern-d20-srd-fx-duration): Instantaneous; [Saving Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): See text; [Spell Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance): No

This spell creates a wall of rock that merges into adjoining rock surfaces. The wall of stone is 1 inch thick per four caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. You can double the walls area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.

A wall of stone can be created in almost any shape the caster desires. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. If used to bridge a chasm, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spells area by half.

Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by explosives or brought down by bludgeoning or piercing weapons. Each 5-foot square has 15 [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points) per inch of thickness and hardness 8. A section of wall whose [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points) drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness.

It is possible to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures. Creatures avoid entrapment with successful [Reflex
saves](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws).
