## Gather Information (Cha)

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): By succeeding at a skill [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 10) and spending 1d4+1 hours passing out money and buying drinks, a character can get a feel for the major news items in a neighborhood. This result assumes that no obvious reasons exist why information would be withheld. The higher the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) result, the better the information.

If the situation doesnt require the expenditure of money, no [Wealth
check](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check) is necessary.

Information ranges from general to protected, and the cost and DC increases accordingly for the type of information the character seeks to gather, as given in the table below.

| Type of Information | DC  | Purchase DC |
| :------------------ | :-: | ----------: |
| General             | 10  |           5 |
| Specific            | 15  |          10 |
| Restricted          | 20  |          15 |
| Protected           | 25  |          20 |

General information concerns local happenings, rumors, gossip, and the like. Specific information usually relates to a particular question. Restricted information includes facts that arent generally known and requires that the character locate someone who has access to such information. Protected information is even harder to come by and might involve some danger, either for the one asking the questions or the one providing the answer. Theres a chance that someone will take note of anyone asking about restricted or protected information.

The character can increase the amount of money used to gather information, gaining a circumstance bonus by effectively offering a bribe (though the process might entail buying more expensive drinks, not necessarily offering a character extra money). Increase the [Wealth
check](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check) DC by 2 for each +1 circumstance bonus the character wants to add to his or her skill check.

Try Again?: Yes, but it takes 1d4+1 hours for each [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), and characters may draw attention to themselves if they repeatedly pursue a certain type of information.

Special: A character can [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) when making a Gather Information check, but cannot [take
20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index).

A character with the [Trustworthy](modern-d20-srd-feats-trustworthy) feat gets a +2 bonus on all Gather Information [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

Time: A Gather Information [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) takes 1d4+1 hours.
