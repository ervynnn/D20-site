### Class Features

The following features pertain to the Soldier advanced class.

### Weapon Focus

At 1st level, a Soldier gains the Weapon Focus class feature, providing the benefit of the feat with the same name. The Soldier chooses a specific weapon. The soldier can choose unarmed strike or grapple as the weapon. The soldier must be proficient with the chosen weapon.

The soldier adds +1 to all attack rolls made using the selected weapon.

### Weapon Specialization

At 2nd level, a Soldier gains weapon specialization with a specific melee or ranged weapon that he or she also has applied the Weapon Focus feat or class feature to. The soldier gets a +2 bonus on damage rolls with the chosen weapon.

### Bonus Feats

At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Soldier gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Soldier must meet all the prerequisites of the feat to select it.

Advanced Firearms Proficiency, Archaic Weapons Proficiency, Armor Proficiency (light), Armor Proficiency (medium), Armor Proficiency (heavy), Brawl, Burst Fire, Cleave, Combat Reflexes, Exotic Firearms Proficiency, Exotic Melee Weapon Proficiency, Far Shot, Great Cleave, Im­proved Brawl, Improved Knockout Punch, Knockout Punch, Power Attack.

### Tactical Aid

As a full-round action, the Soldier provides tactical aid to all of his allies (including himself) within sight and voice
range of his position. This use of tactical aid requires an action point.

This aid provides a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls. The bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to one-half
of the Soldiers level in the advanced class, rounded down.

### Improved Critical

For the weapon the Soldier has applied weapon specialization to the Soldiers threat range increases by one.

### Improved Reaction
