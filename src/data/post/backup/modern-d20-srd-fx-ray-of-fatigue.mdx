## Ray of Fatigue

Necromancy

[Level](modern-d20-srd-fx-level): [Mage](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-mage) 1; [Components](modern-d20-srd-fx-components): V, S, M; [Casting Time](modern-d20-srd-fx-casting-time); [Attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) [Range](modern-d20-srd-fx-range): Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels); Effect: Ray; [Duration](modern-d20-srd-fx-duration): 1 minute/level; [Saving Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): No; [Spell Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance): Yes

The caster must succeed at a [ranged
touch attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) with the ray to strike a target. The subject is immediately fatigued for the spells duration. A fatigued character suffers a 2 penalty to [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) and [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) and cant run or charge. This spell has no effect on a creature who is already fatigued.
