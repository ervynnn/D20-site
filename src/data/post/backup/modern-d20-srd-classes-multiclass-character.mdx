     Multiclass Characters




     A character may add new classes as he or she progresses in levels, thereby becoming a multiclass character. The class abilities from all of a characters classes combine to determine a multiclass characters overall abilities.

###

     Class and Level Features




     As a general rule, the abilities of a multiclass character are the sum of the abilities provided by each of the characters classes.

###

     Level




     Character level is a characters total number of levels. It is used to determine when feats and ability score increases are gained




     Class level is the characters level in a particular class. For a hero whose levels are all in the same class, character level and class level are the same.

###

     Hit Points




     A hero gains
     [
      hit points
     ](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points)
     from each class as his or her class level increases, adding the new
     [
      hit

points
](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points)
to the previous total.

###

     Base Attack Bonus




     Add the base attack bonuses for each class to get the heros base attack bonus. A resulting value of +6 or higher provides the hero with multiple attacks.

| Base Attack Bonus | Additional Attacks at |
| :---------------- | --------------------: |
| +6                |                    +1 |
| +7                |                    +2 |
| +8                |                    +3 |
| +9                |                    +4 |
| +10               |                    +5 |
| +11               |                 +6/+1 |
| +12               |                 +7/+2 |
| +13               |                 +8/+3 |
| +14               |                 +9/+4 |
| +15               |                +10/+5 |
| +16               |             +11/+6/+1 |
| +17               |             +12/+7/+2 |
| +18               |             +13/+8/+3 |
| +19               |             +14/+9/+4 |
| +20               |            +15/+10/+5 |

     To use multiple attacks in the same round, a character must use a full attack, which is a
     [
      full-round

action
](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions)
.

###

      Saving Throws





     Add the base save bonuses for each class together.

###

      Defense

     Bonus




     Add the Defense bonuses for each class together.

###

      Reputation

     Bonus




     Add
     [
      Reputation
     ](modern-d20-srd-reputation-index)
     bonuses together.

###

      Skills





     A multiclass hero uses his or her character level to determine the maximum ranks the hero can have in a skill. If a skill is a class skill for any of a multiclass heros classes, then use character level to determine a skills maximum rank. (The maximum rank for a class skill is 3 + character level.)

When a multiclass hero gains a level in a class, he or she spends that levels skill points as a member of that class. Only that classs class skills may be purchased as class skills. All other skills, including skills for another class the hero has levels in, are considered cross-class skills when ranks in those skills are purchased at this level.

###

     Class Features




     The character gets all class features (talents, bonus
     [
      feats
     ](modern-d20-srd-feats-index)
     , or other special abilities) of all classes for the levels he or she possesses.

###

      Feats





     A multiclass character receives a new feat every three character levels, regardless of individual class level. Taking one level in a new class does not entitle a character to receive the two feats that a beginning 1st-level character gets.

###

     Ability Increases




     A multiclass character increases one
     [
      ability

score
](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)
by +1 every four character levels, regardless of individual class level.

###

     Adding a Second Class




     When a character with one class gains a level, he or she may choose to increase the level of his or her current class or pick up a new class at 1st level. This could be a
     [
      basic

class
](modern-d20-srd-classes-basic-index)
or, if the character qualifies for it, an
[
advanced
class
](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-index)
.

     The character gains the 1st-level base attack bonus, base save bonuses, class skills, other class features of the new class,
     [
      hit

points
](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points)
of the appropriate die type, and the new classs number of skill points gained at each additional level (not that number x4, as is the case for a 1st-level character).

     Picking up a new class is not exactly the same as starting a character in that class.  When picking up a new class, a hero doesnt receive maximum hit points but should roll the new Hit Die.

###

     Advancing a Level




     Each time a multiclass character attains a new level, the hero either increases one of his or her current class levels by one or picks up a new class at 1st level.




     When a multiclass character increases one of his or her class levels by one, the character gets all the standard benefits that characters receive for attaining the new level in that class: more
     [
      hit

points
](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points)
, possible bonuses on
[
attack
rolls
](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll)
,
[
Defense
](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense)
, and
[
saving
throws
](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
(depending on the class and the new level), a new class feature (as defined by the class), and new skill points.

[
Skill
](modern-d20-srd-skills-index)
points are spent according to the class that the multiclass character just advanced in.
[
Skills
](modern-d20-srd-skills-index)
are purchased at the cost appropriate for that class.

     In general, a character can have levels in as many different classes as there are classes.
