## Skeleton (Template)

### Template Traits

Skeleton is an acquired template that can be added to any living corporeal creature that has a skeletal structure (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A skeleton uses all the base creatures statistics except as noted here.

Challenge Rating: A skeletons Challenge Rating depends on its size: Tiny or smaller 1/10, Small 1/6, Medium-size 1/3, Large 2, Huge 5, Gargantuan 9, Colossal 12.

Type: The creatures type changes to [undead](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-undead).

Hit Dice: Drop any Hit Dice gained from attaining levels, and raise the remaining Hit Dice to d12.

Speed: Winged skeletons cant use their wings to fly. If the base creature flew magically, so can the skeleton.

Defense: A skeletons natural armor bonus to Defense changes to a value based on its size: Tiny or smaller +0, Small +1, Medium-size +2, Large +3, Huge +4, Gargantuan +6, Colossal +10.

Attacks: A skeleton retains all the natural attacks, manufactured weapons, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature, except for attacks that cant work without flesh. A creature with hands gains one claw attack per hand; the skeleton can strike with all of them at its full attack bonus. (If the base creature already had claw attacks, it can use the skeleton claw attack and damage, if theyre better.)

Damage: Natural and manufactured weapons deal damage normally. A claw attack deals damage depending on the skeletons size (use the base creatures claw damage if its greater): Diminutive or Fine 1, Tiny 1d2, Small 1d3, Medium-size 1d4, Large 1d6, Huge 1d8, Gargantuan 2d6, Colossal 2d8.

Special Qualities: A skeleton loses all of the base creatures special qualities except for immunity or resistance to specific energy types. In addition to gaining the [undead](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-undead) type, a skeleton has the following special quality.

Skeleton Immunities (Ex): A skeleton has cold immunity. Because it lacks flesh and internal organs, a skeleton takes only half damage from ballistic, piercing, or slashing weapons.

Allegiances: A skeleton loses any previous allegiances and adopts a new allegiance to its creator. This allegiance cannot be broken.

[Saves](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): A skeletons saving throw modifiers are based on Hit Dice and given in [Table:
Creature Saves and Base Attack Bonuses](modern-d20-srd-creatures-creature-overview).

[Action Points](modern-d20-srd-basics-action-points): A skeleton does not acquire or amass action points. It loses any action points possessed by the base creature.

[Reputation Bonus](modern-d20-srd-reputation-index): A skeleton has a +0 Reputation bonus.

[Ability Scores](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores): A skeleton gains the following ability score increase: [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) +2. In addition, a skeleton has no [Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) or [Intelligence](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) score, its [Wisdom](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) changes to 10, and its [Charisma](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) changes to 1.

[Skills](modern-d20-srd-skills-index): A skeleton loses all skills.

[Feats](modern-d20-srd-feats-index): A skeleton loses all feats except those that confer armor or weapon proficiency ([Archaic
Weapons Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-archaic-weapons-proficiency), Armor Proficiency, [Exotic
Firearms Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-exotic-firearms-proficiency), [Exotic
