## Scale

These rules use two scales. If the encounter involves both [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) and characters on foot, use character scale. If the scene involves only [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles), and theyre likely to move at much higher [speeds](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed) than characters or creatures on foot, use chase scale.

Character Scale: Character scale is identical to the standard [movement
scale](modern-d20-srd-combat-movement-and-position): Its carried out on a grid in which each square equals 5 feet. In character scale, most [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) are large enough to occupy multiple squares on the map grid. How many squares a vehicle occupies is specified in the [vehicles description](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles).

When [moving](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-moving) a [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles), count the squares from the [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) rear. When turning, pivot the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) on the rear square toward which it is turning. When firing [weapons](modern-d20-srd-equipment-military-vehicles), count squares from the location of the [weapon](modern-d20-srd-equipment-military-vehicles).
In character scale, more than one ground [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) cannot occupy the same square.

Chase Scale: In chase scale, each square of the grid represents 50 feet.

In chase scale, most commonly encountered [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) occupy only one square. (Some especially large [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles), such as [ships](modern-d20-srd-equipment-civilian-water-vehicles) or [jumbo
jets](modern-d20-srd-equipment-civilian-aircraft), might occupy more than one square.) More than one [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) can occupy the same square. [Vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) in the same square are considered to be 20 feet apart for the purposes of determining [range
for attacks](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions).
