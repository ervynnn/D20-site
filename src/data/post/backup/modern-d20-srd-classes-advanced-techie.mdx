### Class Features

The following features pertain to the Techie advanced class.

### Jury-Rig

A Techie gains a +2 competence bonus on [Repair](modern-d20-srd-skills-repair) [skill checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) made to attempt temporary or jury-rigged repairs. See the [Repair
skill](modern-d20-srd-skills-repair) for details on jury-rigging.
At 7th level, this competence bonus increases to +4.

### Extreme Machine

| +2 to maneuver             | 30  | 0175 |

If it has mechanical or electronic components, a Techie of 2nd level or higher can get maximum performance out of it.

By spending 1 [action point](modern-d20-srd-basics-action-points) and making either a [Craft
(electronic)](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft-electronic) or [Craft
(mechanical)](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft-mechanical) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (whichever is appropriate for the machine in question), the Techie can temporarily improve a machines performanceat the risk of causing the machine to need repairs later. The DC for the [Craft](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) depends on the type of improvement being made, as shown on the table below.

The Techie performs the extreme modifications in 1 hour. The Techie cant [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) or [take 20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index) on this [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).
If the check succeeds, the effect of the improvement lasts for a number of
minutes equal to his or her Techie class level, beginning when the object is
first put into use. The Techie selects the single improvement he or she wants
to make prior to making the check. After the duration of the effect ends, the
machine reverts to its previous state and a repair chance percentile roll is
made. The result of this roll indicates whether the machine requires repairs
before it can be used again.

### Bonus Feats

At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Techie gets a bonus [feat](modern-d20-srd-feats-index). The bonus [feat](modern-d20-srd-feats-index) must be selected from the following list, and the Techie must meet all the prerequisites of the [feat](modern-d20-srd-feats-index) to select it.

[Builder](modern-d20-srd-feats-builder), [Cautious](modern-d20-srd-feats-cautious), [Combat
Expertise](modern-d20-srd-feats-combat-expertise), [Educated](modern-d20-srd-feats-educated), [Gearhead](modern-d20-srd-feats-gearhead), [Personal
Firearms Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-personal-firearms-proficiency), [Point
Blank Shot](modern-d20-srd-feats-point-blank-shot), [Studious](modern-d20-srd-feats-studious).

### Build Robot

A Techie of 4th level or higher can build remote-controlled [robots](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) that are Tiny or Diminutive in size. These [robots](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) serve as the Techies eyes, ears, or hands out to a predetermined distance away from the character when the Techie wants to use one of the following skills: [Computer
Use](modern-d20-srd-skills-computer-use), [Demolitions](modern-d20-srd-skills-demolitions), [Disable
Device](modern-d20-srd-skills-disable-device), [Listen](modern-d20-srd-skills-listen), [Repair](modern-d20-srd-skills-repair), or [Spot](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot).

The Techie must have at least 1 rank in the skill that he wants to program into the [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot). The Techie can only control one [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) at a time, and only one of his [robots](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) can be active at any time.

Follow these steps to build a [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot).

[Wealth Check](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check): The purchase DC for the components needed to construct a [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) is based on the [robots](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) size.

| Size       | Purchase DC |
| :--------- | ----------: |
| Diminutive |          18 |
| Tiny       |          15 |

Make the [Wealth check](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check) to purchase and gather the necessary components prior to starting construction.

Construct Frame: The [robots](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) body determines its size, shape, locomotion, and hit points. The DC of the [Craft
(mechanical)](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft-mechanical) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) is set by the [robots](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) size and modified by the form of locomotion selected.

| Size       | Craft DC |
| :--------- | -------: |
| Diminutive |       15 |
| Tiny       |       12 |

### Components

2 Select one or more of the options in this category.
3 Necessary for a robot built to use any skill except Listen or Spot. | |

Select a frame size and form, add manipulators and sensors as necessary, and choose a type of remote control link. Add all the modifiers to determine the checks DC. Make the [Craft
(mechanical)](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft-mechanical) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) to construct the [robots](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) frame.

It takes a Techie 30 hours to construct a Diminutive [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) frame or 12 hours to construct a Tiny [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) frame.

A Diminutive [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) can be 6 to 12 inches long or tall and weighs about 1 pound. A Tiny [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) can be 13 to 24 inches long or tall and weighs up to 3 pounds. Statistics for these [robots](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) can be found in the [Creature](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) listings.

Construct the Electronics: The next step is to build the internal electronics for the [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) and install them in the frame. The DC is based on the size of the [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) and modified by the number of components that need to be wired together. For a Diminutive robot, the DC is 20. For a Tiny [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot), the DC is 15. Add +1 to the DC for each external component and +2 for the remote link. Make the [Craft
(electronic)](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft-electronic) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

It takes a Techie 12 hours to wire a Diminutive [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) or 6 hours to wire a Tiny [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot).

Program the Robot: The Techie programs the [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) as the final step. Decide how many ranks of the appropriate skill to program into the [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot), up to the number of ranks the Techie has in the skill. A Techies [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) can only contain programming for one skill. Make the [Computer
Use](modern-d20-srd-skills-computer-use) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) to program the [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot).

The DC for the [Computer
Use](modern-d20-srd-skills-computer-use) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) is 20, modified by the number of ranks the Techie wants to program into the robot (+1 to the DC for each rank). It takes 1 hour to program the [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot).

Reprogramming: A [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) can be reprogrammed at any time. Doing this requires 1 hour of work and a [Computer
Use](modern-d20-srd-skills-computer-use) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 20 + the number of ranks programmed into the [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot)).

### Mastercraft

At 5th level, the Techie becomes adept at creating [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) objects. He of she applies the [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) ability to one of his or her [Craft](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft) skills ([electronic](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft-electronic) or [mechanical](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft-mechanical)). From this point on, he or she can build [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) objects using that skill.

With [Craft](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft) ([electronic](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft-electronic)), the Techie can build electronic devices. With [Craft](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft) ([mechanical](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft-mechanical)), the Techie can build mechanical devices, including weapons.

On average, it takes twice as long to build a [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) object as it does to build an ordinary object of the same type. The cost to build a [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) object is equal to the purchase DC for the components (see the appropriate [Craft](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft) skill description) + the bonus provided by the [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) feature. A Techie can add the [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) feature to an existing ordinary object by making the [Wealth
check](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check) and then making the [Craft](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) as though he or she were constructing the object from scratch.

In addition to the [Wealth
check](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check), the Techie must also pay a cost in experience points equal to 25 x his or her Techie level x the bonus provided by the [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) feature. The XP must be paid before making the [Craft](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). If the expenditure of these XP would drop the Techie to below the minimum needed for his or her current level, then the XP cant be paid and the Techie cant use the [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) ability until he or she gains enough additional XP to remain at his or her current level after the expenditure is made.

When successfully completed, a [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) object provides a +1 bonus to its quality compared to an ordinary object of the same type. All weapons and armor, and certain other types of equipment, such as computers and electronic devices, can be constructed as [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) objects.

At 8th level, the Techie can add the [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) ability to another [Craft](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft) skill, or he or she can improve his or her ability in the skill selected at 5th level, so that his or her [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) objects provide a +2 bonus.

At 10th level, the Techie adds another +1 bonus to his or her [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) ability. If the Techie focuses his or her ability on one [Craft](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft) skill, his or her [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) objects now provide a +3 bonus. If the Techie already has the ability for both [Craft](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft) skills, he or she chooses which one to improve to a +2 bonus.

The [Craft](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft) DC for a [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) object is the same as for a normal object of the same type, as described in the [Craft](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft) skill, with the following modification: For a +1 object, add +3 to the [Craft](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft) DC; for a +2 object, add +5 to the [Craft](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft) DC; and for a +3 object, add +10 to the [Craft](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft) DC.
