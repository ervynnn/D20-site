## Spot (Wis)

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): The Spot skill is used to notice items that arent immediately obvious and people who are attempting to hide. The GM may call for a Spot [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) by a character who is in a position to notice something. A character can also make a Spot [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) voluntarily if he or she wants to try to notice something in his or her vicinity.

The GM may make the Spot [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) in secret so that the character doesnt know whether not noticing anything means that nothing is there or that the character failed the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

A successful Spot [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) when there isnt anything to notice results in the character noticing nothing.

Spot is often used to notice a person or creature hiding from view. In such cases, the characters Spot [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) is opposed by the [Hide](modern-d20-srd-skills-hide) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) of the character trying not to be seen. Spot is also used to detect someone in disguise (see the [Disguise](modern-d20-srd-skills-disguise) skill), or to notice a concealed weapon on another person.

A characters Spot [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) is modified by a 1 penalty for every 10 feet of distance between the character and the character or object he or she is trying to discern. The [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) carries a further 5 penalty if the character is in the midst of activity.

Try Again?: A character can make a Spot [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) every time he or she has the opportunity to notice something in a reactive manner. As a [full-round
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions), a character may attempt to notice something that he or she failed (or believe he or she failed) to notice previously.

Special: A character can [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) or [take 20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index) when making a Spot [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

A character with the [Alertness](modern-d20-srd-feats-alertness) feat gets a +2 bonus on all Spot [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

Time: A Spot [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) is either a reaction (if called for by the GM) or a [full-round
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions) (if a character actively takes the time to try to notice something).
