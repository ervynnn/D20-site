## Bestow Curse

Necromancy

[Level](modern-d20-srd-fx-level): [Acolyte](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-acolyte) 3, [Mage](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-mage) 4; [Components](modern-d20-srd-fx-components): V, S; [Casting Time](modern-d20-srd-fx-casting-time); [Attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) [Range](modern-d20-srd-fx-range): Touch; [Target](modern-d20-srd-fx-target): Creature touched; [Duration](modern-d20-srd-fx-duration): Permanent; [Saving Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): Will negates; [Spell Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance): Yes

The caster places a curse on the creature touched. The caster chooses one of the three following effects, depending on the version selected:

6 penalty to an [ability
score](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) (minimum score of 1).

4 penalty on attack rolls, [saving
throws](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws), [ability checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics), and [skill
checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

Each turn, the target has a 50% chance to act normally; otherwise, he or she takes no action.

A character may also invent his or her own curse, but it should be no more powerful than those described above, and the GM has final say on the curses effect.

The curse cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a [break
enchantment](modern-d20-srd-fx-break-enchantment) or [remove curse](modern-d20-srd-fx-remove-curse) spell.

Bestow curse counters [remove curse](modern-d20-srd-fx-remove-curse).
