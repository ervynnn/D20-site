     The manifester forges a telepathic bond with another person or creature, which must have an
     [
      Intelligence
     ](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)
     score of 6 or higher. The bond can be established only with a willing subject, who therefore receives no saving throw and gains no benefit from power resistance. The manifester can communicate telepathically through the bond even if he or she does not share a common language with the subject. No special power or influence is established as a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance.
