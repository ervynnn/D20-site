## Movement and Position

When using a grid to represent characters movement, the standard scale equates 1 inch (or a 1 inch square) to 5 feet in the game world.

|                    Standard Scale |
| --------------------------------: |
| One inch (or one square) = 5 feet |

| Next to or adjacent = 1 inch (5 feet) away
(or in adjacent square) |
| 30mm figure = A human-size creature |
| A human-size creature occupies an area 1 inch (5 feet) across (or one square) |
| One round = 6 seconds |

### Tactical Movement

Where can a character move, how long it takes to get there, and whether he or she is vulnerable to attacks of opportunity while moving are key questions in combat.

### How Far Can a Character Move?

Humans normally move 30 feet, although armor can slow a character down. Some creatures move faster or slower. A characters speed when unarmored is sometimes called base speed.

Encumbrance: A character encumbered by carrying a large amount of gear or a fallen comrade may move slower than normal.

Movement in Combat: Generally, a character can move his or her speed as a move action. If a character uses his or her attack action as a move action, the character can move again (for a total movement of up to twice the characters normal speed). If the character spends the entire round to run all out, he or she can move up to four times his or her normal speed. If a character does something that requires a full round, he or she can only take a 5-foot step.

Movement in Darkness: If a character moves when he or she cant see, such as in total darkness, his or her speed is limited to one-half normal. The Blind-Fight feat reduces this penalty.

### Passing Through

Sometimes a character can pass through an area occupied by another character or creature.

Friendly Character: A character can move through a square occupied by a friendly character.

Unfriendly Character: There are two ways to move through a square occupied by a resisting enemy. The character can attempt an overrun. Or the character can attempt to tumble through a square occupied by an enemy (if the character has ranks in the Tumble skill; see the skill description).

A character can move through a square occupied by an unfriendly character who doesnt resist as if the character was friendly.

Square Occupied by Creature Three Sizes Larger or Smaller: Any creature can move through a square occupied by a creature three size categories larger or three categories smaller than it is.

### Flanking

If a character is making a melee attack against an opponent, and an ally directly opposite the character is threatening the opponent, the character and his or her ally flank the opponent. The character gains a +2 bonus on his or her attack roll. The ally must be on the other side of the opponent so that the opponent is directly between the character and the ally.

A character doesnt gain a bonus for flanking when making a ranged attack.
