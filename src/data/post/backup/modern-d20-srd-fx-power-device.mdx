    This spell provides power to an electrical or mechanical device that does not have a power source but is otherwise functional.  The device functions exactly as it normally would if it had conventional power.




    This spell can affect any household or handheld device, scratch-built robot, or general-purpose vehicle. Larger or more intricate devices cannot be powered with this spell.
