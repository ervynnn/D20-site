## Replacement (Template)

A replacement is a physical duplicate of a specific [humanoid](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-humanoid), called a primary. Although a replacement does not gain the specific life experiences of its primary, it can easily mimic the demeanor and general behavior of the primary, enabling it to fill the same general role as the primary. A replacement is identical in appearance to the primary except it has jet-black eyes with no visible irises. Some replacements wear special contact lenses (purchase DC 12) to conceal this sinister physical divergence.

Replacements are bred in laboratories. A sample of the primarys subdermal tissue is required to create a replacement (dead skin cells or hair follicles will not do), and an adult replacement takes two months to grow. Creating a replacement requires a successful [Craft
(pharmaceutical)](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft) check (DC 50). The check must be made 1 month into the replacements growth period, and a failed roll indicates the premature death of the replacement. Financing the growth and development of a replacement also requires a successful [Wealth
check](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check) against a purchase DC of 48, rolled before the process of growing the clone commences.

### Template Traits

Replacement is an inherited template that can be added to any [humanoid](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-humanoid) (referred to hereafter as the original). A replacement uses all the primarys statistics except as noted here.

Challenge Rating: Same as the original 1.

Hit Dice: Change to one die type smaller than the primary.

Special Qualities: A replacement gains all of the originals extraordinary abilities but none of its supernatural or spell-like abilities (including psionics). A replacement gains none of the originals other special qualities or talents. A replacement knows that it lacks some of the abilities of the original and occasionally feels resentful toward the original for this reason.

In addition to its inherited extraordinary abilities, a replacement has the following special quality:

Limited Existence (Ex): A replacement has a programmed natural life span of one to four years (the creator must specify the life span when the project to create the replacement begins). Once the replacement reaches the end of its programmed life span, it must make a [Fortitude
save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) (DC 25) once per day. Each failed save drains the replacement of 1d6 points of [Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores). This ability drain cannot be restored by any means. When its [Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) drops to 0, the replacement dissolves into a mass of protoplasmic goo. A replacement that dies before this time retains the shape of the original.

Allegiances: A replacements primary allegiance is to its creator or owner. This allegiance cannot be broken unless the creator or owner does something to break it (such as by attacking the replacement).

Saves: As the original, modified by altered ability scores (see Abilities, below).

Action Points: Replacements do not acquire or amass action points.

Abilities: As the original, except ability scores cannot exceed 12. Ability scores of 13 or higher for the original are reduced to 12 for the replacement. A replacement that gains levels can never raise an ability score above 12.

[Skills](modern-d20-srd-skills-index): A replacement has access to any skill in which the original has ranks, and all of a replacements skills are class skills even if they are cross-class skills for the original. A replacement gets a number of skill points per Hit Die equal to 4 + the replacements Intelligence modifier (minimum 1 skill point per Hit Die). The replacement can never have more ranks in a skill than the original.

The replacement gains a +4 species bonus on [Disguise](modern-d20-srd-skills-disguise) checks when impersonating the original. The bonus increases to +10 if the replacement wears contact lenses that hide its distinctive black eyes.

[Feats](modern-d20-srd-feats-index): A replacement gains the originals feats but cannot use any feat for which it no longer meets the prerequisites.

Automatic Languages: A replacement can [read](modern-d20-srd-skills-read-write-language), [write](modern-d20-srd-skills-read-write-language), and [speak](modern-d20-srd-skills-speak-language) any language known by the original.

Advancement: By character class.
