     Grabbing Objects




     A character can also use
     [
      disarm
     ](modern-d20-srd-combat-disarm)
     to

snatch away an object worn by a target. Doing this works the same as a
[
disarm
](modern-d20-srd-combat-disarm)
attempt,
except for the following.

[
Attack of Opportunity
](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity)
: If the targets
[
attack
of opportunity
](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity)
inflicts any
[
damage
](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
, the attempt to grab the object automatically fails.

     Modifiers: If the object is well secured or otherwise difficult to grab from the target, the target gets a +4 bonus. On the other hand, if the object is poorly secured or otherwise easy to snatch or cut away, the attacker gets a +4 bonus.




     Failed Attempts: Failing an attempt to grab an object doesnt allow the target to attempt to
     [
      disarm
     ](modern-d20-srd-combat-disarm)
     the character.
