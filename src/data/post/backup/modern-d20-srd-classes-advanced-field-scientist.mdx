### Class Features

The following features pertain to the Field Scientist advanced class.

### Smart Defense

A Field Scientist applies his or her [Intelligence](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) bonus and his or her [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) bonus to his or her [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense). Any situation that would deny the Field Scientist his or her [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) bonus to [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) also denies the [Intelligence](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) bonus.

### Scientific Improvisation

At 2nd level, a Field Scientist gains the ability to improvise solutions using common objects and scientific know-how. This ability lets the Field Scientist create objects in a dramatic situation quickly and cheaply, but that have a limited duration.

By spending 1 [action point](modern-d20-srd-basics-action-points) and combining common objects with a [Craft](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-basics-index) that corresponds to the function desired, the Field Scientist can build a tool or device to deal with any situation. The DC for the [Craft](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-basics-index) is equal to 5 + the purchase DC of the object that most closely matches the desired function.
Only objects that can normally be used more than once can be improvised.

Electronic devices, special tools, weapons, mechanical devices, and more can be built with scientific improvisation. It takes a [full-round](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions) action to make an object with scientific improvisation. The object, when put into use, lasts for a number of rounds equal to the Field Scientists class level, or until the end of the current encounter, before it breaks down. It cant be repaired.

### Bonus Feats

At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Field Scientist gets a bonus [feat](modern-d20-srd-feats-index). The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Field Scientist must meet all the prerequisites of the feat to select it.

[Archaic Weapons
Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-archaic-weapons-proficiency), [Attentive](modern-d20-srd-feats-attentive), [Cautious](modern-d20-srd-feats-cautious), [Combat
Expertise](modern-d20-srd-feats-combat-expertise), [Educated](modern-d20-srd-feats-educated), [Gearhead](modern-d20-srd-feats-gearhead), [Personal
Firearms Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-personal-firearms-proficiency), [Point
Blank Shot](modern-d20-srd-feats-point-blank-shot), [Renown](modern-d20-srd-feats-renown), [Studious](modern-d20-srd-feats-studious).

### Skill Mastery

At 4th level, a Field Scientist selects a number of skills from his or her class list equal to 3 + his or her [Intelligence](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier. When making a [skill check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) using one of these skills, the Field Scientist may [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) even if stress and distractions would normally prevent him or her from doing so.

### Minor Breakthrough

Upon attaining 5th level, a Field Scientist receives credit for a minor scientific breakthrough that earns him or her the recognition of her peers. The Field Scientist chooses one of the following [Knowledge](modern-d20-srd-skills-knowledge) skills: behavioral sciences, earth and life sciences, physical sciences, or technology. When dealing with others with at least 1 rank in the same [Knowledge](modern-d20-srd-skills-knowledge) skill, the Field Scientist gains a +2 bonus on [Reputation](modern-d20-srd-reputation-index) checks.

This minor breakthrough also provides the Field Scientist with a +3 [Wealth
bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus) increase.

### Smart Survival

A Field Scientist of 7th level or higher can spend 1 [action
point](modern-d20-srd-basics-action-points) to reduce the [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) dealt by a single [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) or effect by 5 points.

### Smart Weapon

At 8th level, the Field Scientist selects one weapon that he or she is proficient in and can use with one hand. With the selected weapon, the Field Scientist can use his or her [Intelligence](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier instead of [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) or [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier on [attack
rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll).

### Major Breakthrough

At 10th level, the Field Scientist gains a +2 bonus on [Reputation](modern-d20-srd-reputation-index) checks when dealing with individuals who have at least 1 rank in any of the following [Knowledge](modern-d20-srd-skills-knowledge) skills: behavioral sciences, earth and life sciences, physical sciences, or technology. This bonus stacks with the bonus provided by the minor breakthrough ability.

This major breakthrough also provides the Field Scientist with a +3 [Wealth
bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus) increase.
