## Perform (Cha)

This skill encompasses several categories, each of them treated as a separate skill. These categories are identified and defined below.

The number of Perform categories is kept purposely finite. When trying to determine what Perform skill a particular type of performance falls under, use a broad interpretation of the existing categories. Do not arbitrarily make up new categories.

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): The character is accomplished in some type of artistic expression and knows how to put on a performance. The character can impress audiences with his or her talent and skill. The quality of the characters performance depends on his or her [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) result.

The eight Perform categories, and the qualities each one encompasses, are as follows.

Act: The character is a gifted actor, capable of performing drama, comedy, or action-oriented roles with some level of skill.

Dance: The character is a gifted dancer, capable of performing rhythmic and patterned bodily movements to music.

Keyboards: The character is a musician gifted with a talent for playing keyboard musical instruments, such as piano, organ, and synthesizer.

Percussion Instruments: The character is a musician gifted with a talent for playing percussion musical instruments, such as drums, cymbals, triangle, xylophone, and tambourine.

Sing: The character is a musician gifted with a talent for producing musical tones with your voice.

Stand-Up: The character is a gifted comedian, capable of performing a stand-up routine before an audience.

Stringed [Instruments](modern-d20-srd-equipment-professional-equipment): The character is a musician gifted with a talent for playing stringed musical instruments, such as banjo, guitar, harp, lute, sitar, and violin.

| :----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| 10     | Amateur performance. Audience may appreciate your performance, but isnt impressed. |

| 20     |                                      Great performance. Audience highly impressed. |

Try Again?: Not for the same performance and audience.

Special: A character can [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) when making a Perform check, but cant [take
20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index).

A character without an appropriate [instrument](modern-d20-srd-equipment-professional-equipment) automatically fails any Perform (keyboard), Perform (percussion), Perform (stringed), or Perform (wind) check he or she attempts. At the GMs discretion, impromptu instruments may be employed, but the performer must take a 4 penalty on the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) because his or her equipment, although usable, is inappropriate for the skill.

Every time a character takes the [Creative](modern-d20-srd-feats-creative) feat, he or she gets a +2 bonus on checks involving two Perform skills the character designates. See the [feat
description](modern-d20-srd-feats-creative) for more information.

Time: A Perform [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) usually requires at least several minutes to an hour or more.
