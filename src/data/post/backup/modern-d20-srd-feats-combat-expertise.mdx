## Combat Expertise

Prerequisite: [Intelligence](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) 13.

Benefit: When the character uses the [attack
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) or the [full
attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions) in melee, the character can take a penalty of up to 5 on his or her [attack
roll](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) and add the same number (up to +5) to the characters [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense). This number may not exceed the characters base attack bonus. The changes to [attack
rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) and [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) last until the characters next action. The bonus to the characters [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) is a dodge bonus (and as such it stacks with other dodge bonuses the character may have).

Normal: A character without the Combat Expertise feat can fight defensively while using the [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) or [full
attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions) to take a 4 penalty on [attacks](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) and gain a +2 dodge bonus to [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense).
