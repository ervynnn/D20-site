## Vehicle Dodge

Prerequisites: [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) 13, [Drive](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive) 6 ranks or [Pilot](modern-d20-srd-skills-pilot) 6 ranks, [Vehicle
Expert](modern-d20-srd-feats-vehicle-expert).

Benefit: When driving a vehicle, during the characters action the character designates an opposing vehicle or a single opponent.

The character can select a new vehicle or opponent on any action.
