## Displacement

Illusion

[Level](modern-d20-srd-fx-level): [Mage](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-mage) 3; [Components](modern-d20-srd-fx-components): V, M; [Casting Time](modern-d20-srd-fx-casting-time); [Attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) [Range](modern-d20-srd-fx-range): Touch; [Target](modern-d20-srd-fx-target): Creature touched; [Duration](modern-d20-srd-fx-duration): 1 round/level (D); [Saving Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): Will negates (harmless); [Spell Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance): Yes (harmless)

The subject appears to be about 2 feet away from his or her true location. The subject benefits from a 50% miss chance as if he or she had total concealment. However, unlike actual total [concealment](modern-d20-srd-combat-concealment), displacement does not prevent enemies from targeting the subject normally. True seeing reveals the subjectÂ’s true location.

Material Component: Purchase DC 9.
