## Attack Options

Firing a [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)s [weapon](modern-d20-srd-equipment-military-vehicles) requires an [attack
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) and uses the drivers or gunners [ranged
attack modifier](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-bonus).
A driver with 5 or more ranks in the [Drive](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive) skill gains a +2 synergy bonus when firing [vehicle-mounted
weapons](modern-d20-srd-equipment-military-vehicles) while driving.

Some [military vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-military-vehicles) are equipped with fire-control computers. These systems grant equipment [bonuses](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-bonus) on [attack
rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) with the [vehicle-mounted
weapons](modern-d20-srd-equipment-military-vehicles) to which they apply.

Driving Defensively: Just as in [melee
combat](modern-d20-srd-combat-index), one can fight defensively while driving a [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles),
which grants a +2 [dodge
bonus](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) to the vehicles [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) and
applies a 4 penalty on [attack
rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) made by occupants of the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-military-vehicles).
Total Defense: A driver can choose the total defense action which grants a +4
[dodge bonus](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) to [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) but does not allow the driver to attack (gunners or
passengers take a 8 penalty on [attack
rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll)). These modifiers last until
the drivers next round of actions.

Full Attack Action: A driver cannot normally make a [full
attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions), since controlling the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-military-vehicles) requires a [move
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions).

Gunners or passengers, however, can take [full
attack actions](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions), since they dont have to use a [move
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions) (except, perhaps, to change positions in the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)). In general, taking a [full
attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions) is useful only if a character has a base [attack
bonus](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-bonus) high enough to get multiple attacks. A passenger can make [multiple
attacks](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions) with his or her own [weapon](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-weapons). A gunner can make [multiple
attacks](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions) with one or more [weapons](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-weapons) controlled from his or her position.
