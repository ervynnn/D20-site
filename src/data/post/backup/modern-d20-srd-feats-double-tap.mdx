## Double Tap

Prerequisites: [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) 13, [Point
Blank Shot](modern-d20-srd-feats-point-blank-shot).

Benefit: When using a semiautomatic firearm with at least two bullets loaded, the character may fire two bullets as a single attack against a single target. The character receives a Â–2 penalty on this [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll), but deals +1 die of [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) with a successful hit. Using this feat fires two bullets and can only be done if the weapon has two bullets in it.
