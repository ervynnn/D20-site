## Dodge

Prerequisite: [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) 13.

Benefit: During the characterÂ’s action, the character designates an opponent and receives a +1 dodge bonus to [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) against any subsequent [attacks](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) from that opponent. The character can select a new opponent on any action.

Special: A condition that makes the character lose his or her [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) bonus to [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) also makes the character lose dodge bonuses. Also, dodge bonuses stack with each other, unlike most other types of bonuses.
