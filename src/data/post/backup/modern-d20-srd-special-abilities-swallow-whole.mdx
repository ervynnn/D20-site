## Swallow Whole (Ex)

If the creature begins its turn with an opponent held in its mouth (see [improved
grab](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-improved-grab)), it can attempt a new [grapple
check](modern-d20-srd-combat-grapple) (as though attempting to pin the
opponent). If it succeeds, it swallows its opponent and deals bite [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage).
Unless noted otherwise, the opponent can be up to one size category smaller
than the swallowing creature.

Being swallowed has various consequences depending on the creature, but a swallowed opponent is considered [grappled](modern-d20-srd-combat-grapple), while the creature is not. A swallowed opponent can try to cut its way free with any light piercing or slashing [weapon](modern-d20-srd-equipment-weapons-melee) (the amount of cutting damage required to get free is noted in the creatures descriptive text), or it can just try to escape the [grapple](modern-d20-srd-combat-grapple). If the swallowed opponent chooses the latter course, success puts it back in the creatures mouth, where it may be bitten or swallowed again.
