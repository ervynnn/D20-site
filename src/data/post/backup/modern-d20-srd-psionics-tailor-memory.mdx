## Tailor Memory

[Charisma](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) [Mind-Affecting]

Level: [Telepath](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-telepath) 4; Display: Audible; Manifestation Time: [Attack
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions); Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level); Target: One target of Medium-size or smaller; Duration: Instantaneous; [Saving
Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): Will negates (see text); [Power
Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-power-resistance): Yes; Power Point Cost: 7

The manifester inserts a memory of his or her own choosing in the targets mind. The manifester can insert a memory of up to 1 round duration per four manifester levels. The manifester chooses when the fake event occurred any time within the last week. The manifester cant read the targets memory with this power.

Tailoring a memory is tricky, because if it is not done right the targets mind recognizes it as false. Dissonance occurs if a manifester inserts a memory that is out of context with the targets past experience. The target gains a bonus of +1 to +4 on his or her [saving
throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws), depending on the magnitude of dissonance create by an out-of-context memory, as determined by the GM. Likewise, inserting a memory of the target taking an action against his or her nature grants a +1 to +4 bonus, depending on the type of memory inserted. Inserting a memory that couldnt possibly be true causes the power to fail automatically.
