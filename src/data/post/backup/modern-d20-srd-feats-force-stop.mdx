## Force Stop

Prerequisites: [Drive](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive) 4 ranks, [Vehicle
Expert](modern-d20-srd-feats-vehicle-expert).

Benefit: When the character attempts a sideswipe [stunt](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-stunts) with a [surface
vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles), the character can force the other vehicle to a stop by nudging it into a controlled side­ways skid. In addition to the normal requirements for attempting a sideswipe [stunt](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-stunts), the character must have sufficient movement remaining to move a number of squares equal to the characters turn number.

After succeeding on the check to attempt the sideswipe, the character makes a [Drive](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) opposed by the other driver. If the character succeeds, turn the other vehicle 90 degrees across the front of the characters, so that they form a tee. Move them forward a distance equal to the characters turn number. The vehicles end their movement at that location, at stationary speed, and take their normal [sideswipe
damage](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-resolving-collisions).

If the character fails the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), resolve the sideswipe normally.
