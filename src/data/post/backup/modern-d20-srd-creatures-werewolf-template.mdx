## Werewolf (Template)

Natural werewolves are humanoids born with the ability to assume wolf and hybrid forms. A [humanoid](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-humanoid) who contracts lycanthropy after being wounded by a werewolf becomes an afflicted werewolf.

### Template Traits

Werewolf is a template (inherited for natural werewolves, acquired for afflicted werewolves) that can be added to any [humanoid](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-humanoid) creature (referred to hereafter as the character).

A werewolf uses either the characters or the wolfs statistics and special abilities in addition to those described below.

Challenge Rating: Same as the character +2.

Hit Dice: Same as the character plus the wolfs Hit Dice (2d8).

Speed: Same as the character, or 50 feet for hybrid and wolf form.

Defense: Same as the character while in [humanoid](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-humanoid) form. In hybrid and animal form, the creature gains a +2 natural armor bonus. This bonus does not stack with other natural armor bonuses.

Base Attack: Same as the character +1.

Grapple Bonus: Apply modifiers for [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) depending on the lycanthropes form.

Attacks: Same as the character while in [humanoid](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-humanoid) form. In hybrid and animal form, a werewolf attacks with its powerful bite, dealing 1d6 points of [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) plus its [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier.

Special Qualities: A werewolf retains all the special qualities of the character and gains the additional special qualities listed below.

Alternate Form (Su): A werewolf can assume wolf or hybrid form, but its gear is not absorbed into the new form. The bipedal hybrid form is about 6 feet tall, with a short tail and thick fur. The legs are like those of a wolf, and the head combines [humanoid](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-humanoid) and lupine features in degrees that vary from one werewolf to the next. The animal form is that of a fully-grown wolf without any trace of human features.

Changing to or from wolf or hybrid form is a [move
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions). Upon assuming either form, the werewolf regains [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points) as if having rested for a day. A slain werewolf reverts to its [humanoid](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-humanoid) form, although it remains dead. Afflicted werewolves find this ability difficult to control (see Lycanthropy as an Affliction, below), but natural lycanthropes have full control over this power.

Curse of Lycanthropy (Su): Any [humanoid](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-humanoid) hit by a werewolfs bite [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) (in wolf or hybrid form) must succeed on a [Fortitude
save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) (DC 15) or contract lycanthropy.

[Trip](modern-d20-srd-combat-trip) (Ex): A werewolf in wolf form that hits with a bite [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) can attempt to [trip](modern-d20-srd-combat-trip) its opponent as a [free
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types) without making a touch attack or provoking an [attack
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity). If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to [trip](modern-d20-srd-combat-trip) the werewolf.

[Scent](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-scent) (Ex): This ability allows a werewolf in wolf or hybrid form to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

[Damage Reduction](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-damage-reduction) 15/Silver (Su): A werewolf in wolf or hybrid form ignores the first 15 points of [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) dealt by a nonsilver or nonmagical weapon but takes full damage from silvered weapons or weapons with a +1 or better magic bonus.

Wolf Empathy (Ex): A werewolf can communicate with wolves in any form and gains a +4 species bonus on [Diplomacy](modern-d20-srd-skills-diplomacy) checks when influencing a wolfs attitude. A friendly wolf understands and heeds simple commands, such as wait, chase, flee, and attack.

[Darkvision](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-darkvision) (Ex): In their wolf and hybrid forms, werewolves have [darkvision](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-darkvision) with a range of 60 feet.

Saves: Same as the character, with a +3 bonus on Fortitude and Reflex saves.

[Ability Scores](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores): Werewolves gain the following [ability
score](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) increases: [Con](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) +4, [Wis](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) +2. Additionally, a werewolf that assumes wolf and hybrid form gains the following additional benefits for as long as it remains in either form: [Str](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) +2, [Dex](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) +4.

[Allegiances](modern-d20-srd-basics-allegiances): A natural werewolf typically has allegiance to chaos and evil. An afflicted werewolf gains the chaos and evil [allegiances](modern-d20-srd-basics-allegiances) (displacing other [allegiances](modern-d20-srd-basics-allegiances), if need be). These [allegiances](modern-d20-srd-basics-allegiances) can be removed only when the werewolf has the ability to control the curse of lycanthropy by taking 10 on a Control Shape check.

[Skills](modern-d20-srd-skills-index): Same as the character, with a +1 species bonus on [Hide](modern-d20-srd-skills-hide) checks, a +2 species bonus on [Move Silently](modern-d20-srd-skills-move-silently) checks, a +3 species bonus on [Spot](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot) checks, and a +5 species bonus on [Listen](modern-d20-srd-skills-listen) checks. A werewolf in wolf or hybrid form also gains a +4 species bonus on [Survival](modern-d20-srd-skills-survival) checks when tracking by scent.

[Feats](modern-d20-srd-feats-index): Same as the character. A werewolf gains the bonus feats [Iron
Will](modern-d20-srd-feats-iron-will) and [Weapon Finesse](modern-d20-srd-feats-weapon-finesse) (bite).

Talents: Same as the character.

### Lycanthropy as an Affliction

When a character contracts lycanthropy through a werewolfs attack, no symptoms appear until the first night of the next full moon. On that night, the afflicted character involuntarily assumes animal form and becomes a ravenous beast, forgetting his or her own identity. The character remains in animal form until dawn and remembers nothing about the incident.

Thereafter, the character is subject to involuntary transformation under the full moon and whenever damaged in combat. He or she feels an overwhelming rage building up and must succeed on a Control Shape check to resist changing into animal form.

### Curing Lycanthropy

An afflicted character who eats a sprig of belladonna (also called wolfsbane) within an hour of a lycanthropes attack can attempt a [Fortitude
save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) (DC 20) to shake off the affliction. If someone with ranks in the [Treat
Injury](modern-d20-srd-skills-treat-injury) skill administers the herb, use the characters saving throw or the healers [Treat
Injury](modern-d20-srd-skills-treat-injury) check, whichever is higher. The character gets only one chance, no matter how much belladonna is consumed. The belladonna must be reasonably fresh (picked within the last week).

Fresh or not, belladonna is toxic. A character consuming the herb must succeed on a [Fortitude
save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) (DC 13) or take initial damage of 1d6 points of temporary [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores). One minute later, the character must succeed on a second [save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) (same DC) or take an additional 2d6 points of temporary [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) damage.

The only other way to remove the curse of lycanthropy is to cast [remove
curse](modern-d20-srd-fx-remove-curse) or [break
enchantment](modern-d20-srd-fx-break-enchantment) on the character during one of the three days of the full moon. After receiving the spell, the character must succeed on a [Will
save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) (DC 20) to break the curse (the caster knows whether the spell works). Otherwise, the process must be repeated. Characters undergoing this cure are often kept bound or confined in cages until the cure takes effect.

Only afflicted lycanthropes can be cured of lycanthropy. Natural lycanthropy cannot be cured.

### New Skill: Control Shape (Wis) Trained Only

| Return to [humanoid](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-humanoid) form (full moon 1)   |  25 |
| Return to [humanoid](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-humanoid) form (not full moon) |  20 |
| Voluntary change (full moon)                                                      |  10 |
| Voluntary change (not full moon)                                                  |  15 |
| 1 For game purposes, the full moon lasts three days every month.                  |     |

Any character who has contracted lycanthropy and is aware of his or her condition can learn Control Shape as a class skill. This determines whether the afflicted werewolf can voluntarily control his shape. Natural lycanthropes have control over their shapeshifting abilities.

Check: The afflicted character must make a check at moonrise each night of the full moon to resist involuntarily assuming animal form. An injured character must also check for an involuntary change after accumulating enough damage to reduce his or her hit point total to three-quarters of its full normal value and again after each additional one-quarter lost (save DC same as for full moon).

Try Again?: Check for an involuntary change once each time a triggering event occurs. On a failed check to return to [humanoid](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-humanoid) form (see below), the character must remain in animal or hybrid form until the next dawn, when he or she automatically returns to [humanoid](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-humanoid) form.

Special: A character can [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index), but cannot [take 20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index).

When returning to normal form after an involuntary change, the character attempts a Wisdom check (DC 15) to realize what has happened. If the check succeeds, the character becomes aware of the affliction and can now voluntarily attempt to change to animal or hybrid form, using the appropriate DC. An attempt is a standard action and can be made each round. Any voluntary change to animal or hybrid form immediately and permanently changes the characters two strongest allegiances to chaos and evil.

An afflicted character who is aware of his or her condition can also try to return to [humanoid](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-humanoid) from after assuming animal or hybrid form, using the appropriate DC. Only one attempt is allowed, however, as described above.

Time: Attempting to control ones shape is a full-round action.
