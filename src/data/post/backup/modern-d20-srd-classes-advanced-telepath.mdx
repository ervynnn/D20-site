    Psionic Skills

| Task            |         DC |
| :-------------- | ---------: |
| Resist fear     |         15 |
| Memorize        |         15 |
| Tolerate poison | Poisons DC |
| Willpower       |         20 |

    A Telepath has access to the following psionic skills. These skills are considered class skills for the Telepath, and he can use his skill points to buy ranks in them, just like other skills in the game.





     Autohypnosis

[
(Wis)
](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)
: Trained only. You have trained your mind to resist certain injuries and threats while also gaining a few select benefits.

    Check: The DC and effect depend on the task you attempt.





     Resist Fear

    : In response to a fear effect, you can make an Autohypnosis check on your next action even if youve been overcome by fear. A successful check grants you another
    [
     saving throw
    ](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
    with a +4 morale bonus to resist the fear effect.





     Memorize

    : You can attempt to memorize a long string of numbers, a long passage of verse, or other particularly difficult piece of information. Each successful check allows you to memorize up to 250 words or the equivalent of what could be comfortably contained on an 8 1/2-by-11-inch sheet of paper. You always retain this information; however, you can only recall it with a successful Autohypnosis check.





     Tolerate
     [
      Poison
     ](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-poison)

    : In response to being
    [
     poisoned
    ](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-poison)
    , you can make an Autohypnosis check on your next action. A successful check grants you a +4 morale bonus on your
    [
     saving throw
    ](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
    to resist the
    [
     poisons
    ](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-poison)
    secondary damage.





     Willpower

    : If reduced to 0
    [
     hit

points
](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points)
(
[
disabled
](modern-d20-srd-conditions-index)
), you may make an Autohypnosis check. If successful, you can perform a strenuous action without taking 1 point of
[
damage
](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
. A failed check carries no penaltiesyou can choose not to perform the strenuous action. If you do perform the strenuous action after failing the check, you take 1 point of
[
damage
](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
, as normal.

    Try Again?: For resist fear and memorize, you can make a check once per round. You cant try again to tolerate
    [
     poison
    ](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-poison)
    . You cant try again in the same round for willpower.




    Special: You can
    [
     take 10
    ](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index)
    on Autohypnosis checks, but you cant
    [
     take

20
](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index)
.

    Most uses of Autohypnosis are
    [
     attack

actions
](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions)
. Willpower is a
[
free
action
](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types)
that can be attempted once per round.

     Concentration

[
(Con)
](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)
: The normal Concentration skill expands to include psionic applications, as defined below.

    Check: You must make a Concentration check whenever you may potentially be distracted while engaged in an activity, including manifesting a power or concentrating on an active power, that requires your full attention.




    If the check succeeds, you may continue with the action as normal. If the check fails, the action automatically fails and is wasted. If you were in the process of manifesting a power, the power is lost. If you were concentrating on an active power, the power ends. The table in the Concentration skill description summarizes the various types of distractions. In situations where the distraction occurs while you are manifesting a power, you add the level of the power to the DC.




    Try Again?: You can try again, but doing so doesnt cancel the effects of a previous failure. If you lost a power, the power is lost.




    Special: By making a check (DC 15 + power level), you can use Concentration to manifest a power defensively, thus avoiding attacks of opportunity. If the check succeeds, you can attempt the action without incurring any attacks of opportunity.





     Psicraft

[
(Int)
](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)
: Trained only. Use this skill to identify
[
psionic
powers
](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index)
as they manifest or
[
psionic
](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index)
effects already in place.

    Check: You can identify
    [
     psionic powers
    ](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index)
    and effects.

| DC               |       Task |
| :--------------- | ---------: |
| 15 + power level | Identify a |

      [
       psionic power
      ](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index)
      as it manifests. (You must sense the powers display or see some visible effect to identify a power.) You cant try again. |

| 20 + power level | Identify a power thats already in place and in effect. (You must be able to see or detect the effects of the power.) You cant try again. |
| 20 + power level | Identify materials created or shaped by
[
psionics
](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index)
. You cant try again. |
| 30 or higher | Understand a strange or unique
[
psionic
](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index)
effect. You cant try again. |

    Try Again?: See above.

    The Telepaths main strength is his ability to manifest
    [
     psionic

powers
](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index)
.

    A
    [
     psionic power
    ](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index)
    is a one-time
    [
     psionic
    ](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index)
    effect.
    [
     Psionic

powers
](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index)
require power points to use. Unlike
[
arcane
spellcasters
](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-mage)
, Telepaths dont have spellbooks and they dont prepare powers ahead of time. In addition, a Telepath can use
[
psionics
](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index)
while wearing armor without risking the failure of the power.

    A Telepaths level limits the number of power points available for manifesting
    [
     powers
    ](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index)
    . In addition, a Telepath must have a key
    [
     ability

score
](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)
equal to at least 10 + the powers level to manifest a particular power.

    The Telepaths selection of powers is extremely limited, although he enjoys ultimate flexibility. At 1st level, a Telepath knows three 0-level
    [
     powers
    ](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index)
    of your choice and one 1st-level
    [
     power
    ](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index)
    . At each level, the Telepath discovers one or more previously latent
    [
     powers
    ](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index)
    , as indicated on the table below.




    The DC for
    [
     saving throws
    ](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
    to resist a
    [
     psionic
    power
    ](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index)
    is 10 + the powers level + the Telepaths key
    [
     ability

.

| Cha Score | Bonus Power Points per Day |
| :-------- | -------------------------: |
| 1213      |                          1 |
| 1415      |                          3 |
| 1617      |                          5 |
| 1819      |                          7 |
| 2021      |                          9 |
| 2223      |                         11 |

    A Telepath can manifest a certain number of
    [
     powers
    ](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index)
    per

day based on his available power points. (0-level powers have a special cost;
see
[
Psionic Basics
](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index)
.) He just pays the power point cost of a
[
power
](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index)
to manifest
it, no preparation necessary. The base number of power points available per
day
is shown on the table above. This number is improved by bonus points determined
by the Telepaths
[
Charisma
](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)
score,
as shown on the table below.

###

    Trigger Power




    At 2nd, 5th, and 8th level, the Telepath chooses one
    [
     psionic

power
](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index)
that he can attempt to manifest for no power point cost.

    At each of these levels, you select one 0-, 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level power you can use. From that point on, you can attempt to trigger that power without paying its cost. To trigger a power, you must have enough power points to cover the normal cost of the power manifestation. Then, make an
    [
     ability

check
](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)
appropriate to the power.

    If you succeed at the
    [
     ability

check
](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)
, the power manifests with no cost in power points. If the check fails, you pay the power point cost and the power manifests.

    DCs for the ability check depend on the level of the power: 0-level, DC 11; 1st-level, DC 13; 2nd-level, DC 15; and 3rd-level, DC 17.

###

    Bonus Feats




    At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Telepath gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Telepath must meet all the prerequisites of the feat to select it.

[
Alertness
](modern-d20-srd-feats-alertness)

###

    Power Crystal




    At 4th level, the Telepath can store excess power points in a power crystal specially attuned to him. Encoding the crystal takes 24 hours and requires a gem with a purchase DC of 20. When complete, the power crystal is a psionically charged crystalline stone no more than an inch in diameter. A Telepath can possess no more than one power crystal at a time.




    A power crystal is imbued with 5 power points when it is created. The Telepath can call upon these power points at any time and use them just as he would his natural power points. Once the crystal is depleted, the Telepath must refill it using up to 5 power points from his own reserves. A power crystal can be recharged after a Telepath has rested and renewed his own reserves of power points for the day..

###

    Combat Manifestation




    At 7th level, a Telepath becomes adept at manifesting
    [
     psionic

powers
](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index)
in combat. He gets a +4 bonus on
[
Concentration
](modern-d20-srd-skills-concentration)
checks to manifest a
[
power
](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index)
while on the defensive.

###

    Maximize Power




    At 10th level, a Telepath learns to manifest
    [
     psionic

powers
](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index)
to maximum effect. All variable, numeric effects of a maximized power automatically achieve their maximum values. A maximized power deals the most possible points of
[
damage
](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
, affects the maximum number of targets, and so forth, as appropriate.
[
Saving
throws
](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
and opposed checks are not affected. Powers without random variables are not affected.

    A maximized
    [
     power
    ](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index)
    costs a number of power points equal to its normal cost +6.
