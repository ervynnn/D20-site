     The caster detoxifies any sort of venom in the creature or object touched. A
     [
      poisoned
     ](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-poison)
     creature suffers no additional damage or effects from the
     [
      poison
     ](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-poison)
     , and any temporary effects are ended, but the spell does not reverse instantaneous effects, such as hit point
     [
      damage
     ](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
     , temporary
     [
      ability

damage
](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-ability-score-reduction)
, or effects that dont go away on their own.

     The creature is immune to any
     [
      poison
     ](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-poison)
     it is exposed to during the duration of the spell. Unlike with delay
     [
      poison
     ](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-poison)
     , such effects arent postponed until after the durationthe creature is simply immune to all
     [
      poison
     ](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-poison)
     effects for the length of the spell.




     This spell can instead neutralize the
     [
      poison
     ](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-poison)
     in a poisonous creature or object for the duration of the spell, at the casters option.
