## Breath Weapon (Su)

A breath weapon [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) usually causes damage and is often based on some type of [energy](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-index). It allows a [Reflex
save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) for half damage with a DC equal to 10 + ½ breathing creatures HD + breathing creatures [Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier (the exact DC is given in the creatures Species Traits). A creature is immune to its own breath weapon and those of others of its kind unless noted otherwise.
