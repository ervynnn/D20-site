## Repair (Int) Trained Only

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): Most Repair [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) are made to fix complex electronic or mechanical devices. The DC is set by the GM. In general, simple repairs have a DC of 10 to 15 and require no more than a few minutes to accomplish. More complex repair work has a DC of 20 or higher and can require an hour or more to complete. Making repairs also involves a monetary cost when spare parts or new components are needed, represented by a [Wealth
check](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check). If the GM decides this isnt necessary for the type of repair the character is attempting, then no [Wealth
check](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check) is needed.

| Repair Task (Example)                                   | Purchase DC | Repair DC |    Time |
| :------------------------------------------------------ | :---------: | :-------: | ------: |
| Simple (tool, simple weapon)                            |      4      |    10     |  1 min. |
| Moderate (mechanical or electronic component)           |      7      |    15     | 10 min. |
| Complex (mechanical or electronic device)               |     10      |    20     |   1 hr. |
| Advanced (cutting-edge mechanical or electronic device) |     13      |    25     |  10 hr. |

Jury-Rig: A character can choose to attempt jury-rigged, or temporary, repairs. Doing this reduces the purchase DC by 3 and the Repair [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) DC by 5, and allows the character to make the checks in as little as a [full-round](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions) action. However, a jury-rigged repair can only fix a single problem with a [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), and the temporary repair only lasts until the end of the current scene or encounter. The jury-rigged object must be fully repaired thereafter.

A character can also use jury-rig to hot-wire a car or jump-start an engine or electronic device. The DC for this is at least 15, and it can be higher depending on the presence of security devices.

The jury-rig application of the Repair skill can be used untrained.

Try Again?: Yes, though in some specific cases, the GM may decide that a failed Repair [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) has negative ramifications that prevent repeated [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

Special: A character can [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) or [take 20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index) on a Repair [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). When making a Repair [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) to accomplish a jury-rig repair, a character cant [take
20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index).

Repair requires an [electrical
tool kit](modern-d20-srd-equipment-professional-equipment), a [mechanical
tool kit](modern-d20-srd-equipment-professional-equipment), or a [multipurpose
tool](modern-d20-srd-equipment-professional-equipment), depending on the task. If the character do not have the appropriate tools, he or she takes a 4 penalty on the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

[Craft (mechanical)](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft-mechanical) or [Craft
(electronic)](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft-electronic) can provide a +2 [synergy
bonus](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-synergy-index) on Repair [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) made for mechanical or electronic devices (see [Skill
Synergy](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-synergy-index)).

A character with the [Gearhead](modern-d20-srd-feats-gearhead) feat and at least 1 rank in this skill gets a +2 bonus on all Repair [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

Time: See the table for guidelines. A character can make a jury-rig repair
as a [full-round action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions), but the work only lasts until the end of the current
encounter.
