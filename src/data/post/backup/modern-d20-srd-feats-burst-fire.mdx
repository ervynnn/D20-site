## Burst Fire

Prerequisites: [Wisdom](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) 13, [Personal
Firearms Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-personal-firearms-proficiency), [Advanced
Firearms Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-advanced-firearms-proficiency).

Benefit: When using an automatic firearm with at least five bullets loaded, the character may fire a short burst as a single attack against a single target. The character receives a 4 penalty on the [attack
roll](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll), but deal +2 dice of [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage).

Firing a burst expends five bullets and can only be done if the weapon has five bullets in it.

Normal: Autofire uses ten bullets, targets a 10-foot-by-10-foot area, and cant be aimed at a specific target. Without this feat, if a character attempts an autofire attack at a specific target, it simply counts as a normal attack and all the extra bullets are wasted.

Special: If the firearm has a three-round burst setting, firing a burst expends three bullets instead of five and can be used if the weapon has only three bullets in it.
