For the character who doesnt want to be bogged down by more cumbersome armor types, a leather garment or some sort of concealable armor is just the ticket.

### Leather Jacket

This armor is represented by a heavy leather bikers jacket. A number of other impromptu armors, such as a football pads and a baseball catchers pads, offer similar protection and game statistics.

### Leather Armor

This archaic armor consists of a breastplate made of thick, lacquered leather, along with softer leather coverings for other parts of the body.

### Light Undercover Shirt

Designed for deep undercover work in which its critical that the wearer not appear to be armed or armored, this garment consists of a T-shirt with a band of light protective material sewn in around the lower torso.

### Pull-Up Pouch Vest

This garment, consisting of a torso apron of light protective material held up by a loop around the neck, can be stored in an innocuous fanny pack. Deploying the apron is a move action. This garment provides no equipment bonus (and has no armor penalty or maximum Dexterity bonus) when undeployed.

### Undercover Vest

Covering a larger area of the torso, this vest provides better protection than the light undercover shirtbut its also more easily noticed. Its best used when the armor should remain unseen but the wearer doesnt expect to face much scrutiny, granting a +2 bonus on [Spot](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) to notice the armor.
