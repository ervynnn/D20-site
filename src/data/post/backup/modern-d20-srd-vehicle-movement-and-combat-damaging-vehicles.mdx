## Damaging Vehicles

All [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) have [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points), which are roughly equivalent to a characters [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points). Like most inanimate objects, [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) also have hardness. Whenever a [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) takes damage, subtract the vehicles hardness from the damage dealt.

When a [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) is reduced to 0 [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points), it is disabled. Although it might be [repairable](modern-d20-srd-skills-repair), it ceases functioning. A [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) that is disabled while [moving](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-moving) drops one speed category each round until it comes to a stop. The driver cannot attempt any [maneuvers](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-simple-maneuvers) except a [45-degree
turn](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-simple-maneuvers).

Unlike characters, [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) dont die when they reach 10 hit points. Instead, a [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) is destroyed when it loses [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points) equal to twice its full normal total. A destroyed vehicle cannot be [repaired](modern-d20-srd-skills-repair).

Energy Attacks: [Vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) are treated as [objects](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-an-object) when subjected to energy attacks.

Exploding Vehicles: If the [attack](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-attack-options) that disables a [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) deals [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) equal to half its full normal [hit
points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points) or more, the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) explodes after 1d6 rounds. This explosion deals 10d6 points of [fire
damage](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-heat-cold) to everyone within the vehicle ([Reflex
save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws), DC 20, for half damage), and half that much to everyone and everything within 30 feet of the explosion ([Reflex
save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws), DC 15, for half damage).
