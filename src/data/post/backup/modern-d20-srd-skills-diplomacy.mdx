## Diplomacy (Cha)

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): A character can change others attitudes with a successful [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (see the table below. In negotiations, participants roll opposed Diplomacy [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) to see who gains the advantage. Opposed [checks](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check) also resolve cases where two advocates or diplomats plead opposing cases before a third party.

Diplomacy can be used to influence a GM characters attitude. The GM chooses the characters initial attitude based on circumstances. Most of the time, the people the heroes meet are indifferent toward them, but a specific situation may call for a different initial attitude. The DCs given in the accompanying table show what it takes to change someones attitude with the use of the Diplomacy skill. The character doesnt
declare a specific outcome he or she is trying for; instead, make the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) and
compare the result to the table on the next page.

Try Again?: Generally, trying
again
doesnt work. Even if the initial check succeeds, the other character can only be persuaded so far. If the initial check fails, the other character has probably become more firmly committed to his or her position, and trying again is futile.

Special: A character can [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) when making a Diplomacy check, but cant [take
20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index).

A character with the [Trustworthy](modern-d20-srd-feats-trustworthy) feat gets a +2 bonus on all Diplomacy [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

Time: Diplomacy is at least a [full-round
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions). The GM may determine that some negotiations require a longer period of time.

Bribery and Diplomacy

| Bribe Target   | Purchase DC |
| :------------- | ----------: |
| Bouncer        |           6 |
| Bureaucrat     |          10 |
| Informant      |           7 |
| Police officer |          10 |

Offering money or another form of favor can, in the right situation, improve a characters chances with a Diplomacy skill [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). Bribery allows a character to circumvent various official obstacles when a person in a position of trust or authority is willing to accept such an offering.

An illegal act, bribery requires two willing participantsone to offer a bribe
and the other to accept it. When a character requires a bribe to render services,
then a heros Diplomacy [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) automatically
fails if a bribe isnt attached to it. If a bribe isnt required, a hero can
add
a bribe to get a bonus on his or her skill [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). This can backfire, as some
characters will be insulted by a bribe offer (their attitude changes one step
for the worse) and others will report the hero to the proper authorities.

To bribe a character, make a [Wealth
check](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check). Typical DCs are shown on below, but the GM may modify the DC as he or she sees fit. If the hero succeeds in the [check](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check), he or she gains a +2 bonus on the Diplomacy [check](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-general). For every point by which the hero beats the DC, increase the bonus by +1 (to a total maximum bonus of +10).
