The caster can whisper messages and receive whispered replies with little chance of being overheard. The caster designates each creature to be included in the spell effect. When the caster whispers, the whispered message is audible to all of the targeted creatures who are within range. Magical [silence](modern-d20-srd-fx-silence), 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal (or a thin sheet of lead), or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks the spell. The message, however, does not have to travel in a straight line. It can circumvent a barrier if there is an open path between the caster and the subject, and the paths entire length lies within the spells range. The creatures who receive the message can whisper a reply that the caster hears. The spell transmits sound, not meaning. It doesnt transcend language barriers.
