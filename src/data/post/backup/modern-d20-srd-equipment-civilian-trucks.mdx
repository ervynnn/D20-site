Trucks include pickups, sport utility vehicles, vans, and minivans. They generally have the same features as civilian cars.

Like cars, trucks generally provide three-quarters [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover) to their occupants. The rear bed of a pickup truck, however, provides only one-half [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover).

### AM General Hummer

The four-door Hummer is a civilian version of the militarys all-terrain humvee utility vehicle. It comes equipped with a powerful 6.5-liter, 195-horsepower V8 turbo diesel engine. The hummer is decked out like a luxury vehicle inside, but this vehicle is every bit as rugged as the military version.

The military version can be configured in a variety of ways, including a two-door
pickup, a four-door pickup with a short bed, and a completely enclosed, SUV-like
body with a hatchback and four doors. It lacks the luxury accessories of the
civilian version, but it is equipped with puncture-resistant tires.

A Hummer is two squares wide and four squares long.

### Chevrolet Suburban

One of the largest sport utility vans on the market, the Suburban is a four-door truck equipped with a standard 6.0-liter, 320-horsepower V8 engine. It is two squares wide and four squares long.

### Dodge Caravan

### Ford Escape XLT
