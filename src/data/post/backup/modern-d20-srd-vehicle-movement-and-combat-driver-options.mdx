## Driver Options

Here is what a [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) driver can do in a single round:

Choose the [Vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) Speed: The driver may increase or decrease his or her [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) speed category by one (or keep it the same).

Optional [Attack Action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions): If the driver wants, he or she can use his or her [attack
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) before moving the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles). If the driver does so, however, he or she will be limited to a single [stunt](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-stunts) during [movement](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-moving).

[Movement](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-moving): Move the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) any number of squares within the [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) [speed
category](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-declaring-speed). Along the way, perform any number of [simple
maneuvers](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-simple-maneuvers) (limited only by their movement cost). The driver may also attempt a single [stunt](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-stunts) as part of the movement (or two, if the driver didnt take his or her [attack
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) before [moving](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-moving)).

Optional [Attack Action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions): If the driver did not take an [attack
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) before [moving](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-moving), and performed one or fewer [stunts](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-stunts), the driver has an [attack
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) left.
