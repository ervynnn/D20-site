## Driving a Vehicle

Driving a [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) is a [move
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions), taken by the [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) driver. During his or her [move
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions), the driver moves the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) a number of squares that falls within its [speed
category](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-declaring-speed). The driver can attempt [maneuvers](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-simple-maneuvers) to change the [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) course or speed. These [maneuvers](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-simple-maneuvers) can be attempted at any point along the [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) route. The driver can choose to use his or her [attack
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) to attempt additional [maneuvers](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-simple-maneuvers).

The two kinds of [vehicle
movement](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-moving) are [simple
maneuvers](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-simple-maneuvers) and [stunts](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-stunts).

[Simple
Maneuvers](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-simple-maneuvers): A [simple
maneuver](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-simple-maneuvers), such as a 45-degree turn, is easy to perform. Each is a [free
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types) and can be taken as many times as the driver likes while he or she moves the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles). However, [simple
maneuvers](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-simple-maneuvers) do cost [movement](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions)so a [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) that makes a lot of [simple
maneuvers](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-simple-maneuvers) will not get as far as one going in a straight line. [Simple
maneuvers](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-simple-maneuvers) do not require the driver to make [skill
checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics).

[Stunts](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-stunts): [Stunts](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-stunts) are difficult and sometimes daring maneuvers that enable a driver to change his or her [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) speed or heading more radically than a [simple
maneuver](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-simple-maneuvers) allows. A [stunt](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions) is a move action. It can be taken as part of a [move
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions) to control the vehicle, and a second [stunt](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-stunts) can be attempted in lieu of the drivers [attack
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions). [Stunts](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-stunts) always require [Drive](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics).
