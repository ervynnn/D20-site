     The manifester forges a telepathic bond with one or more people or creatures, which must have
     [
      Intelligence
     ](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)
     scores of 6 or higher. The bond can be established only with willing subjects, who therefore receive no saving throw and gain no benefit from power resistance. The manifester can communicate telepathically through the bond even if he or she does not share a common language with the subjects. No special power or influence is established as a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance.
