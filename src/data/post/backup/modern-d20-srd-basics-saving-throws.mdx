## Saving Throws

Generally, when a hero is subject to an unusual or magical attack, he or she gets a saving throw to avoid or reduce the effect. Like an [attack
roll](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll), a saving throw is a 1d20 roll plus a bonus based on the heros class and level (the heros base save bonus) and an [ability
modifier](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores).

A natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on a saving throw is always a failure. A natural 20 (the d20 comes up 20) is always a success.

A characters saving throw bonus is:

Base save bonus + [ability modifier](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)

The Difficulty Class for a save is determined by the attack itself.

The three different kinds of saving throws are:

Fortitude: These saves measure the characters ability to stand up to massive physical punishment or attacks against his or her vitality and health such as poison and paralysis. Apply the characters [Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier to his or her Fortitude saving throws.

Reflex: These saves test the characters ability to dodge massive attacks such as explosions or car wrecks. (Often, when damage is inevitable, the character gets to make a Reflex save to take only half damage.) Apply the characters [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier to his or her Reflex saving throws.

Will: These saves reflect the characters resistance to mental influence and domination as well as to many magical effects. Apply the characters [Wisdom](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier to his or her Will saving throws.
