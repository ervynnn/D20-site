    The manifester influences the actions of the target by suggesting a course of action (limited to a sentence or two). The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the action sound reasonable.  The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested action can be completed in a shorter time, the power ends when the subject finishes what he or she was asked to do. The manifester can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special action during the duration. If the condition is not met before the power expires, the action is not performed.




    A very reasonable suggestion causes the
    [
     saving

throw
](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
to be made with a penalty at the discretion of the GM.
