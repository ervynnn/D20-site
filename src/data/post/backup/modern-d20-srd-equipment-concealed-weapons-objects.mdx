## Concealed Weapons and Objects

Its assumed that, when attempting to conceal a weapon or other object, a character is wearing appropriate clothing.

Drawing a concealed weapon is more difficult than drawing a regularly holstered weapon, and normally requires an attack action. Keeping the weapon in an easier-to-draw position makes concealing it more difficult.

### Sleight of Hand Checks

To conceal a weapon or other object, make a [Sleight
of Hand](modern-d20-srd-skills-sleight-of-hand) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). A character concealing an object before he or she heads out into public can usually [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) unless he or she is rushed, trying to conceal it when others might see, or under other unusual constraints. [Sleight
of Hand](modern-d20-srd-skills-sleight-of-hand) can be used untrained in this instance, but the character must [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index).

### Size and Concealment

The objects size affects the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) result, as shown on Table: Concealing Weapons and Objects. The type of holster used or clothing worn, and any attempt to make a weapon easier to draw, can also affect the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

### Spotting Concealed Objects

Noticing a concealed weapon or other object requires a [Spot](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). The DC varies: If the target made a roll when concealing an object, the DC of the [Spot](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) to notice the object is the same as the targets check result (an opposed check, in other words). If the target took 10 on his or her [Sleight of Hand](modern-d20-srd-skills-sleight-of-hand) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), use this formula:

[Spot](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot) DC = Targets [Sleight
of Hand](modern-d20-srd-skills-sleight-of-hand) skill modifier (including modifiers from Table: Concealing Weapons and Objects) + 10

An observer attempting to spot a concealed object receives a 1 penalty for every 10 feet between him or herself and the target, and a 5 penalty if distracted.

Patting someone down for a hidden weapon requires a similar [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).
However, the skill employed is [Search](modern-d20-srd-skills-search),
and the searcher gets a +4 circumstance bonus for the hands-on act of frisking
the target. Some devices may also offer bonuses under certain circumstances
(a metal detector offers a bonus to [Search](modern-d20-srd-skills-search) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) to find metal objects, for
example).

### Spotting Concealable Armor

Concealable armor can be worn under clothing if the wearer wants it to go unnoticed. Dont use the modifiers from Table: Concealing Weapons and Objects when wearing concealable armor. Instead, anyone attempting to notice the armor must make a [Spot](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 30).
