## Invisibility Sphere

Illusion

[Level](modern-d20-srd-fx-level): [Mage](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-mage) 3; [Components](modern-d20-srd-fx-components): V, S, M; [Casting Time](modern-d20-srd-fx-casting-time); [Attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) [Range](modern-d20-srd-fx-range): Personal or touch; [Area](modern-d20-srd-fx-area): 10-ft.-radius sphere around the creature or object touched; [Duration](modern-d20-srd-fx-duration): 1 minute/level (D); [Saving Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): Will negates (harmless) or Will negates (harmless, object); [Spell Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance): Yes (harmless) or Yes (harmless, object)

All creatures within 10 feet of the recipient, including the recipient, vanish from sight, even from darkvision. The center of the effect is mobile with the recipient. If the creatures are carrying gear, the gear vanishes, too. Those affected by this spell cannot see each other but can see themselves. Any affected creature moving out of the area becomes visible, but creatures moving into the area after the spell is cast do not become invisible. Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so. Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet beyond the range of the spell becomes visible.

The subjects are not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render a recipient detectable. Affected creatures (other than the recipient) who attack negate the invisibility only for themselves. If the spell recipient attacks, the invisibility sphere ends. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible characters perceptions.) Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. If a subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Note that spells that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.

An invisible creature gains a +40 bonus on [Hide](modern-d20-srd-skills-hide) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) if
immobile, or a +20 bonus on [Hide](modern-d20-srd-skills-hide) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) if
moving. Pinpointing the location of an invisible character who isnt attempting
to hide requires a [Spot](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot-php#skill-check-index) against
DC 40 if immobile or DC 20 if moving.
