## On-Hand Objects

To account for the mundane and innocuous objects that most people have among their possessionsand not force every character to specifically purchase such objects in order to employ themuse the following rules.

With the GMs permission, a character can make a [Wealth
check](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check) to see if he or she has a mundane object on hand, as long as the object has a purchase DC of 10 or lower. (The GM determines the purchase DC for an object thats not mentioned in this chapter, using similarly priced objects as a guide.) The [Wealth
check](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check) works the same as for buying the object, except that the character takes a 10 penalty on the check, and he or she cant [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) or [take 20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index). Also, a character cant make a [Wealth
check](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check) to see if he or she has a mundane object on hand during character generation or between adventuresonly during play. If the character succeeds, his or her [Wealth
bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus) is unaffected, even if the objects purchase DC is higher than his or her [Wealth
bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus).

Depending on the situation, the GM can rule that a certain mundane object is not available; for an object to be obtainable, the character must be in a place where the object logically would be.
