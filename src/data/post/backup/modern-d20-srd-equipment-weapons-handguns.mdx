A handgun is a personal firearm that can be used one-handed without penalty. This includes all pistols and some submachine guns and shotguns. All handguns require the [Personal
Firearms Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-personal-firearms-proficiency) feat. Using a handgun without this feat imposes a 4 penalty on attack rolls.

Handguns can be broken down into three smaller groups: autoloaders, revolvers, and machine pistols.

Autoloaders (sometimes called automatics) feature removable box magazines, and some models hold quite a lot of ammunition. They work by using the energy of a shot fired to throw back a slide, eject the shots shell casing, and scoop the next round into the chamber. They are more complex than revolvers, but nevertheless have become increasingly popular in the modern age.

Revolvers are relatively simple firearms that store several rounds (usually six) in a revolving cylinder. As the trigger is pulled, the cylinder revolves to bring the next bullet in line with the barrel.

Machine pistols are automatic weapons small enough to be fired with one hand. Some are autoloader pistols modified to fire a burst of bullets in a single pull of the trigger, while others are modified submachine guns, cut down in size and weight to allow one-handed use.

Ranged weapons that use box magazines come with one full magazine.

### Beretta 92F

The standard service pistol of the United States military and many American law enforcement agencies.

### Beretta 93R

This close relative of the Beretta 92F looks like a large autoloader but can fire on automatic. It sports a fold-down grip in front of the trigger guard, an extendable steel shoulder stock that is attached to the butt of the pistol, and an extended magazine.

This weapon features a three-round burst setting. When used with the [Burst
Fire](modern-d20-srd-feats-burst-fire) feat, it fires only three bullets instead of five and can be used with only three bullets in the weapon. This setting does not grant the ability to make burst fire attacks without the [Burst
Fire](modern-d20-srd-feats-burst-fire) feat; if a character uses the setting without the feat, he or she makes a normal attack, and the extra two bullets are wasted.

### Colt Double Eagle

Based on the M1911 mechanism, this pistol is an updated civilian version that fires a 10mm round.

### Colt M1911

This .45 semiautomatic pistol was used by the United States military for decades until it was recently replaced by the Beretta 92F. Manufactured at three locations in the United States alone, the M1911 can be found all over the world, and is still in use in several other military forces.

### Colt Python

The Python has a well-deserved reputation for accuracy. Due to its high quality of manufacture, the Colt Python is always considered a [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) weapon. As such, it grants a +1 bonus on [attack
rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll).

### Derringer

This pistol breaks open at the breech like a double-barreled shotgun. The two-shot weapon has one barrel atop the other and is barely 5 inches long, making it easy to conceal.

### Desert Eagle

Manufactured by Israeli Military Industries, the Desert Eagle is the king of large-frame, heavy-caliber autoloaders. The version on Table: Ranged Weapons fires the massive .50 Action Express round. The Desert Eagle also comes in .357 Magnum and .44 Magnum models.

### Glock 17

The Glock is typical of 9mm self-loading pistols carried by many police officers and military personnel.

Due to its high quality of manufacture, the Glock 17 is always considered a [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) weapon. As such, it grants a +1 bonus on [attack
rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll).

### Glock 20

This slightly larger version of the Glock 17 is chambered for the slightly more powerful 10mm round.

Due to its high quality of manufacture, the Glock 20 is always considered a [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) weapon. As such, it grants a +1 bonus on [attack
rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll).

### MAC Ingram M10

No longer in production, about 10,000 of these small submachine guns were made and supplied to United States police forces, the U.S. Army, Cuba, and Peru. Light pressure on the trigger produces single shots, while increased pressure brings automatic fire.

The M10 accepts a suppressor without modification.

### Pathfinder

The Pathfinder is a high-quality weapon used as a concealed backup weapon by police officers or for personal defense. The Pathfinder is typical of a number of short-barreled (3 inches) small-caliber revolvers.

### Ruger Service-Six

This revolver, designed specifically for police use, fires the .38 Special round. It was very popular with United States police forces prior to the increasing use of autoloaders in recent decades, and is still in service with many police forces today.

### S&W; M29

The Smith & Wesson Model 29 .44 Magnum revolver fires one of the most powerful pistol cartridges in the world. The M29 is known for its deafening sound, bright muzzle flash, and powerful recoil.

### SITES M9 Resolver

The compact SITES weapon is very narrow, making it easy to conceal.

### Skorpion

The CZ61 Skorpion is a Czech machine pistol seen increasingly in the West since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Originally intended for military vehicle crews who dont have space for an unwieldy longarm, it was widely distributed to Communist countries and in central Africa, and can now be found anywhere in the world.

### TEC-9

The Intratec TEC-9 is an inexpensive machine pistol popular with criminals because it can be modified ([Repair](modern-d20-srd-skills-repair) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) DC 15) to fire on automatic. The pistol only works on semiautomatic fire or, if modified, only on automatic. Once modified to fire on automatic, the TEC-9 cannot be changed back to semiautomatic.

### Walther PPK

The PPK is a small, simple, and reliable autoloader with a design that dates back to the 1930s. It remains in widespread service among European police, military, and government agencies.
