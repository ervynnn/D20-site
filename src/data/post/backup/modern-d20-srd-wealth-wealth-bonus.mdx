## Wealth Bonus

To determine a characters starting Wealth bonus, roll 2d4 and add the wealth bonus for the characters [starting
occupation](modern-d20-srd-starting-occupation-index), plus (if appropriate) the bonus from the [Windfall](modern-d20-srd-feats-windfall) feat, plus 1 if the character has ranks in [Profession](modern-d20-srd-skills-profession).

Over the course of play, the heros Wealth bonus will [decrease](modern-d20-srd-wealth-losing-wealth) as the hero purchases expensive [items](modern-d20-srd-equipment-index) and [increase](modern-d20-srd-wealth-regaining-wealth) as the hero gains levels.

A characters Wealth bonus can never fall below +0, and there is no limit to how high the Wealth bonus can climb.

Since Wealth is an abstract concept, its sometimes difficult to determine how financially well off a character is. To get a general sense of how financially solvent a character is at any given time, check the table below.

| Wealth Bonus  |     Financial Condition |
| :------------ | ----------------------: |
| +0            | Impoverished or in debt |
| +1 to +4      |              Struggling |
| +5 to +10     |            Middle class |
| +11 to +15    |                Affluent |
| +16 to +20    |                 Wealthy |
| +21 to +30    |                    Rich |
| +31 or higher |               Very rich |
