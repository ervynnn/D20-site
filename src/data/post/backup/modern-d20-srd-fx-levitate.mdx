## Levitate

Transmutation

[Level](modern-d20-srd-fx-level): [Mage](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-mage) 2; [Components](modern-d20-srd-fx-components): V, S, F; [Casting Time](modern-d20-srd-fx-casting-time); [Attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) [Range](modern-d20-srd-fx-range): Personal or close (25 ft.+ 5 ft./2 levels); [Target](modern-d20-srd-fx-target): You or one willing creature or one object (total weight up to 100 lb./level); [Duration](modern-d20-srd-fx-duration): 1 round/level (D); [Saving Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): None; [Spell Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance): No

A creature must be willing to be levitated, and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature. The caster can mentally direct the subject to move up or down as much as 20 feet each round; doing so is a move-equivalent action. The caster cannot move the recipient horizontally, but the subject could push or pull his or her way provided there is a surface to grasp (generally at half its base speed).

A levitating creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) is made with a 1 penalty, the second 2, and so on, up to a maximum penalty of 5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at 1.
