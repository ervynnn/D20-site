### Class Features

The following features pertain to the Personality advanced class.

### Unlimited Access

| Upgrade                                     | Diplomacy DC |
| :------------------------------------------ | -----------: |
| Seat at sporting event to field pass        |           10 |
| Hotel room to suite                         |           15 |
| Concert or theater ticket to backstage pass |           20 |
| Economy transportation to first-class       |           25 |

When others would normally make a [Diplomacy](modern-d20-srd-skills-diplomacy) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) or [Bluff](modern-d20-srd-skills-bluff) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) to smooth-talk or trick their way into a private party or invitation-only event, the Personality adds a bonus equal to his or her Personality level.

When a Personality buys a ticket to a show or for transportation, he or she can make a [Diplomacy](modern-d20-srd-skills-diplomacy) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) to get that ticket upgraded. DCs are given below.

### Bonus Class Skill

At 2nd and again at 7th level, the Personality designates one cross-class skill as a class skill. Once designated, the skill is considered a class skill every time the character adds a new level of Personality.

### Bonus Feats

At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Personality gets a bonus [feat](modern-d20-srd-feats-index). The bonus [feat](modern-d20-srd-feats-index) must be selected from the following list, and the Personality must meet all the prerequisites of the [feat](modern-d20-srd-feats-index) to select it.

[Alertness](modern-d20-srd-feats-alertness), [Animal
Affinity](modern-d20-srd-feats-animal-affinity), [Combat Expertise](modern-d20-srd-feats-combat-expertise), [Confident](modern-d20-srd-feats-confident), [Creative](modern-d20-srd-feats-creative), [Deceptive](modern-d20-srd-feats-deceptive), [Defensive
Martial Arts](modern-d20-srd-feats-defensive-martial-arts), [Educated](modern-d20-srd-feats-educated), [Trustworthy](modern-d20-srd-feats-trustworthy).

### Royalty

At 4th and 8th level, a Personalitys activities in the public eye generate extra income. This income provides a [Wealth
bonus](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-bonus) increase of +4.

### Winning Smile

At 5th level, a Personality develops such a force of personal magnetism that he or she can convince a single target to regard him or her as a trusted friend. (If the target is currently being threatened or attacked by the Personality or his or her allies, this ability wont work.)

The target makes a Will [saving throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) to avoid being persuaded by the Personalitys words and actions. The DC is 10 + Personalitys class level + Personalitys [Charisma](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) bonus.

This ability doesnt enable the Personality to control the target, but the target perceives the Personalitys words and actions in the most favorable way. The Personality can try to give the target orders, but he or she must win an opposed [Charisma](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) check to convince the target to perform any actions the target wouldnt normally undertake. The target never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, and any act by the Personality or his or her allies that threatens the target breaks the mood and clears the targets head. Otherwise, a target remains won over for 1 minute per Personality level.

After the duration expires, the GM determines the reaction and attitude of the target based on what the Personality compelled the target to do.

This is a Mind-Affecting ability.

### Compelling Performance

At 10th level, a Personalitys force of personal magnetism increases to the point that he or she can arouse a single emotion of his or her choicedespair, hope, or ragein a target. To use this ability, the Personality must spend 1 [action
point](modern-d20-srd-basics-action-points). The emotion he or she arouses affects one target (a GM character) within 15 feet of the Personality (or within 15 feet of a television, radio, or telephone that broadcasts the Personalitys performance). The performance requires a [full-round
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions), and its effects on the target last for 1d4+1 rounds.

The target makes a Will [saving throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws). The DC is 10 + Personalitys class level + Personalitys [Charisma](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) bonus. If the target succeeds at the [saving throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws), he or she is immune to the compulsion of this performance. If the target fails, he or she reacts to the emotion as described below.

Despair: The target takes a 2 morale penalty on [saving throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)s, [attack
rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll), [ability checks](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores), [skill checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), and weapon [damage
rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage).

Hope: The target gains a +2 morale bonus on [saving throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)s, [attack
rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll), [ability checks](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores), [skill checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), and weapon [damage
rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage).

Rage: The target gains a +2 morale bonus to [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) and [Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores), a +1 morale bonus on [Will save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)s, and a 1 penalty to [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense). In a dramatic situation, the target is compelled to fight, regardless of the danger.
