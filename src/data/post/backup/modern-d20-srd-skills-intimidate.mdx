## Intimidate (Cha)

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): With a successful [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), a character can forcibly persuade another character to perform some task or behave in a certain way. A characters Intimidate [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) is opposed by the targets level check (1d20 + the targets character level or Hit Dice). Any modifiers that a target may have on [Will
saving throws](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) against fear effects apply to this level check. If the character succeeds, he or she may treat the target as friendly for 10 minutes, but only for purposes of actions taken while in the characters presence. (That is, the target retains his or her normal attitude, but will chat, advise, offer limited help, or advocate on the characters behalf while intimidated.)

Circumstances dramatically affect the effectiveness of an Intimidate [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

There are limits to what a successful Intimidate [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) can do.

The character cant force someone to obey his or her every command or do something that endangers that persons life.

If the character fails by more than 5, the target may actually do the opposite of what the character wishes.

Try Again?: No. Even if the initial [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) succeeds, the other character can only be intimidated so much, and trying again doesnt help. If the initial [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) fails, the other character has become more firmly resolved to resist the intimidator, and trying again is futile.

Special: A character can [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) when making an Intimidate check, but cant [take
20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index).

A character immune to fear effects cant be intimidated.

A character may add a +2 bonus to his or her Intimidate [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) for every size category the character is larger than his or her target. Conversely, the character takes a 2 penalty to his or her [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) for every size category the character is smaller than his or her target.

A character with the [Confident](modern-d20-srd-feats-confident) feat gets a +2 bonus on all Intimidate [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) and on level checks to resist intimidation.

Time: An Intimidate [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) is a [full-round
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions).
