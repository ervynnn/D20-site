## Shout

Evocation [Sonic]

[Level](modern-d20-srd-fx-level): [Mage](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-mage) 4; [Components](modern-d20-srd-fx-components): V; [Casting Time](modern-d20-srd-fx-casting-time); [Attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) [Range](modern-d20-srd-fx-range): Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels); [Area](modern-d20-srd-fx-area): Cone; [Duration](modern-d20-srd-fx-duration): Instantaneous; [Saving Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): Fortitude partial (see text) (object); [Spell Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance): Yes (object)

The caster emits an ear-splitting yell that deafens and damages creatures in its path. Any creature within the area is deafened for 2d6 rounds and takes 2d6 points of [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage). A successful [save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) negates the deafness and reduces the [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) by half. Any exposed brittle or crystalline object takes 1d6 points of [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) per caster level. Creatures holding fragile objects can negate [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) to them with successful [Reflex
saves](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws).

A deafened character, in addition to the obvious effects, suffers a Â–4 penalty on [initiative](modern-d20-srd-combat-initiative) checks, automatically fails [Listen](modern-d20-srd-skills-listen) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), and has a 20% chance to miscast and lose any spell with a verbal component that he or she tries to cast.
The shout spell cannot penetrate the spell [silence](modern-d20-srd-fx-silence).
