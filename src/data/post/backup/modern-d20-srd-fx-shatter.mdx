     Used as an area attack, shatter destroys nonmagical objects of crystal, glass, porcelain, or ceramic, such as vials, bottles, flasks, jugs, windows, mirrors, and so forth. All such objects within a 5-foot radius of the point of origin are smashed into dozens of pieces by the spell. Objects weighing more than 1 pound per caster level are not affected, but all other objects of the appropriate composition are shattered.




     Alternatively, the caster can target this spell against a single solid object, regardless of composition, weighing up to 10 pounds per caster level.




     Targeted against a crystalline creature (of any weight), shatter deals 1d6 points of sonic
