## Navigate (Int)

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): Make
a Navigate [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) when
a character is trying to find his or her way to a distant location without
directions or other specific guidance. Generally, a character does not need
to make a [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) to
find a local street or other common urban site, or to follow an accurate map.
However, the character might make a [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) to
wind his or her way through a dense forest or a labyrinth of underground storm
drains.

For movement over a great distance, make a Navigate [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). The DC depends on the length of the trip. If the character succeeds, he or she moves via the best reasonable course toward his or her goal. If the character fails, he or she still reaches the goal, but it takes the character twice as long (the character loses time backtracking and correcting his or her path). If the character fails by more than 5, the or she travels the expected time, but only gets halfway to his or her destination, at which point the character becomes lost.

A character may make a second Navigate [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 20) to regain his or her path. If the character succeeds, he or she continues on to his or her destination; the total time for the trip is twice the normal time. If the character fails, he or she loses half a day before the character can try again. The character keeps trying until he or she succeeds, losing half a day for each failure.

| Length of Trip             |  DC |
| :------------------------- | --: |
| Short (a few hours)        |  20 |
| Moderate (a day or two)    |  22 |
| Long (up to a week)        |  25 |
| Extreme (more than a week) |  28 |

When faced with multiple choices, such as at a branch in a tunnel, a character can make a Navigate [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 20) to intuit the choice that takes the character toward a known destination. If unsuccessful, the character chooses the wrong path, but at the next juncture, with a successful [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), the character realizes his or her mistake.

A character cannot use this function of Navigate to find a path to a site if the character has no idea where the site is located. The GM may choose to make the Navigate [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) for the character in secret, so he or she doesnÂ’t know from the result whether the character is following the right or wrong path.

A character can use Navigate to determine his or her position on earth without the use of any high-tech equipment by checking the constellations or other natural landmarks. The character must have a clear view of the night sky to make this [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). The DC is 15.

Special: A character can [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) when making a Navigate [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). A character can [take
20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index) only when determining his or her location, not when traveling.

A character with the [Guide](modern-d20-srd-feats-guide) feat gets a +2 bonus on all Navigate [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

Time: A Navigate [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) is a [full-round
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions).
