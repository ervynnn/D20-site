## Trip

A character can try to trip an opponent, or otherwise knock him or her down, as an unarmed melee attack. A character can only trip an opponent who is one size category larger than the character, the same size, or smaller.

### Making a Trip Attack

Make an unarmed [melee
touch attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) against the target. Doing this provokes an [attack
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity) from the target as normal for unarmed attacks.

If the attack succeeds, make a [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) check opposed by the targets [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) check or [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) check (using whichever ability score has the higher modifier). If the character and the target are different sizes, the larger combatant gets a bonus on the [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) check of +4 per difference in size category. The target gets a +4 stability bonus on his or her check if he or she has more than two legs or is otherwise exceptionally stable. If the character wins, he or she trips the target. If the character loses, the target may immediately react and make a [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) check opposed by the characters [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) check or [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) check to try to trip the character.

### Being Tripped (Prone)

A tripped character is prone (see [Table:
Defense Modifiers](modern-d20-srd-combat-favorable-unfavorable-conditions)). Standing up from a prone position is a [move
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions).

### Tripping with a Weapon

Some weapons, such as the chain and the whip, can be used to make trip attacks. A character doesnt incur an [attack
of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity) when doing so. If the character is tripped during his or her own trip attempt, the character can drop the weapon to avoid being tripped.
