## Haste

Transmutation

[Level](modern-d20-srd-fx-level): [Mage](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-mage) 3; [Components](modern-d20-srd-fx-components): V, S, M; [Casting Time](modern-d20-srd-fx-casting-time); [Attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) [Range](modern-d20-srd-fx-range): Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels); [Target](modern-d20-srd-fx-target): One creature; [Duration](modern-d20-srd-fx-duration): 1 round/level; [Saving Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): Fortitude negates (harmless); [Spell Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance): Yes (harmless)

The transmuted creature moves and acts more quickly than normal. This extra speed has several effects.

When making a [full attack
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions), the subject may make one extra [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) with any weapon he or she is holding. The attack is made using the characters full [base
attack bonus](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll), plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This benefit does not actually grant an extra action, so a character cant use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.)

The subject gains a +2 dodge bonus to [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense). Any condition that makes the subject lose his or her [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) bonus to [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) (if any) also makes the subject lose dodge bonuses.

All of the subjects modes of movement (including normal movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet (to a maximum of double the subjects normal speed).

Haste dispels and counters [slow](modern-d20-srd-fx-slow).
