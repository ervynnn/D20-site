## Dead Aim

Prerequisites: [Wisdom](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) 13, [Far
Shot](modern-d20-srd-feats-far-shot).

Benefit: Before making a ranged [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions), the character may take a [full-round
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions) to line up your shot. This grants the character a +2 circumstance bonus on his or her next [attack
roll](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll). Once the character begins aiming, he or she cant move, even to take a 5-foot step, until after the character makes his or her next [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll), or the benefit of the feat is lost. Likewise, if the characters concentration is disrupted or the character is attacked before his or her next action, the character loses the benefit of aiming.
