## Knockout Punch

Prerequisites: [Brawl](modern-d20-srd-feats-brawl), base attack bonus +3.

Benefit: When making the characterÂ’s first unarmed [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) against a flat-footed opponent, treat a successful [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) as a [critical
hit](modern-d20-srd-combat-critical-hits). This damage is nonlethal [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage).

Special: Even if the character has the ability to treat unarmed [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) as lethal [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage), the [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) from a knockout punch is always nonlethal.
