## Spells

Hit Dice: The term Hit Dice is used synonymously with character levels for effects that affect a number of Hit Dice of creatures. A creature with only Hit Dice from its species, not from any classes it may have, has a character level equal to its Hit Dice. A creature with class levels is considered to have Hit Dice equal to the total of its Hit Dice and its class levels.

Caster [Level](modern-d20-srd-fx-level): A spells power often depends on caster level, which is the casters level in the appropriate spellcasting class. Creatures with no classes have a caster level equal to their Hit Dice unless otherwise specified.

Creatures and Characters: Creatures and characters are used synonymously in the spell descriptions.

List Format: Spells in the following lists are presented in order of spell level (from lowest to highest) and alphabetized within each level group. A brief description of the spells effect is provided.
