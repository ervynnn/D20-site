The caster creates an invisible magical sensor that sends him or her visual information. The caster can create the arcane eye at any point he or she can see, but it can then travel outside the casterÂ’s line of sight without hindrance. The arcane eye travels 30 feet per round (300 feet per minute) if viewing an area ahead primarily looking at the floor or 10 feet per round (100 feet per minute) if examining the ceiling and walls as well as the floor ahead. The arcane eye sees exactly as the caster would see if he or she were there. The arcane eye can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. Solid barriers prevent the passage of an arcane eye, although it can pass through a space no smaller than 1 inch in diameter.

The caster must concentrate to use the eye. If the caster does not concentrate, the eye is inert until the caster again concentrates.
