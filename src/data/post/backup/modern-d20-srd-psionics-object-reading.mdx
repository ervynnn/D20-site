    This power provides information about an objects previous owner.  The amount of information revealed depends on how long the manifester studies a particular object.




    1st Round: Last owners gender.




    2nd Round: Last owners age.




    3rd Round: Last owners appearance.




    4th Round: Last owners primary
    [
     allegiance

    (if any).




    5th Round: How last owner gained and lost the object.




    6th+ Round: Previous-to-last owners gender, and so on.




    An object without any previous owners reveals no information. A manifester can continue to run down the list of previous owners and learn details about them as long as the powers duration lasts. If the manifester reads the same object again, he or she doesnt pick up where he or she left off in the list of previous owners.
