     Resolving Collisions




     The base
     [
      damage
     ](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
     dealt by a
     [
      vehicle

collision
](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming)
depends on the
[
speed
](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed)
and size of the objects involved. Use the highest
[
speed
](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed)
and the smallest size of the two colliding objects and refer to Table: Collision Damage.

| Table: Collision Damage |     |
| :---------------------- | --: |
|                         |     |

| Smallest Object or Creature Size | Number of Dice |
| :------------------------------- | -------------: |
| Colossal                         |             20 |
| Gargantuan                       |             16 |
| Huge                             |             12 |
| Large                            |              8 |
| Medium-size                      |              4 |
| Small                            |              2 |
| Tiny                             |              1 |
| Smaller than Tiny                |              0 |

     After finding the base
     [
      damage
     ](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-damaging-vehicles)
     , determine the
     [
      collisions
     ](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming)
     damage multiplier based on how the colliding
     [
      vehicle
     ](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
     struck the other
     [
      vehicle
     ](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
     or object. (For
     [
      vehicles
     ](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
     moving in reverse, consider the back end to be the vehicles front for determining the collision multiplier.) Consult Table: Collision Direction for a multiplier.

Once the
[
damage
](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-damaging-vehicles)
has been determined, apply it to both
[
vehicles
](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
(or objects or creatures) involved in the
[
collision
](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming)
. Both
[
vehicles
](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
reduce their
[
speed
](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed)
by two
[
speed
categories
](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed)
. If the
[
colliding
](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming)
[
vehicle
](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
moved the minimum number of squares for its new
[
speed
category
](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed)
before the
[
collision
](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming)
, it ends its movement immediately. If not, it pushes the other
[
vehicle
](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
or object aside, if possible, and continues until it has moved the minimum number of squares for its new
[
speed
category
](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed)
.

     must

immediately make a
