## Explosives and Splash Weapons

These weapons explode or burst, dealing damage to creatures or objects within an area.

Explosives can be thrown or set off in place, depending on the type of explosive device. Dynamite and hand grenades are examples of these weapons.

All explosives must be detonated. Some, such as grenades, include built-in detonators. (Pulling the pin on a grenade is a [free
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types).) Others require timers or other devices to set them off. Detonators are covered in [Weapon
Accessories](modern-d20-srd-equipment-weapon-accessories).

A splash weapon is a projectile that bursts on impact, spewing its contents over an area and damaging any creature or object within that area.

Generally, creatures directly hit by splash weapons take the most damage, while those nearby take less damage. Splash weapons usually must be thrown to have effect.

Explosives and splash weapons require no feat to use with proficiency unless they are fired or propelled from some sort of launcher or other device, in which case the appropriate [Weapon Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-exotic-firearms-proficiency) [feat](modern-d20-srd-feats-index) for the launcher is necessary to avoid the 4 nonproficient penalty.

### Explosives and Splash Weapons Table

Explosives and splash weapons are described by a number of statistics.

Damage/Direct Hit [Damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage): The primary [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) dealt by the weapon. For explosives, the [Damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) column shows the damage dealt to all creatures within the explosives burst radius. For splash weapons, the Direct Hit [Damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) column is used for a target directly struck by the weapon.

Burst Radius/Splash [Damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage): For explosives, the burst radius is the area affected by the explosive. All creatures or objects within the burst radius take [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) from the explosive.

For splash weapons, all creatures within 5 feet of the weapons impact point take splash [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) equal to the amount shown in this column.

[Damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) Type: [Damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) from explosives and splash weapons is classified according to type: energy (of a specific type) or slashing. Some creatures or characters may be resistant or immune to some forms of [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage).

[Critical](modern-d20-srd-combat-critical-hits): The threat range for a [critical
hit](modern-d20-srd-combat-critical-hits). If the threat is confirmed, a weapon deals double [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) on a [critical
hit](modern-d20-srd-combat-critical-hits) (roll damage twice, as if hitting the target two times).

[Reflex](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) DC: Any creature caught within the burst radius of an explosive may make a [Reflex
save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) against the DC given in this column for half damage.

Range Increment: If the weapon can be thrown, its range increment is shown in this column. Explosives with no range increment must be set in place before being detonated. (See the [Demolitions](modern-d20-srd-skills-demolitions) skill)

Size: Size categories for weapons and other objects are defined differently from the size categories for creatures. The relationship between a weapons size and that of its wielder defines whether it can be used one-handed, if it requires two hands, and if its a light weapon.

A Medium-size or smaller weapon can be used one-handed or two-handed.

A Small or smaller weapon is considered a light weapon. It can be used one-handed and, as a light weapon, is easier to use in a characters off hand.

Weight: This column gives the weapons weight.

Purchase DC: This is the purchase DC for a [Wealth
check](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check) to acquire the weapon. This number reflects the base price and doesnt include any modifier for purchasing the weapon on the black market.

[Restriction](modern-d20-srd-equipment-restricted-objects): The restriction rating for the weapon, if any, and the appropriate black market purchase DC modifier. Remember to apply this modifier to the purchase DC when making a [Wealth
check](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check) to acquire the weapon on the black market.
