## Damage

When a character hits with a [weapon](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-weapons), he or she deals damage according to the type of [weapon](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-weapons). Effects that modify [weapon](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-weapons) damage also apply to unarmed strikes and the natural physical attack forms of creatures.

Damage is deducted from the targets current hit points.

### Minimum Weapon Damage

If penalties to damage bring the damage result below 1, a hit still deals 1 point of damage.

### Strength Bonus

When a character hits with a melee weapon or thrown weapon, add his or her [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier to the damage.

Off-Hand Weapon: When a character deals damage with a weapon in his or her
off hand, add only half of the characters [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) bonus.

Wielding a Weapon Two-Handed: When a character deals damage with a weapon that he or she is wielding two-handed, add 1.5 times the characters [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) bonus. However, the character doesnt get this higher [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) bonus when using a light weapon two-handed; in such a case, only the characters normal [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) bonus applies to the damage roll.
