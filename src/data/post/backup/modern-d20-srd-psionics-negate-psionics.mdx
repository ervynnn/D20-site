     Negate psionics can be used to end ongoing powers that are manifested on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the psionic abilities of a psionic item, or to end ongoing power (or at least their effects) within an area. A negated power ends as if its duration had expired. Negate psionics can negate (but not counter) the ongoing effects of supernatural abilities as well as psionic powers. Negate psionics affects spell-like abilities just as it affects powers (and spells). A manifester cant use negate psionics to undo the effects of any power with instantaneous duration.




     The manifester chooses to use negate psionics in one of two ways: a targeted

negation or an area negation:

     Targeted Negation: One object, creature, or power

is the target of the power. The manifester makes a negation check against the
power or against each ongoing power currently in effect on the object or creature.
A negation check is 1d20 + 1 per manifester level against a DC of 11 + the
manifester level of the power to be negated.
If the object that targeted is a psionic item, the manifester makes a negation
check against the items manifester level. If the manifester succeeds, all
the items psionic properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the
item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonpsionic for the duration
of the effect.

     The manifester automatically succeed on the negation check against any power that he or she manifested his or herself.




     Area Negation: The power affects everything within a 30-foot radius.




     For each creature that is the target of one or more powers, the manifester makes a negation check against the power with the highest manifester level. If that fails, he or she makes negation checks against progressively weaker powers until he or she negates one power (which discharges the negate psionics so far as that target is concerned) or fails all his or her checks. The creatures psionic items are not affected.




     For each object that is the target of one or more powers, the manifester makes negation checks as with creatures. Psionic items are not affected by area negations.




     For each ongoing power with an area centered within the negate psionics target area, the manifester makes a negation check to negate the power.




     For each ongoing power whose area overlaps with that of the negation, the manifester makes a negation check to end the effect, but only within the area of the negate psionics.
