## Change Self

Illusion

[Level](modern-d20-srd-fx-level): [Mage](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-mage) 1; [Components](modern-d20-srd-fx-components): V, S; [Casting Time](modern-d20-srd-fx-casting-time): [Attack
action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions); [Range](modern-d20-srd-fx-range): Personal; [Target](modern-d20-srd-fx-target): You; [Duration](modern-d20-srd-fx-duration): 10 minutes/level (D)

The caster can make him or herselfincluding [clothing](modern-d20-srd-equipment-clothing), [armor](modern-d20-srd-equipment-armor-general), [weapons](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-weapons), and [equipment](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-general)look different. The caster can seem 1 foot shorter or taller, thin, fat, or in between. The caster cannot change body type. Otherwise, the changes can be as minor or as major as the caster desires.

The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form. It does not alter the perceived tactile (touch) or audible (sound) properties of the caster or his or her equipment.

If a character uses this spell to create a disguise, he or she gets a +10 bonus on the [Disguise](modern-d20-srd-skills-disguise) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

Note: Creatures get a [Will
save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) to recognize the illusion if they interact with it.
