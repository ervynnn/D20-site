[Future D20 SRD]( / ) > Robots




## Track (PL 5)


The robot follows a preset track and cannot deviate from that course. If the robot is somehow separated from the track, it becomes effectively stationary. The robot can maneuver over an obstacle only if the track leads over the obstacle, but if something obstructs the track, the robot comes to a halt.


Base Speed: 10 feet.


Purchase DC: One-tenth the base purchase DC of the robot's frame (rounded down).
