## Class II Sensor System (PL 5)


This sensor system includes a video camera with infrared capability, capable of discerning creatures and objects by their heat signatures. It also includes a basic audio receiver and a crude chemical sniffer (a series of filters that detect free-floating chemical residues).


A robot with a Class II sensor system takes a '4 penalty on all Demolitions, Disable Device, Forgery, and Repair checks. All other skill checks are made without penalty.


Type: Audio, Olfactory, Visual.


Purchase DC: 15.
