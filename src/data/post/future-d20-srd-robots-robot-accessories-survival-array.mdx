## Survivor Array (PL 6)


Robots are often used to explore environments inhospitable to organic creatures. The survivor array enables the robot to better traverse harsh terrain and withstand hostile conditions. A survivor array includes the following units:


- Topographical and astronomical guidance systems that grant a +10 equipment bonus on Navigate checks.
- A gyroscopic unit that improves the robot’s base speed by +10 feet.
- A pressure-sealed, energy-resistant frame that allows the robot to function normally in low-gravity, high-gravity, and zero-gravity conditions, prevents oxidation and corrosion, and provides resistance to acid 10, cold 10, electricity 10, and fire 10.
- A nightvision amplifier that grants the robot darkvision out to a range of 60 feet or extends its normal darkvision range by +60 feet.


Purchase DC: 15 + one-half the base purchase DC of the robot’s frame.


Restriction: Licensed (+1).
