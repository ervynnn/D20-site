##  Seed Descriptions

Each seed description hereafter describes the relevant Knowledge (arcane lore)
check DC for incantations using the seed and describes typical effects that
incantations with that seed produce. Most of the parameters of the seed
(range, duration, and so on) can be modified for a specific incantation by
applying factors, described in the seed description and in Table: General
Factors.

The following seeds can be used alone or in combination to create incantations
for any purpose. If you’re seeking an effect not described below, simply
choose a seed that approximates what you’re looking for, then apply an ad-hoc
adjustment as you see fit.
