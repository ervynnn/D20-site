## 
     Ansible (PL 9)
    



     The ansible is a device that induces precise changes in the energy states of atomic nuclei, without regard to distance or time. In effect, it permits instantaneous interstellar communicationsvoice, video, or data transferto any other ship or station equipped with an ansible. Much like a radio, the receiving station has to be attentive to a particular frequency, so two ansible-equipped stations must have some prearranged communications protocols; an ansible cannot pick up any transmissions not intended for that specific frequency.
