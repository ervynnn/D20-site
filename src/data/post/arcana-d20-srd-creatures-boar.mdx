##  Boar

Boars are about 4 feet long and 3 feet high at the shoulder.

###  Species Traits

Boars have the following traits:

Ferocity (Ex): Boars are such tenacious combatants that they continue to fight
without penalty until reduced to –10 hit points. At –10 hit points, they are
slain.

Scent (Ex): This ability allows the wild boar to detect approaching enemies,
sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Low-Light Vision (Ex): Boars can see twice as far as a human in starlight,
moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. They
retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
