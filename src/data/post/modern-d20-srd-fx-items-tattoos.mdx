## Tattoos

Tattoos are single-use “items” containing a [spell-like](modern-d20-srd-fx-index) or [psionic](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index) effect that affects only the bearer. They can be drawn or imprinted just about anywhere on the body; however, the bearer of a [magic](modern-d20-srd-fx-index) or [psionic](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index) tattoo must touch it (and speak a command word) to activate its power, so tattoos are normally placed in easy-to-reach places.

[Magic](modern-d20-srd-fx-index) and [psionic](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index) tattoos are permanent until activated or dispelled.

Activating a tattoo is an [attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions), requires the utterance of a command word, and does not provoke [attacks of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity).

Purchase DC: A tattoo’s purchase DC is 15 + the tattoo’s caster level or manifester level + spell level or power level unless noted otherwise. The purchase DC includes the cost of drawing or imprinting the tattoo on the body.
