##  Spellslinger

You have a gift for magic that allows you to cast more spells than normal.

**Prerequisite:** Intelligence 13 (for arcane spellcasters) or Wisdom 13 (for
divine spellcasters).

**Benefit:** For any one spellcasting advanced class in which you have levels,
you can prepare and cast one additional spell per spell level known. For
instance, Lily Parrish, a 3rd-level Dedicated Hero/3rd-level Acolyte, can
prepare and cast an additional 0-level, 1st-level, and 2nd-level divine spell
per day (since she can cast up to and including 2nd-level divine spells).

**Special:** You may gain this feat multiple times. Each time you take the
feat, it applies to a new spellcasting class.
