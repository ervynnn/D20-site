    Spellslinger




    You have a gift for magic that allows you to cast more spells than normal.





     Prerequisite:

    Intelligence 13 (for arcane spellcasters) or Wisdom 13 (for divine spellcasters).





     Benefit:

    For any one spellcasting advanced class in which you have levels, you can prepare and cast one additional spell per spell level known. For instance, Lily Parrish, a 3rd-level Dedicated Hero/3rd-level Acolyte, can prepare and cast an additional 0-level, 1st-level, and 2nd-level divine spell per day (since she can cast up to and including 2nd-level divine spells).





     Special:

    You may gain this feat multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new spellcasting class.
