##  Mystic Veil

Illusion

B; Casting Time: 70 minutes (minimum); Range: 55 ft.; Effect: Visual and
audible figment that covers 12 10-foot cubes (S); Duration: 12 hours; Saving
Throw: None or Will disbelief (if interacted with) (see text); Spell

This incantation combines several elements to create a powerful protection
from scrying and direct observation. When casting the incantation, you dictate
what will and will not be observed in the incantationâ€™s area. The illusion
created must be stated in general terms. Once the conditions are set, they
cannot be changed.

Attempts to scry the area automatically detect the image stated by you with no
save allowed. Sight and sound are appropriate to the illusion created. A band
of people standing in a meadow could be concealed as an empty meadow with
birds chirping, for instance.

Direct observation may allow a save (as per a normal illusion), if there is
cause to disbelieve what is seen. Certainly onlookers in the area would become
suspicious if marching soldiers disappeared at one point to reappear at
another. Even entering the area does not cancel the illusion or necessarily
allow a save, assuming that hidden beings take care to stay out of the way of
those affected by the illusion.

Options: You can create the material component for the mystic veil illusion
yourself at no cost. If you do, the incantation also requires a successful
Craft (visual arts) check (DC 34).

Material Component: Realistic paintings, digitally-altered photos, or other
representations of the desired illusion (purchase DC 17).

Backlash: Caster takes 2d6 points of damage.

Failure: Delusion. The caster and anyone else present at the conclusion of the
incantation believe the mystic veil is effective, but no one else is fooled.
