     Paint-On LCD
    



     One of the most revolutionary advances in computer technology during the Information Age and beyond is the paint-on LCD gadget. This allows almost any surface to be used as a computer display, as it grafts the color-changing pixels common to all display devices onto another surface.
    



     Any piece of equipment with the paint-on LCD gadget can be used as a display for any piece of computer or communications equipment. Additionally, weapons and armor may make use of the paint-on LCD gadget at the normal cost, but gain no special benefit from the modification other than being able to display data.
