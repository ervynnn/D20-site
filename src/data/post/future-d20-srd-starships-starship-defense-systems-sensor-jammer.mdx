## Sensor Jammer (PL 5)


A sensor jammer interferes with radar and enemy sensor scans. It also confounds missile guidance systems.


Sensor checks made against a ship with an active sensor jammer take a '5 penalty. In addition, the ship gains one-half concealment against missile attacks (20% miss chance).


Any ship with a Class III sensor system (or better) is not subject to the effects of the sensor jammer, ignoring the penalty and miss chance.


Purchase DC: 5 + one-half the base purchase DC of the starship.


Restriction: Military (+3).
