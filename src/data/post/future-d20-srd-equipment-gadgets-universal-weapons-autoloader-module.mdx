## 
     Autoloader Module
    



     Many weapons rely on box magazines or power packs to function. The autoloader gadget facilitates quick reloading. This may come in the form of an integrated power pack alternator, or in spring-mounted magazine loaders worn on the wrist of the user. Regardless of their location on the owner's body or the form that the autoloader takes, a weapon with the autoloader module gadget is always automatically reloaded as a free action as soon as the previous magazine or power pack is expended. This module cannot be transferred from one weapon to another, even those of similar types, due to the fact that each autoloader module is keyed to the individual weapon for which it was designed.
