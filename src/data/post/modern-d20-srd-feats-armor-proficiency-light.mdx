## Armor Proficiency (Light)

Benefit: When a character wears a type of armor with which he or she is
proficient, the character gets to add the armor’s equipment bonus to his or
her [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense). Also, the [armor check penalty](modern-d20-srd-equipment-armor-general) applies only to
[Balance](modern-d20-srd-skills-balance), [Climb](modern-d20-srd-skills-climb), [Escape Artist](modern-d20-srd-skills-escape-artist),
[Hide](modern-d20-srd-skills-hide), [Jump](modern-d20-srd-skills-jump), [Move Silently](modern-d20-srd-skills-move-silently), and [Tumble](modern-d20-srd-skills-tumble) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

Normal: A character who wears armor with which he or she is not proficient
adds only the armor’s nonproficient equipment bonus to his or her
[Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense). Also, he or she suffers its [armor check penalty](modern-d20-srd-equipment-armor-general) on [attack rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) and on all [skill checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) that involve
moving.
