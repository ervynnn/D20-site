## Cover

Cover provides a bonus to [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover). The more
cover a character has, the bigger the bonus. In a melee, if a character has
cover against an opponent, that opponent probably has cover against the
character, too. With ranged weapons, however, it’s easy to have better cover
than the opponent.

The GM may impose other penalties or restrictions on [attacks](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) depending on the details of the cover.

### Degree of Cover

Cover is assessed in subjective measurements of how much protection it offers.
The GM determines the value of cover. This measure is not a strict
mathematical calculation, because a character gains more value from covering
the parts of his or her body that are more likely to be struck. If the bottom
half of a character’s body is covered, that only gives one-quarter cover,
because most vital areas are still fully exposed. If one side or the other of
a character’s body is covered, the character gets one-half cover.

### Cover Defense Bonus

Table: Cover gives the Defense bonuses for different degrees of cover. Add the
relevant number to the character’s Defense. This cover bonus overlaps (does
not stack) with certain other bonuses.

### Cover [Reflex Save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) Bonus

Table: Cover gives the [Reflex save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
bonuses for different degrees of cover. Add this bonus to [Reflex saves](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) against attacks that affect an
area. This bonus only applies to attacks that originate or burst out from a
point on the other side of the cover.

### Striking the Cover Instead of a Missed Target

If it ever becomes important to know whether the cover was actually struck by
an incoming attack that misses the intended target, the GM should determine if
the attack roll would have hit the protected target without the cover. If the
[attack roll](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) falls within a range low
enough to miss the target with cover but high enough to strike the target if
there had been no cover, the object used for cover was struck. This can be
particularly important to know in cases when a character uses another
character as cover. In such a case, if the cover is struck and the attack roll
exceeds the [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) of the covering
character, the covering character takes the damage intended for the target.

If the covering character has a [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) bonus to [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) or a dodge bonus,
and this bonus keeps the covering character from being hit, then the original
target is hit instead. The covering character has dodged out of the way and
didn’t provide cover after all. A covering character can choose not to apply
his or her [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) bonus to
[Defense](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) and/or his or her dodge bonus,
if the character so desires.
