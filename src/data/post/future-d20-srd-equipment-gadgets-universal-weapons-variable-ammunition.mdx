## Variable Ammunition
    



     Firearms typically draw their ammunition from a single source and do so until they are reloaded with a fresh magazine. The variable ammunition gadget changes this; it allows the user to load an additional type of ammunition. This essentially doubles the ammunition capacity of the weapon and allows the user to switch between the two different types of ammunition as a free action.
    



     This gadget may be selected multiple times, each time adding a single additional magazine capacity for a different type of ammunition.
