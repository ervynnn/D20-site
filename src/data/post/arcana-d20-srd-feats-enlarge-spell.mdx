## 
     Enlarge Spell [Metamagic]
    



     You can cast spells farther than normal.
    




      Benefit:
     
     An enlarged spell has its range doubled. Spells whose ranges are not defined by distance do not have their ranges increased. A spell whose area or effect is determined by its range (such as bless or a cone spell) has the dimensions of its area or effect increased proportionally.
    



     An enlarged spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spells actual level.
