## Starship Weapons


Starship weapons fall into one of four categories: beam weapons, projectile weapons, missiles, and mines. Each category of weapon is described in greater detail below.


Starship weapons require the Starship Gunnery feat to operate proficiently. Without this feat, a gunner takes a '4 penalty on attack rolls made with starship weapons. Trained, expert, and ace crew gunners are assumed to have this feat.


To build a starship weapon system from scratch, a character must succeed at a Craft (mechanical) check (DC 30) after investing 300 hours in its assembly. A character without a mechanical tool kit takes a '4 penalty on the skill check. The character must also make a Wealth check against the weapon's purchase DC.
Installing a weapon system requires a successful Craft (mechanical) check (DC 30) after investing 30 hours. A character without a mechanical tool kit takes a '4 penalty on the skill check.


Modifying Weapons: Certain beam and projectile weaponsas noted in Table: Starship Weaponscan be modified for different rates of fire. With 1 hour of work and a successful Repair check (DC 30), these weapons can be reconfigured for semiautomatic or automatic fire mode. (Resetting a weapon to its original configuration requires another check and 1 hour.) Weapons can be purchased in their modified versions, but the purchase DC of a modified weapon increases by +3.


### Average Weapon Damage


Some starship weapons (particularly fire-linked weapons) deal incredible damage. To speed up play, you can decide to deal average damage with weapon attacks instead of rolling handfuls of dice and adding them up. Table: Starship Weapons lists average damage in parentheses in the Damage column.
