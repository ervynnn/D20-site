Keeping an eye on suspects or tracking the moves of potential enemies is a crucial part of the modern adventurer’s job.

### Black Box

This device, easily concealed in the palm of one hand, emits digital tones that convince the phone system to make a long-distance connection free of charge. They also let a user “bounce” a call through multiple switches, making the call harder to trace (the DC of any [Computer Use](modern-d20-srd-skills-computer-use) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) to trace the call is increased by 5).

### Caller ID Defeater

When a phone line contains a caller ID defeater, phones attempting to connect with that line show up as “anonymous” or “unavailable” on a caller ID unit. Such a call can still be traced as normal, however.

### Cellular Interceptor

About the size of a small briefcase, a cellular interceptor can detect and monitor a cell phone conversation within a 5-mile area by listening in on the cellular service’s own transmitters. Intercepting the calls of a particular cell phone requires a [Computer Use](modern-d20-srd-skills-computer-use) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 35); if the user knows the phone number of the phone in question, the DC drops by 10. Obviously, the phone must be in use for someone to intercept the call. A cellular interceptor cannot be used to intercept regular (ground line) phone connections.

### Lineman’s Buttset

This device resembles an oversized telephone handset with a numeric keypad on the back and wire leads hanging from the bottom. It functions as a portable, reusable telephone line tap. With a [Repair](modern-d20-srd-skills-repair) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 10), a user can connect to a phone wire and hear any conversation that crosses it. A lineman’s buttset is a common tool for telephone repair personnel.

### Metal Detector

This handheld device provides a +10 equipment bonus on all [Search](modern-d20-srd-skills-search) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) involving metal objects.

### Night Vision Goggles

Night vision goggles use passive light gathering to improve vision in near-dark conditions. They grant the user the ability to see in darkness, also called [darkvision](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-darkvision) (range 120 ft.)—but because of the restricted field of view and lack of depth perception these goggles provide, they impose a –4 penalty on all [Spot](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot) and [Search](modern-d20-srd-skills-search) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) made by someone wearing them.

Night vision goggles must have at least a little light to operate. A cloudy night provides sufficient ambient light, but a pitch-black cave or a sealed room doesn’t. For situations of total darkness, the goggles come with an infrared illuminator that, when switched on, operates like a standard flashlight whose light is visible only to the wearer (or anyone else wearing night vision goggles).

### Tap Detector

Plug this into a telephone line between the phone and the outlet, and it helps detect if the line is tapped. To detect a tap, make a [Computer Use](modern-d20-srd-skills-computer-use) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (the DC varies according to the type of telephone tap used; see below). With a success, the tap detector indicates that a tap is present. It does not indicate the type or location of the tap however. Also, it can’t be used to detect a lineman’s buttset.

### Telephone Tap

These devices allow a character to listen to conversations over a particular phone line.

Line Tap: This tap can be attached to a phone line at any point between a phone and the nearest junction box (usually on the street nearby). Installing it requires a [Repair](modern-d20-srd-skills-repair) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 15). It broadcasts all conversations on the line over a radio frequency that can be picked up by any professional walkie-talkie. Detecting a line tap by using a tap detector requires a [Computer Use](modern-d20-srd-skills-computer-use) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 25).

Receiver Tap: This item can be easily slipped into a telephone handset as a [Repair](modern-d20-srd-skills-repair) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 5). It broadcasts all conversations over a radio frequency that can be picked up by any professional walkie-talkie. Detecting a receiver tap by using a tap detector requires a [Computer Use](modern-d20-srd-skills-computer-use) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 15).

### Telephone Line Tracer

Essentially a highly specialized computer, a line tracer hooked to a phone line can trace phone calls made to that line, even if there’s a caller ID defeater hooked up at the other end. All it takes is time.

Operating a line tracer is a full-round action requiring a [Computer Use](modern-d20-srd-skills-computer-use) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 10). Success gains one digit of the target phone number, starting with the first number of the area code.
