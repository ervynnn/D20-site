## Gravity Age Armor Gadgets


The following gadgets are found in the Gravity Age and can apply to armors of that era or later, provided all gadget-specific restrictions are observed.


### Chameleonic Surface


Chameleonic materials are the end result of the marriage of sensor technology and nanotechnology. Similar in many ways to the painton LCD of the Information Age, the chameleonic surface armor gadget allows any armor to remake its own image to better blend in with the background. Microsensors on the surface of the armor detect surrounding imagery and project it from the opposite side, in effect coloring the wearer to look just like whatever is behind him. The armor blends in with any background.


This gadget provides the armor's wearer a bonus on Hide checks. For light armor, this bonus is +4; for medium, +6, for heavy, powered, and environmentally sealed armor, +10.


Restrictions: None.
Purchase DC Modifier: +6.
