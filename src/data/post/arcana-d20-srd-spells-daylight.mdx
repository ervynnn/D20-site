     Daylight




     Evocation [Light]




     Level: Divine 2; Components: V, DF; Casting Time: Attack action; Range: Touch; Target: Object touched; Duration: 10 minutes/level (D); Saving Throw: None; Spell Resistance: No




     The object touched sheds light as bright as full daylight in a 60-foot radius. Creatures who suffer penalties in bright light suffer them while exposed to this magical light. Despite its name, this spell isnt equivalent to daylight insofar as it does not damage or destroy creatures normally harmed by daylight (such as vampires). If the spell is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a lightproof covering, the spells effects are blocked until the covering is removed.




     Daylight brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) is temporarily negated, so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect.




     Daylight counters or dispels any darkness spell of equal or lower level, such as darkness.
