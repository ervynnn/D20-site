[Future D20 SRD]( / ) > Starships




## Initiative


Every round, each starship gets to do something. The starships' initiative checks, from highest to lowest, determine the order in which they act.


### Initiative Checks


At the start of a battle, each starship makes a single initiative check. An initiative check is a Dexterity check that uses the starship pilot's Dexterity modifier. (A ship without a pilot has an initiative check modifier of +0.) A pilot with the Improved Initiative feat gets a +4 bonus on the check.


The GM determines what order starships are acting in, counting down from highest initiative result to lowest, and each starship acts in turn. On all following rounds, the starships act in the same order (unless a starship takes an action that changes its initiative; see Special Initiative Actions). If two or more starships have the same initiative check result, the starships that are tied go in order of total initiative modifier (including Dexterity modifier and Improved Initiative feat bonus, if applicable). If there is still a tie, roll a die.


Flat-Footed Starships: At the start of a battle, before a starship has had a chance to act (specifically, before its first turn in the initiative order), it is flat-footed. It can't apply the pilot's Dexterity bonus to Defense while flat-footed.
