## Poisonous Blood [DRAWBACK]


Your blood is poisonous to your own body. You must take regular doses of antitox to resist the poisons effects.


MP Value: 6.


Drawback: If you go 24 hours without taking a dose of antitox you must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 15) or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage.
Taking a dose of antitox cures the ability damage caused by antitox deprivation in 1d6 rounds. Ability damage caused by antitox deprivation cannot be restored through natural healing.


Special: This drawback can be taken only in Progress Level 6 or higher campaigns (when antitox is available).
