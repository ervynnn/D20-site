## 
    Ultralight Composition
   



    The development of new and experimental alloys constantly allows armor technology to advance to the point where once bulky and heavy armors become as easy to carry as lighter models. Any armor with the ultralight composition gadget weighs significantly less than similar pieces of armor and is more easily used and worn. The armor reduces its Armor Check Penalty (if any) by 1. Furthermore, the armor's speed limitation is increased by 5 feet (to a maximum of the user's normal speed). So, for example, an armor with an Armor Check Penalty of '2 and a speed limitation of 20 feet now has an Armor Check Penalty of '1 and a speed limitation of 25 feet.
