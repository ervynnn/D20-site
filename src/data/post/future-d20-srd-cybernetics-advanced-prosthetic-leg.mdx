## 
    Advanced Prosthetic Leg (PL 7)
   



    This upgraded version of the PL 5 prosthetic leg and PL 6 upgrade not only replaces a lost or destroyed leg but is also more resilient and less impairing than its technological predecessors.

    Type: External.
   



    Hardness/Hit Points: 5/15.
   



    Base Purchase DC: 22.
   



    Restriction: None.
