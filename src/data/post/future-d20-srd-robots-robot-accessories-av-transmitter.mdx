## AV Transmitter (PL 5)


A remote audio-visual unit consists of a video camera and microphone connected to the robot’s visual and audio sensors, with a transmitter to send the information to a computer or a remote control unit (see Remote Control Unit, below). The AV transmitter includes a transmitter with an effective range of 1,000 feet. This unit does not allow a remote operator to control the robot (but see Robolink, below). It merely allows the operator to see and hear what the robot sees and hears.


Purchase DC: 16.


Restriction: None.
