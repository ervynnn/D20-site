## Starship Defense Systems


Armor does an admirable job of preventing damage to the superstructure of a starship, but it's really only the last line of defense. Since the late Industrial Age, aircraft have been outfitted with an ever-increasing number of defensive systems designed to avoid or avert damage to a craft's hullÂ—or to repair it before catastrophe occurs.


To build a defense system from scratch, a character must succeed at a Craft (electronic) check (DC 30) and a Craft (mechanical) check after investing 60 hours in its assembly. A character without an electrical or mechanical tool kit takes a '4 penalty on the appropriate skill check. The character must also make a Wealth check against the system's purchase DC.


Installing a defensive system requires a successful Craft (mechanical) check (DC 30) after investing 30 hours. A character without a mechanical tool kit takes a '4 penalty on the skill check.


Different types of defensive systems are detailed below.


Purchase DC: The purchase DC of the system.


Restriction: The level of license required to purchase the system legally.
