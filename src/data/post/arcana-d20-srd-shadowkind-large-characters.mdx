## 
     Large Characters
    



     Large characters take a 1 size penalty to Defense, a 1 size penalty on attack rolls, and a 4 size penalty on Hide checks. Large characters gain a +4 bonus on grapple checks.
    



     Large characters lifting and carrying limits are twice of those of Medium characters.
    



     Large characters generally move as fast as Medium characters.
    



     Large characters may use larger weapons than Medium characters. A Large character may wield a weapon of Large size in one hand and a Huge weapon in two hands. A Large character treats a weapon of Medium or smaller as a light weapon.
    



     Armor for Large creatures must be custom-made and weighs twice as much as Medium armor of similar type. Increase the purchase DC of Large armor by +2.
