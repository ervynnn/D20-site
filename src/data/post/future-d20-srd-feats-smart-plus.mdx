## Smart Plus


Advancements in science coupled with your drive to excel enable you to progress faster toward becoming a truly intelligent hero.


Benefit: You gain two talents from the Smart heros talent trees. The talents must be selected from the following list, you cannot select more than one talent from a single talent tree, and you must meet all the prerequisites of a talent to select it. Savant, Linguist, Exploit Weakness, Plan, Trick.


Special: You may select this feat multiple times. Each time you select this feat, you must choose a different pair of talents. The exception is the savant talent, which you can select multiple times. However, each time you select the savant talent, you must choose a different skill (see the savant talents description).
