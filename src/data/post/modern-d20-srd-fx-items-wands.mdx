## Wands

A wand is a short stick imbued with the power to cast a specific [spell](modern-d20-srd-fx-index) 50 times. The spell must be 4th level or lower, and the wand cannot be recharged. A typical wand has a Defense of 7, hardness 5, 5 hit points, and a break DC of 16.

A [divine spell](modern-d20-srd-fx-divine-spells) wand can be used only by divine spellcasters, while an [arcane spell](modern-d20-srd-fx-arcane-spells) wand can be used only by arcane spellcasters.

Using a wand is an [attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) and does not provoke [attacks of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity). A wand has 50 charges when new.

Purchase DC: Unless noted otherwise, a wand’s purchase DC is 24 + the wand’s caster level + the level of the spell stored in the wand. The purchase DC is for a fully charged wand. For a used wand with 25 charges, reduce the purchase DC by 2.
