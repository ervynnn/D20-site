## Magic Weapon Special Abilities

Most magic weapons have a +1 or better enhancement bonus. They can also have special abilities detailed here. A weapon with a special ability must have at least a +1 enchantment bonus.

Acidic: Upon command, this weapon drips with acid. The acid does not harm the hands that hold the weapon. These weapons deal +1d6 points of bonus acid damage on a successful hit. Ranged weapons so enchanted bestow the energy type upon their ammunition.

Purchase DC Modifier: +1.

Bane: A bane weapon excels at attacking a specific kind of creature (such as black dragons, ogres, or trolls). Against its designated foe, its effective enhancement bonus is +2 better than its normal enhancement bonus and deals +2d6 points of bonus damage against the foe.

Purchase DC Modifier: +2.

Brilliant (melee weapons only): A brilliant energy weapon has its significant portion transformed into light, although this does not modify the items weight. It gives off light as a torch (20-foot radius). A brilliant energy weapon ignores nonliving matter. Equipment and enhancement Defense bonuses do not count against it because the weapon passes through armor. (Dexterity, deflection, dodge, natural armor, and other such bonuses still apply.) A brilliant energy weapon cannot harm undead, constructs, and objects. Ranged weapons cannot be enchanted with this ability.

Purchase DC Modifier: +3.

Chaotic: This weapon is infused with the power of chaos. It deals +2d6 points of bonus damage against any creature with an allegiance to law. It bestows one negative level on any creature with the law allegiance attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way while the weapon is wielded. Ranged weapons so enchanted bestow the power upon their ammunition.

Purchase DC Modifier: +1.

Dancing: A dancing weapon can be loosed (requiring a move action) to attack on its own. It fights for 4 rounds using the base attack bonus of the one who loosed it and then drops. It never leaves the side of the one who loosed it (never straying more than 5 feet) and fights on even if that creature falls. The wielder who loosed it can grasp it while it is attacking on its own as a free action, but when so retrieved it cant dance (attack on its own) again for 4 rounds.

Purchase DC Modifier: +3.

Defending (melee weapons only): A defending weapon allows the wielder to transfer some or all of the weapons enhancement bonus to his Defense as a special bonus that stacks with all others. As a free action, the wielder chooses how to allocate the weapons enhancement bonus at the start of his turn before using the weapon, and the effect to Defense lasts until his next turn. This ability cannot be placed on ranged weapons.

Purchase DC Modifier: +2.

Disruption (melee weapons only): This type of weapons deals +2d6 points of damage to undead creatures.

Distance (ranged weapons only): A weapon of distance doubles its range increment.

Energy Blast: Energy blast weapons come in five types: acid blast, fiery blast, icy blast, electrical blast, and concussive blast. A burst weapon explodes with the appropriate energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic/concussion) upon scoring a successful critical hit. The energy does not harm the hands that hold the weapon. These weapons deal +1d10 points of bonus energy damage (of the requisite type) on a successful critical hit. If the weapons critical multiplier is x3, add +2d10 points of bonus energy damage instead, and if the multiplier is x4, add +3d10 points of bonus energy damage. Ranged weapons so enchanted bestow the energy upon their ammunition.

Any electrical device that is damaged by a shocking blast weapon has its electronics scrambled. A successful Repair check (DC 10 + the damage dealt) fixes the short.

Subjects dealt a critical hit by a concussive blast weapon must make a Fortitude save (DC 14) or be deafened permanently.
