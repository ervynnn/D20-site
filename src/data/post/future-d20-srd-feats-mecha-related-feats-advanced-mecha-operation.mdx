## Advanced Mecha Operation


You have received advanced training or extensive practice in mecha movement.


Prerequisite: Mecha Operation.


Benefit: Choose a size of mecha (Large, Huge, Gargantuan, or Colossal). When you are operating a mecha of the chosen size, you gain a +1 dodge bonus to Defense. Furthermore, armor penalties for operating the mecha are 2 less than they would otherwise be (minimum penalty '0).
