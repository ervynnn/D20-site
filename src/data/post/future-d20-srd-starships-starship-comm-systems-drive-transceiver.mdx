     Drive Transceiver (PL 8)




     The drive transceiver is the first interstellar comm system thats truly practical for small ships or second-rate colonies. It operates like the much larger PL 7 drivesat comm array, sending a signal up to 50 lightyears distant. The signal travels at a rate of 5 light-years per hour. The target station must also be equipped with a drive transceiver.




     Purchase DC: 28.
