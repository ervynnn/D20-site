## 
     Drive Transceiver (PL 8)
    



     The drive transceiver is the first interstellar comm system that's truly practical for small ships or second-rate colonies. It operates like the much larger PL 7 drivesat comm array, sending a signal up to 50 lightyears distant. The signal travels at a rate of 5 light-years per hour. The target station must also be equipped with a drive transceiver.
