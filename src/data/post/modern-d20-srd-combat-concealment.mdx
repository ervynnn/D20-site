## Concealment

Concealment includes all circumstances in which nothing physically blocks a
blow or shot, but something interferes with an attacker’s accuracy.

### Degree of Concealment

Concealment is subjectively measured as to how well concealed the defender is.
Examples of what might qualify as concealment of various degrees are given in
Table: Concealment. Concealment always depends on the point of view of the
attacker.

### Concealment Miss Chance

Concealment gives the subject of a successful [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) a chance that the attacker missed because of the concealment. If
the attacker hits, the defender must make a miss chance percentile roll to
avoid being struck. (Actually, it doesn’t matter who makes the roll or whether
it’s rolled before or after the [attack roll](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll). When multiple concealment conditions apply to a defender, use the one
that would produce the highest miss chance. Do not add the miss chances
together.
