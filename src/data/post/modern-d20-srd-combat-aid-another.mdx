## Aid Another

In combat, a character can help a friend attack or defend by distracting or interfering with an opponent. If the character is in position to [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) an opponent with which a friend of the character is engaged in melee combat, the character can attempt to aid the friend as an [attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions). The character makes an attack roll against [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) 10. If the character succeeds, he or she doesnt actually damage the opponentbut the characters friend gains either a +2 circumstance bonus against that opponent or a +2 circumstance bonus to [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) against that opponent (aiding characters choice) on the friends next turn.
