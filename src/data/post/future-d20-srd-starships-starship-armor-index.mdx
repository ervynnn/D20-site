## Starship Armor


A starship can have only one type of armor installed. To surround a starship's hull in armor or to upgrade the armor, a character must succeed at a Craft (structural) check (DC 30) after investing 600 hours in its assembly. A character without a mechanical tool kit takes a '4 penalty on the skill check. The character must also make a Wealth check against the armor's (or upgraded armor's) purchase DC.


Different types of starship armor are presented below.


Hardness: The amount of damage the armor absorbs from a weapon hit or collision.


Tactical Speed Penalty: The amount by which the armor reduces the starship's tactical speed, given in feet and squares.


Weight: The armor's weight.


Purchase DC: The armor's purchase DC.


Restriction: The restriction rating of the armor.
