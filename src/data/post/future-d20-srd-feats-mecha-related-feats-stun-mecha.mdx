## Stun Mecha


By channeling electricity into an enemy mecha's control system, you can temporarily short it out.


Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +8, Mecha Operation, Precise Shot.


Benefit: If you threaten a critical hit with an electricity attack against another mecha, you may automatically confirm the critical. In addition to suffering the effects of the critical hit, the mecha is automatically stunned for 2d4 rounds. The stunned mecha automatically drops what it is holding and can take no attack or move actions. While the mecha is stunned, apply a '2 penalty to the mecha operator's Defense (even though the operator is not stunned).
