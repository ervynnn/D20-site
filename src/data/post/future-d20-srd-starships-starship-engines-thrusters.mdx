## Thrusters (PL 5)


Thrusters can propel a ship through a planetary atmosphere and land it safely on a planetary surface. Thrusters also serve as secondary engines when primary engines fail or shut down. Common types of thrusters include the scramjet, chemical rocket, repulsion thrust, or powered airfoil, although the exact form doesnt matter.


A ship with thrusters as its primary source of propulsion must refuel after every battle or every orbital mission. Thruster fuel has a purchase DC of 31.


Minimum Ship Size: Huge.


Tactical Speed Bonus: +0 feet.


Purchase DC: 10 + one-half the base purchase DC of the starship.
