     Descriptors




     Descriptors are a way of classifying spells (often from different schools) that have some common characteristic.

A spellÂ’s descriptors (if any) appear in brackets on the line identifying the school. Descriptors used for spells include cold, electricity, fear, fire, force, language-dependent, light, mind-affecting, and sonic.
