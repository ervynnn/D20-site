##  Reach Spell [Metamagic]

You can cast touch spells without touching the spell recipient.

**Benefit:** You may cast a spell that normally has a range of “touch” at any
distance up to 30 feet. You must succeed at a ranged touch attack to cast the
spell upon the recipient. A reach spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher
than the spell’s actual level.
