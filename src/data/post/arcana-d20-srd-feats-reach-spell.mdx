## 
     Reach Spell [Metamagic]
    



     You can cast touch spells without touching the spell recipient.
    




      Benefit:
     
     You may cast a spell that normally has a range of touch at any distance up to 30 feet. You must succeed at a ranged touch attack to cast the spell upon the recipient. A reach spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spells actual level.
