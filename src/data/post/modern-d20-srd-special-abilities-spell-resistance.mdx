## Spell Resistance (Ex)

A creature with spell resistance can avoid the effects of
[spells](modern-d20-srd-fx-index) and spell-like abilities that directly
affect it. To determine whether a [spell](modern-d20-srd-fx-index) or spell-
like ability works, the spellcaster must make a level check (1d20 + caster
level). If the result equals or exceeds the creatureâ€™s spell resistance, the
[spell](modern-d20-srd-fx-index) works normally, although the creature is
still allowed a [saving throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws).
