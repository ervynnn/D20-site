## Perform ([Cha](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores))

This skill encompasses several categories, each of them treated as a separate
skill. These categories are identified and defined below.

The number of Perform categories is kept purposely finite. When trying to
determine what Perform skill a particular type of performance falls under, use
a broad interpretation of the existing categories. Do not arbitrarily make up
new categories.

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): The
character is accomplished in some type of artistic expression and knows how to
put on a performance. The character can impress audiences with his or her
talent and skill. The quality of the character’s performance depends on his or
her [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) result.

The eight Perform categories, and the qualities each one encompasses, are as
follows.

Act: The character is a gifted actor, capable of performing drama, comedy, or
action-oriented roles with some level of skill.

Dance: The character is a gifted dancer, capable of performing rhythmic and
patterned bodily movements to music.

Keyboards: The character is a musician gifted with a talent for playing
keyboard musical instruments, such as piano, organ, and synthesizer.

Percussion Instruments: The character is a musician gifted with a talent for
playing percussion musical instruments, such as drums, cymbals, triangle,
xylophone, and tambourine.

Sing: The character is a musician gifted with a talent for producing musical
tones with your voice.

Stand-Up: The character is a gifted comedian, capable of performing a stand-up
routine before an audience.

Stringed [Instruments](modern-d20-srd-equipment-professional-equipment): The
character is a musician gifted with a talent for playing stringed musical
instruments, such as banjo, guitar, harp, lute, sitar, and violin.

Wind [Instruments](modern-d20-srd-equipment-professional-equipment): The
character is a musician gifted with a talent for playing wind musical
instruments, such as flute, bugle, trumpet, tuba, bagpipes, and trombone.

Try Again?: Not for the same performance and audience.

Special: A character can [take 10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) when making a Perform check, but can’t [take 20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index).

A character without an appropriate [instrument](modern-d20-srd-equipment-professional-equipment) automatically fails any Perform (keyboard), Perform
(percussion), Perform (stringed), or Perform (wind) check he or she attempts.
At the GM’s discretion, impromptu instruments may be employed, but the
performer must take a –4 penalty on the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) because his or her equipment, although usable,
is inappropriate for the skill.

Every time a character takes the [Creative](modern-d20-srd-feats-creative)
feat, he or she gets a +2 bonus on checks involving two Perform skills the
character designates. See the [feat description](modern-d20-srd-feats-creative) for more information.

Time: A Perform [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) usually requires at least several minutes to an hour or more.
