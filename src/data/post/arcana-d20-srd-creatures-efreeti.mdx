## 
     Efreeti
    



     An efreeti typically uses its polymorph ability to conceal its true form: that of a 12-foot-tall giant with brick-red skin, fiery eyes, small horns, and jutting tusks. The average efreeti weighs about 2,000 pounds. Efreet read, write, and speak Auran, Ignan, and Infernal, and one or more common or local languages.
    


### 
     Species Traits
    



     Efreet have the following traits:
    



     Heat (Ex): An efreeti deals 1d6 points of additional fire damage whenever it hits in melee or each round it maintains a hold while grappling.
    



     Spell-like Abilities: 1/daydetect magical aura, gaseous form, invisibility, wall of fire (save DC 16). These abilities are as the spells cast by a 10th-level Mage (save DC 12 + spell level). The DCs are Charisma-based.
    



     Polymorph (Sp): An efreeti can cast polymorph, at will, as a move action. This ability is similar to the polymorph incantation except that no skill checks or components are required, the efreeti cannot transform any creature other than itself, and the efreeti can remain in its new form indefinitely.
    



     Grant Wishes (Sp): Some efreeti (1% of the total population) are noble and can grant up to three wishes to any being (non-genies only) who captures them.
Noble efreet perform no other services and, upon granting the third wish, are free of their servitude. Whenever possible, an efreeti will twist the words of a wish to bring pain and destruction upon the wisher. A wish can produce any one of the following effects, at the GMs discretion:
    


- 
      Duplicate any spell, psionic power, or incantation (including raise dead).
     
- 
      Undo the harmful effects of a spell, psionic power, or incantation.

- 
      Remove all injuries and afflictions affecting one creature.
     
- 
      Transport a number of creatures equal to the efreetis Hit Dice to any place the wisher chooses.

      Undo a single recent event.
