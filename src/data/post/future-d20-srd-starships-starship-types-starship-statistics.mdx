    Starship Statistics




    This chapter includes ready-to-use statistics for various starship subtypes. These statistics represent baseline models only. A starships statistics and performance can be improved by upgrading its weapons, armor, shields, defensive systems, and engines.




    Each starship description includes the following statistics.




    Type: The starships type (ultralight, light, mediumweight, heavy, or superheavy) determines its fighting space on the battle grid.




    Subtype: The starships subtype describes the ships primary function (for example, fighter or strike cruiser).




    Defense: A starships Defense determines how hard the ship is to hit. A starships flat-footed Defense does not include the pilots Dexterity modifier. A starships autopilot Defense is used when the ships autopilot system is engaged.




    Hardness: A ships hardness is determined by its armor. Hardness reduces the amount of damage the ship takes from weapon attacks. Better armor can improve a ships hardness.




    Hit Dice: A ships Hit Dice (HD) determines how many hit points it has. Hit Dice are never rolled to determine a ships hit points; the ship always gets maximum hit points for each Hit Die.




    Initiative Modifier: A starships initiative modifier is equal to the pilots Dexterity modifier, with a +4 bonus if the pilot has the Improved Initiative feat.




    Pilots Class Bonus: The pilots class bonus to Defense applies to the starships normal and flat-footed Defense.




    Pilots Dex Modifier: The pilots Dexterity modifier applies to the starships Defense, except when the ship is flat-footed or grappled.




    Gunners Attack Bonus: The gunners attack bonus applies to ranged weapon attacks.




    Size: The ships size affects its Defense, weapon attack rolls, and grapple modifier.




    Tactical Speed: Tactical speed represents how far the starship can move as a move action using its thrusters. Speed is listed in feet and squares. Most starships have a base tactical speed of 3,000 feet. Better engines can improve a starships tactical speed (see Starship Engines), while heavier armor can reduce a ships tactical speed (see Starship Armor,).




    Length: The ships length in feet.




    Weight: The ships weight in pounds or tons.




    Targeting System Bonus: The ships computerized targeting system provides an equipment bonus on a gunners attack rolls and a similar equipment bonus on attack rolls made by the ships point-efense system (see Attack of Opportunity, below). This equipment bonus is already factored in to the ships attack statistics.




    Crew: The ships standard crew complement is given here. A ship cannot operate with less than one-quarter of its standard crew complement. The crews quality is given in parentheses, along with the crews modifier to skill checks (including Pilot checks made to avoid hazards). The quality of the crew determines the pilots class bonus to Defense, the pilots Dexterity modifier, and the gunners attack bonus (see Table: Crew Quality for details).




    Passenger Capacity: The maximum number of passengers that can be safely lodged aboard the ship.




    Cargo Capacity: The maximum tonnage of cargo that the ship can store in its holds.




    Grapple Modifier: The ships grapple check modifier is based on its size (Huge +8, Gargantuan +12, Colossal +16). Grapple checks come into play whenever grapplers and tractor beams are used (see Grappling Systems).




    Base Purchase DC: The base purchase DC includes the ships hull and a trained crew, but not its engines, armor, shields, defensive systems, sensor systems, comm systems, weapons, or grappling systems (which must be purchased separately).




    Restriction: The ships restriction rating.




    Attack: This line shows the ranged weapon attacks a starship typically makes when it uses an attack action.




    Attack of Opportunity: If the ship has a point-defense system installed, it threatens ships passing through its fighting space or adjacent squares. Use the line to resolve attacks of opportunity made by the ship.




    Standard Design Specs: The ships engines, armor, defensive systems, sensors, communications, weapons, and grappling systems are listed here.

    Improving A StarshipS Statistics




    The starship statistics presented below use standard design specs appropriate for the lowest Progress Level at which these ships can be played (PL 6 or PL 7 for most ships). Improving a starships statistics requires upgrades to its crew, armor, defensive systems, sensor systems, and/or weapons, as discussed throughout this chapter.
