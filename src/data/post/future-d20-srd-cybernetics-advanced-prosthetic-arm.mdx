    Advanced Prosthetic Arm (PL 7)




    This upgraded version of the PL 5 prosthetic arm and PL 6 upgrade not only replaces a lost or destroyed arm but is also more resilient and less impairing than its technological predecessors.

    Type: External.




    Hardness/Hit Points: 5/10.




    Base Purchase DC: 22.




    Restriction: None.
