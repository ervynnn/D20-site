## Spells

Hit Dice: The term “Hit Dice” is used synonymously with “character levels” for
effects that affect a number of Hit Dice of creatures. A creature with only
Hit Dice from its species, not from any classes it may have, has a character
level equal to its Hit Dice. A creature with class levels is considered to
have Hit Dice equal to the total of its Hit Dice and its class levels.

Caster [Level](modern-d20-srd-fx-level): A spell’s power often depends on
caster level, which is the caster’s level in the appropriate spellcasting
class. Creatures with no classes have a caster level equal to their Hit Dice
unless otherwise specified.

Creatures and Characters: “Creatures” and “characters” are used synonymously
in the spell descriptions.

List Format: Spells in the following lists are presented in order of spell
level (from lowest to highest) and alphabetized within each level group. A
brief description of the spell’s effect is provided.
