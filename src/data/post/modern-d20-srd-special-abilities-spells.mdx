    or

    ](modern-d20-srd-fx-items-index)
    accordingly). These creatures are subject to the same spellcasting rules as characters.

    unless their entries say so, and they do not gain any class features. A creature with access to

     divine
  spells
    ](modern-d20-srd-fx-divine-spells)
    must prepare them in the normal manner.
