## 
    Quadrupedal Mecha
   



    Mecha can be built with four legs instead of two. A quadrupedal mecha sacrifices equipment slots for added speed and stability. Its base land speed increases by 10 feet, and it gains a +4 stability bonus on checks made to resist bull rush and trip attempts.
   



    A Large quadrupedal mecha has 6 equipment slots instead of 7, giving up its boots slot.
   



    A Huge quadrupedal mecha has 8 equipment slots instead of 11, giving up both hand slots (left and right) and its boots slot.
   



    A Gargantuan quadrupedal mecha has 14 equipment slots instead of 17, giving up both hand slots (left and right) and its boots slot.
   



    A Colossal quadrupedal mecha has 22 equipment slots instead of 25, giving up both hand slots (left and right) and its boots slot.
