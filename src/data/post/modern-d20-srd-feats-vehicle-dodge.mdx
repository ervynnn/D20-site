## Vehicle Dodge

Prerequisites: [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) 13, [Drive](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive) 6 ranks or [Pilot](modern-d20-srd-skills-pilot) 6 ranks, [Vehicle Expert](modern-d20-srd-feats-vehicle-expert).

Benefit: When driving a vehicle, during the character’s action the character designates an opposing vehicle or a single opponent. The character’s vehicle and everyone aboard it receive a +1 dodge bonus to [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) against attacks from that vehicle or opponent. The character can select a new vehicle or opponent on any action.
