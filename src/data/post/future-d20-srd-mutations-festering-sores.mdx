## Festering Sores [DRAWBACK]


Your skin is covered with painful, festering sores.


MP Value: 2.


Drawback: The festering sores are more aggravating than harmful, but they make it especially hard to wear armor. When you wear any type of armor, decrease the armor's maximum Dexterity bonus by '2 and increase its armor penalty by +4.
