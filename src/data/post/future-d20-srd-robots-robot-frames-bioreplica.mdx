## Bioreplica (PL 7)


A step up from biodroids, bioreplicas are robots so convincingly lifelike that they are virtually indistinguishable from their living counterparts. The bioreplica's components are made up of lightweight plastics in a synthetic sheath that looks and feels like real flesh and skin. Bioreplicants are restricted, and in some areas, buying or owning one is illegal.


To build a bioreplica frame from scratch, a character must succeed at two skill checksa Craft (mechanical) check (DC 30) and a Craft (electronic) check (DC 30). These checks are made after investing time in the frame's construction: 48 hours for a Large or smaller frame or 72 hours for a Huge or larger frame. A character without a mechanical tool kit or electrical tool kit takes a '4 penalty on the skill check ('8 if the character has neither). The character must also make a Wealth check against the frame's purchase DC.


Table: Bioreplica Robot Frames provides the base purchase DC, Hit Dice, and ability scores for factory-model bioreplica robots, as well as purchase DC modifiers for improving ability scores.


Critical Systems: Although they are constructs, bioreplicas have vital areas and critical systems. Consequently, they are subject to critical hits.


Lifelike Appearance: Distinguishing a bioreplica from members of its emulated species requires a successful Spot check (DC 20). A bioreplica can use the Disguise skill to increase the Spot check DC.


Restriction: Restricted (+2) or Illegal (+4).
