## Nerve Pinch


You can incapacitate foes with a vicelike pinch.


Prerequisites: Combat Martial Arts, base attack bonus +4.


Benefit: You make an unarmed attack against a living creature. If the attack succeeds, the target takes no damage but must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + one-half your character level + your Strength modifier) or be paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds. If the targets attack of opportunity hits you and deals damage, the nerve pinch automatically fails.


Special: This ability does not work on creatures without nervous systems or discernible anatomies, such as oozes and plants.
