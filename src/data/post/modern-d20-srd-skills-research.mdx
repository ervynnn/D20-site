##  Research ( [ Int ](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) )

[ Check ](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) :
Researching a topic takes time, skill, and some luck. The GM determines how
obscure a particular topic is (the more obscure, the higher the DC) and what
kind of information might be available depending on where the character is
conducting his or her research.

Information ranges from general to protected. Given enough time (usually 1d4
hours) and a successful skill [ check ](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) , the character gets a general idea about a given
topic. This assumes that no obvious reasons exist why such information would
be unavailable, and that the character has a way to acquire restricted or
protected information.

The higher the [ check ](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) result, the better and more complete the information. If the character
wants to discover a specific fact, date, map, or similar bit of information,
add +5 to +15 to the DC.

Try Again?: Yes.

Special: A character can [ take 10 ](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) or [ take 20 ](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index) on a Research [ check ](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) .

A character with the [ Studious ](modern-d20-srd-feats-studious) feat gets a
+2 bonus on all Research [ checks ](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) .

[ Computer Use ](modern-d20-srd-skills-computer-use) can provide a +2 [synergy bonus ](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-synergy-index) on
a Research [ check ](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index)
when searching computer records for data (see [ Skill Synergy](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-synergy-index) ).

Time: A Research [ check ](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) takes 1d4 hours.
