     Starting Wealth Bonus




     A character who begins play as a newly arrived Shadowkind has a starting Wealth bonus of +2 to +12 (roll 2d6). However, the character must spend this entire Wealth bonus on personal gear typical of a medieval fantasy character (such as archaic weapons and armor). Any portion of the characters Wealth bonus that goes unspent is lost; in effect, the character begins play with some primitive personal items and equipment and a starting Wealth bonus of +0.




     Shadowkind characters born and raised in our world follow the normal rules for determining Wealth bonus.
