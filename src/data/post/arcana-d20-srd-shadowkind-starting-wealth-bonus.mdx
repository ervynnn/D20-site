##  Starting Wealth Bonus

A character who begins play as a newly arrived Shadowkind has a starting
Wealth bonus of +2 to +12 (roll 2d6). However, the character must spend this
entire Wealth bonus on personal gear typical of a medieval fantasy character
(such as archaic weapons and armor). Any portion of the characterâ€™s Wealth
bonus that goes unspent is lost; in effect, the character begins play with
some primitive personal items and equipment and a starting Wealth bonus of +0.

Shadowkind characters born and raised in our world follow the normal rules for
determining Wealth bonus.
