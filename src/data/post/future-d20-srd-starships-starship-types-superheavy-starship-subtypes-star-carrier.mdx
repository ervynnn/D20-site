## 
     Star Carrier (PL 7)
    



     A larger version of the fleet carrier, the star carrier serves as a mobile base for smaller craft. A star carrier's fighting space takes up 36 500- foot squares (a 6-square-by-6-square area).
    



     In addition to its normal cargo capacity, a star carrier can hold 72 fighters or assault fighters. Its listed crew complement does not include the ace pilots who fly these fighter craft. (Pilots count against the passenger capacity.) A star carrier can deploy up to 8 ultralight craft as a move action.
