     Doom Hag




     Standing 6 feet tall and weighing 175 pounds, a doom hag resembles a grizzled crone. It is always clad in a shabby, tattered dress and shawl of a drab color.

###

     Species Traits




     Confusion (Sp): A doom hag can use confusion three times per day, as the spell cast by a 9th-level Mage (Will save negates; save DC 14 + the doom hags Charisma modifier).




     Mimicry (Ex): A doom hag can imitate (but not necessarily understand) the sounds made by any person or animal it hears.




     Natural Invisibility (Su): During daylight, a doom hag is naturally invisible and remains so even when attacking. Any creature that correctly discerns the doom hags location despite being unable to see it has a 50% miss chance on melee and ranged attacks. This ability is always active, but the doom hag can suppress it for 1 round with a successful Concentration check (DC 15). A new check at the same DC is required for each subsequent round that it wishes to remain visible. The doom hag is visible from sundown to sunup.




     Rend (Ex): If a doom hag hits with both claw attacks, it latches onto the opponents body and tears the flesh. The rending attack deals damage as a claw attack plus 1.5 times the doom hags Strength modifier.




     Skill Bonus: A doom hag blends into the gloom, gaining a +4 species bonus on Hide checks at night or in darkness.




     Undead: A doom hag has the traits and immunities common to undead.
