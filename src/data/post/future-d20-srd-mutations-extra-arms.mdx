## Extra Arms [MAJOR]


You grow an additional pair of arms. The extra arms look and behave exactly like your other arms.


MP Cost: 6.


Benefit: As a creature with more than two arms, you gain a +4 mutation bonus on Climb checks and grapple checks. For the purposes of combat, both extra arms are treated as off hands (that is, you still have only one primary hand).


Special: If you have three or more natural claw attacks, you meet the prerequisites for the Multiattack feat. This mutation does not give you Multiattack as a bonus feat, however.
