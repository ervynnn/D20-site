## 
     Mothfolk
    



     Mothfolk appear as tall, lanky humanoids covered in short, dark fur. Their large wings have a wingspread of over 20 feet. Their most arresting features are their eyes: large, red, and luminescent, and occasionally described as looking like oversized bicycle reflectors.
    


### 
     Species Traits
    



     Automatic Language: Mothfolk read, write, and speak a language of whistles, squeaks, and clicks (called Mothfolk, for lack of a better name).
    



     Fear Aura (Su): A mothfolk projects an aura of fear around itself in a 20-foot radius. Creatures within this area that wish to remain must attempt a Will save (DC 10 + ½ the mothmans Hit Dice + its Charisma modifier) or be affected as by a fear spell. A mothfolk is immune to the fear auras of other mothfolk.
