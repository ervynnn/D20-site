##  Mothfolk

Mothfolk appear as tall, lanky humanoids covered in short, dark fur. Their
large wings have a wingspread of over 20 feet. Their most arresting features
are their eyes: large, red, and luminescent, and occasionally described as
looking like oversized bicycle reflectors.

###  Species Traits

Automatic Language: Mothfolk read, write, and speak a language of whistles,
squeaks, and clicks (called Mothfolk, for lack of a better name).

Fear Aura (Su): A mothfolk projects an aura of fear around itself in a 20-foot
radius. Creatures within this area that wish to remain must attempt a Will
save (DC 10 + ½ the mothman’s Hit Dice + its Charisma modifier) or be affected
as by a fear spell. A mothfolk is immune to the fear auras of other mothfolk.

Skill Bonuses: Mothfolk gain a +4 species bonus on Balance, Climb, Listen, and
Move Silently checks.
