## Puppeteer

### Species Traits

Combined Challenge Rating: The Challenge Rating of a puppeteer with a host is equal to the host’s Challenge Rating +1.

Glide (Sp): A puppeteer can glide through the air at a speed of 20 feet for up to 16 minutes at a time, with poor maneuverability. The puppeteer cannot manifest [psionic powers](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index) while gliding.

Psionics (Sp): 3/day—[brain lock](modern-d20-srd-psionics-brain-lock), [lesser domination](modern-d20-srd-psionics-lesser-domination). These abilities are as the psionic powers of an 8th-level manifester.

Thrall (Sp): If a puppeteer successfully uses [lesser domination](modern-d20-srd-psionics-lesser-domination) on its host seven times, the final effect is permanent, bonding the host to the puppeteer. The thralled host will carry out the orders of the puppeteer, including self-destructive orders. Actions against the host’s original nature allow the host a [Will save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) (DC 22) to resist, with a –10 penalty on the roll. A successful save negates that particular action (or future occurrences of that action), but the host remains the puppeteer’s thrall.

Shared Host (Ex): When multiple puppeteers prey on a single host, the blood drain can be too great for the host to bear. The extensive blood drain deals 1 point of temporary [Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) damage per day, and a host reduced to 0 Constitution in this fashion dies. The minimum number of puppeteers needed to cause temporary [Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) damage depends on the host’s size: Diminutive 2, Tiny 4, Small 12, Medium-size 20, Large 30, Gargantuan 50, Colossal 90.

[Blindsight](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-blindsight) (Ex): A puppeteer can ascertain creatures by nonvisual means within 60 feet. The puppeteer confers [blindsight](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-blindsight) upon its host.

Host Protection (Ex): An attached puppeteer uses its host’s base [saving throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) bonuses if they’re better than its own. Effects that target [vermin](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-vermin) can’t
affect a puppeteer riding a humanoid host.

Immunities: Puppeteers are immune to mind-influencing effects. This ability is conferred upon the puppeteer’s host as well.

Resistance to [Massive Damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-death-dying-healing) (Ex): Puppeteers gain a +5 species bonus on [Fortitude saves](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) to negate the effects of [massive damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-death-dying-healing). This ability is conferred upon the puppeteer’s host as well.

Shared [Skills](modern-d20-srd-skills-index): The puppeteer retains its skills when it takes a host. The host gains a +4 bonus on [Listen](modern-d20-srd-skills-listen) and [Spot](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot) checks.
