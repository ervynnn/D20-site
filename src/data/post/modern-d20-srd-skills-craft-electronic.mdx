## Craft (Electronic) (Int) Trained Only

This skill allows a character to build [electronic equipment](modern-d20-srd-equipment-surveillance-gear) from scratch, such as audio and video equipment, timers and listening devices, or radios and communication devices.

When building an electronic device from scratch, the character describes the kind of device he or she wants to construct; then the Gamemaster decides whether the device is simple, moderate, complex, or advanced compared to current technology.

| Type of Scratch-Built Electronics (Examples)       | Purchase DC | Craft DC |   Time |
| :------------------------------------------------- | :---------: | :------: | -----: |
| Simple (timer or detonator)                        |      8      |    15    |  1 hr. |
| Moderate (radio direction finder, electronic lock) |     12      |    20    | 12 hr. |
| Complex (cell phone)                               |     16      |    25    | 24 hr. |
| Advanced (computer)                                |     22      |    30    | 60 hr. |

Special: A character without an [electrical tool kit](modern-d20-srd-equipment-professional-equipment) takes a 4 penalty on Craft (electronic) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

A character with the [Builder](modern-d20-srd-feats-builder) feat gets a +2 bonus on all Craft (electronic) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).
