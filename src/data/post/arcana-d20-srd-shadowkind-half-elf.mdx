##  Half-Elf

Size: Medium. Half-elves have no special bonuses or penalties due to their
size.

Elven Blood: For all effects related to species, a half-elf is considered an
elf. Half-elves, for example, are just as susceptible to special effects that
affect elves as their elven ancestors are, and they can use magic items that
are only usable by elves.

gain a +2 species bonus on saves against Enchantment spells or effects.

Low-Light Vision: Half-elves can see twice as far as a human in starlight,
moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. They
retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.

checks. They gain a +2 species bonus on Diplomacy and Gather Information
checks.
