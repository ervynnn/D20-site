## Fear

An invisible cone of terror causes living creatures to become panicked. They
suffer a –2 morale penalty on [saving throws](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws), and they flee from the caster. A panicked creature has a 50% chance
to drop what it’s holding, chooses its path randomly (as long as it is getting
away from immediate danger), and flees any other dangers that confront it. If
cornered, a panicked creature cowers. A cowering creature loses its
[Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) bonus, can take no actions,
and takes a –2 penalty to its [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense).
