## Psionic Powers

A psionic power is a one-time psionic effect manifested by a psionic character
or creature. Psionic powers require power points to use, although naturally
psionic creatures can manifest their powers a certain number of times per day
with no power point cost.

Each psionic power is tied to a specific [ability](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores), which is the [key ability](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) for that psionic power. A psionic character must have a [key ability](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) score equal to at least 10 +
the power’s level to manifest a particular power.

Unlike [arcane spellcasters](modern-d20-srd-fx-arcane-spells), psionic
characters don’t have spellbooks and they don’t prepare their powers ahead of
time. A psionic character’s level limits the number of power points available
for manifesting powers. A psionic character has a set number of powers
available that he may manifest at will, provided he has sufficient power
points to pay for the manifestation.

A power manifests when the psionic character pays its power point cost. The
character pays the cost, and the power manifests immediately.

Psionic powers don’t require special gestures, words, or materials. They
operate as thoughts made manifest. Most powers do have a noticeable display
associated with their use, however.

###  Power Points

A power’s cost is determined by its level, as shown below. Every power’s cost
is also noted in its description for easy reference.


<table> <tr><th>Power Level</th> <td>0</td> <td>1</td> <td>2</td> <td>3</td> <td>4</td> <td>5</td> </tr><tr> <th>Power point cost</th> <td>0/1*</td> <td>1</td> <td>3</td> <td>5</td> <td>7</td> <td>9</td> </tr><tr><td colspan="7" style="text-align: left; font-size: .8em;"> *A psionic character can manifest any 0-level power he or she knows a number of times per day equal to 3 + his or her psionic level; additional manifestations cost 1 power point each. </td></tr> </table>


### Key Ability

The first line beneath the power’s name provides the [key ability](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) associated with the power. A
psionic character must have a score in this ability equal to at least 10 + the
power’s level in order to manifest the power.

###  Descriptors

Descriptors are a way of classifying powers that have some common
characteristic. Descriptors are often useful for knowing which creatures are
or are not affected by a power. A power’s descriptors (if any) appear in
brackets on the line containing the key ability. Descriptors for powers
include compulsion, electricity, fire, language-dependent, and mind-affecting.

###  Level

The relative strength of a power is indicated by its level. A power’s level
also indicates whether a particular psionic character is capable of using the
power, based on the character’s class level and [key ability](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) score.

###  Display

When psionic powers manifest, secondary displays usually accompany the primary
effect. The psionic display may be auditory (Au), material (Ma), mental (Me),
olfactory (Ol), or visual (Vi). Each power describes the sort of display that
accompanies it.

###  Manifestation Time

Manifesting a psionic power is either an [attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) or a [full-round action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions), depending on the power. See the power descriptions for
details.

###  Range

Each psionic power has a range, as listed in the power description. A power’s
range is the maximum distance from the psionic character that the power’s
effect can occur. The range categories are the same as the ones used for
spells.

###  Target, Effect, Area

These terms are defined and used the same as they are for spells.

###  [Saving Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)

Most harmful powers allow an affected target a [saving throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) to avoid some or all of the effect. Each power lists
which saving throw type applies. The DC for a saving throw to resist a power
is 10 + the power’s level + the psionic character’s [key ability](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier. The terms used to
define the various types of [saving throws](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) and results are the same as for spells.

###  [Power Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-power-resistance)

[Power resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-power-resistance) is a
special defensive ability that protects against psionic powers. If a psionic
character faces a creature with [power resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-power-resistance), he or she must make a level check (1d20 + psionic
character’s class level) equal to or greater than the creature’s [power resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-power-resistance) for the power
to affect it.

Each power description includes an entry that indicates whether [power resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-power-resistance) applies to the
power (if so, Yes; if not, No). Other details are the same as for [spell resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance).

###  Power Point Cost

All powers of a certain level have the same power point cost. The point cost
to manifest a particular power is also provided in that power’s description.

###  Descriptive Text

A power’s descriptive text explains how the power works or what it does.

###  Power Failure

If a character tries to manifest a power in conditions where the
characteristics of the spell (range, area, and so forth) cannot be made to
conform, the effort fails and the power is wasted.

Powers also fail if the character’s [concentration](modern-d20-srd-skills-concentration) is broken (see the [Concentration](modern-d20-srd-skills-concentration) skill).

###  How to Read a Power Description

In most significant respects, manifesting a psionic power follows the same
rules as [casting a spell](modern-d20-srd-fx-index). The differences between a
power description and a spell description are summarized in this section. See
[How to Read a Spell Description](modern-d20-srd-fx-index), for information
that is the same for both psionic powers and spells.

###  Power Lists

This section begins with the power lists for psionic character classes.

Hit Dice: The term “Hit Dice” is used synonymously with “character levels” for
effects that affect a number of Hit Dice of creatures. A creature with only
Hit Dice from its species, not from any classes it may have, has a character
level equal to its Hit Dice. A creature with class levels is considered to
have Hit Dice equal to the total of its Hit Dice and its class levels.

Manifester Level: A power’s strength often depends on manifester level, which
is the manifester’s level in the appropriate psionic character class.
Creatures with no classes have a manifester level equal to their Hit Dice
unless otherwise specified.

Creatures and Characters: “Creatures” and “characters” are used synonymously
in the power descriptions.

List Format: Powers in the following lists are presented in order of power
level (from lowest to highest) and alphabetized within each level group. A
brief description of the power’s effect is provided. Also, each power’s [key ability](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) is identified in parentheses
right after its name.
