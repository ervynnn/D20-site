## Magic Items and Mundanes

For the most part, magic items won’t function for a mundane. Sure, the mundane
might feel joy and attachement to such an item, or perhaps fear and loathing,
depending on the person and the function of the item, but rarely does a
mundane recognize and understand as such an item for what it truly is. Most of
the world doesn’t believe in magic or the supernatural. So, for these people,
a magic item that actually operates while in their possession is either seen
as a trick or a special effect, or the person convinces himself that he didn’t
really see what he thinks he just saw. In some cases, such an event might
disturb a mundane to such an extent that psychological harm occurs.
