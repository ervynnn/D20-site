## Beam Weapons


Beam weapons deal energy damage, usually of a nonspecific type. They range from weapons as simple as a high-powered laser to monstrous devices capable of harnessing the fundamental forces of the universe.


Beam weapons draw power from a starship's power plant and are considered to have unlimited ammunition.


Beam Weapon Mounts: Beam weapons are mounted on turrets or in banks that, coupled with the starship's ability to adjust its orientation, allow the weapons to fire in any direction. The cost of a turret mount or bank is included in the purchase DC of the weapon.
