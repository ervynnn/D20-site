## Mutation Points


Mutation Points (MP) provide a simple method of selecting mutations while preserving game balance. All creatures (including heroes) begin play with 0 MP. A creature gains MP by selecting one or more drawbacksphysical deformities and disabilities that make the creature less effective in play. A creature can then spend the MP on one or more beneficial mutations. The total MP spent on beneficial mutations cannot exceed the total MP the creature gains from drawbacks. A creature may still have unspent MP after choosing beneficial mutations, however. These unspent MP can be spent on new mutations at a later time.

### Hiding Physical Deformities


Many mutations come with physical deformities. Some mutations are easy to hide, while others are harder to conceal.


Any mutation that alters a creature's physical appearance imposes a penalty on the creature's Disguise checks. For creatures trying to conceal multiple physical deformities or alterations, the penalties stack. A cosmetic mutation imposes a '1 penalty on Disguise checks, while a minor or major mutation imposes a '2 penalty on Disguise checks. Drawbacks do not apply penalties to Disguise checks.
