## Sensors


Robots are unable to perceive their surroundings without a sensor system of some kind. Without sensors, they are effectively blind and deaf, and they suffer penalties on certain checksÂ—if they can attempt them at all.


Sight: A robot without visual sensors suffers a '4 penalty on all skill checks and cannot make Spot checks.


Sound: A robot without audio sensors suffers a '2 penalty on all skill checks and cannot make Listen checks.


Touch: A robot without tactile sensors suffers a '4 penalty on all Demolitions, Disable Device, Forgery, and Repair checks.


Smell: A robot without olfactory sensors suffers no particular penalties.


Taste: A robot without gustatory sensors suffers no particular penalties.


To build a sensor system from scratch, a character must succeed at a Craft (electrical) check (DC 30) after investing 60 hours in its assembly. A character without an electrical tool kit takes a '4 penalty on the skill check. The character must also make a Wealth check against the sensor system's purchase DC.


Robot sensor systems are further separated by type and purchase DC:


Type: The type of sensors (visual, audio, tactile, olfactory, gustatory) included in the system.


Purchase DC: The cost of the sensor system.


Restriction: A sensor system does not require a special license to purchase.
