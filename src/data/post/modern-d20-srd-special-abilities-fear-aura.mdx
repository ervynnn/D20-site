## Fear Aura (Su)

A fear aura either operates continuously or can be used at will. In either case, it’s a [free action](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types). This ability can freeze an opponent or cause opponents to become [panicked](modern-d20-srd-conditions-index). Other effects are possible. Negating the fear effect requires a successful [Will save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 fearsome creature’s HD + fearsome creature’s [Charisma modifier](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) (the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text).
