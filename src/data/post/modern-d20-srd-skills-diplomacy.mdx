## Diplomacy ([Cha](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores))

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): A character
can change others’ attitudes with a successful [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (see the table below. In negotiations,
participants roll opposed Diplomacy [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) to see who gains the advantage. Opposed
[checks](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check) also resolve cases where two
advocates or diplomats plead opposing cases before a third party.

Diplomacy can be used to influence a GM character’s attitude. The GM chooses
the character’s initial attitude based on circumstances. Most of the time, the
people the heroes meet are indifferent toward them, but a specific situation
may call for a different initial attitude. The DCs given in the accompanying
table show what it takes to change someone’s attitude with the use of the
Diplomacy skill. The character doesn’t declare a specific outcome he or she is
trying for; instead, make the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) and compare the result to the table on the next page.

Try Again?: Generally, trying again doesn’t work. Even if the initial check
succeeds, the other character can only be persuaded so far. If the initial
check fails, the other character has probably become more firmly committed to
his or her position, and trying again is futile.

Special: A character can [take 10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) when making a Diplomacy check, but can’t [take 20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index).

A character with the [Trustworthy](modern-d20-srd-feats-trustworthy) feat gets
a +2 bonus on all Diplomacy [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

Time: Diplomacy is at least a [full-round action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions). The GM may determine that some negotiations require a longer
period of time.

Offering money or another form of favor can, in the right situation, improve a
character’s chances with a Diplomacy skill [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). Bribery allows a character to circumvent
various official obstacles when a person in a position of trust or authority
is willing to accept such an offering.

An illegal act, bribery requires two willing participants—one to offer a bribe
and the other to accept it. When a character requires a bribe to render
services, then a hero’s Diplomacy [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) automatically fails if a bribe isn’t attached to it. If
a bribe isn’t required, a hero can add a bribe to get a bonus on his or her
skill [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). This
can backfire, as some characters will be insulted by a bribe offer (their
attitude changes one step for the worse) and others will report the hero to
the proper authorities.

To bribe a character, make a [Wealth check](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check). Typical DCs are shown on below, but the GM may modify the DC as he or
she sees fit. If the hero succeeds in the [check](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check), he or she gains a +2 bonus on the Diplomacy
[check](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-general). For every point by which
the hero beats the DC, increase the bonus by +1 (to a total maximum bonus of
+10).
