## Feat Web (PL 8)


A feat web allows a robot with ordinary class levels to gain feats as normal for its class. The feat web expands as the robot advances in level. An integral component of the robot, it cannot be salvaged if the droid is destroyed.


A feat web's feats cannot be altered except through level advancement.


Purchase DC: 10 + one-half the base purchase DC of the robot's frame.
