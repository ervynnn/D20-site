## Craft (Int)

This skill encompasses several categories, each of them treated as a separate skill: [Craft (chemical)](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft-chemical), [Craft (electronic)](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft-electronic), [Craft (mechanical)](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft-mechanical), [Craft (pharmaceutical)](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft-pharmaceutical), [Craft (structural)](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft-structural), [Craft (visual arts)](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft-visual-art), and [Craft (writing)](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft-writing).

Craft skills are specifically focused on creating objects. To use a Craft skill effectively, a character must have a [kit](modern-d20-srd-equipment-professional-equipment) or some other set of [basic tools](modern-d20-srd-equipment-professional-equipment). The purchase DC of this equipment varies according to the particular Craft skill.

To use Craft, first decide what the character is trying to make and consult the category descriptions below. Make a [Wealth check](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check) against the given purchase DC for the object to see if the character succeeds in acquiring the raw materials. If the character succeeds at that [check](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check), make the Craft [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) against the given DC for the object in question. If the character fails the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), he or she does not make the object, and the raw materials are wasted (unless otherwise noted).

Generally, a character can [take 10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) when using a Craft skill to construct an object, but can’t [take 20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index) (since doing so represents multiple attempts, and the character uses up the raw materials after the first attempt). The exception is [Craft (writing)](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft-writing); a character can [take 20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index) because the character does not use up any raw materials (and thus no [Wealth check](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check) is required to use the skill).
