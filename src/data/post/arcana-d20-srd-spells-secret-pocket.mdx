## Secret Pocket

Conjuration (Summoning)

Level: Arcane 3, Divine 3; Components: V, S, M/DF; Casting Time: Attack
action; Range: Object touched; Target: One pocket on a garment; Duration: 1
hour/level; Saving Throw: None; Spell Resistance: No

The secret pocket spell creates an extradimensional space that only you can
reach through a pocket in the target garment. The secret pocket can hold 1
pound per caster level, and you can put anything in it that will physical fit
through the pocket opening. The item can be of any length and isn’t otherwise
restricted by the pocket’s actual dimensions—it just has to be able to fit
through the opening. The contents of the extradimensional space never cause
the pocket to bulge, and items inside the secret pocket have no weight once
they’re placed inside (although the weight still counts against the capacity
of the extradimensional space). Whenever you reach into the pocket, you access
the extradimensional space rather than the actual pocket. Anyone else who
examines the pocket finds it completely ordinary. If someone else puts
something in the pocket, you can’t reach it because your hand goes into the
extradimensional space instead.

You can give the garment to someone else to wear if you like, but only you can
access the extradimensional space through the pocket.

Arcane Material Component: A black handkerchief.
