## Something From Nothing


Almost incomprehensible to modern science, one final means of replication should also be considered. Creating an object literally from nothing is a concept that cannot fit into modern scientific understanding. The laws of conservation of energy and the idea that there is a finite amount of matter in the universe dictate that creating an object without a basic set of materials is impossible. However, some incredibly advanced societies may be able to do just that, and matter replication without a basic material like protomatter might be entirely feasibly and evidence of how far that societyâ€™s technology is beyond all others.
