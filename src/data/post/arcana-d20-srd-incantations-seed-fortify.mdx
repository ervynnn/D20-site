## 
     Seed: Fortify
    



     Transmutation
    



     Knowledge (arcane lore) DC: 30; Range: Touch; Target: Creature touched; Duration: Hours; Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless); Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)
    



     Incantations using the fortify seed grant a +1 enhancement bonus to whichever one of the following you choose:
    


- 
      Any one ability score.
     
- 
      Any one kind of saving throw.
     
- 
      Spell resistance.
     
- 
      Natural armor bonus.
     



     The fortify seed can also grant energy resistance 1 for one energy type or 1 temporary hit point. For each additional +1 bonus, point of energy resistance, or hit point, increase the Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by +2.
    



     The fortify seed has a base Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC is 34 if it grants a +1 bonus of a type other than enhancement (such as luck or insight). For each additional +1 bonus of a type other than enhancement, increase the Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by +4. If you apply a factor to make the duration permanent, the bonus must be an inherent bonus, and the maximum inherent bonus allowed is +5.
    



     The fortify seed can also grant SR 22, and each additional point of spell resistance increases the Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by +4 (each 1 to spell resistance reduces the Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by 2). If an incantation with the fortify seed grants an inanimate object an ability score it wouldnt normally possess (such as Intelligence), the incantation must also incorporate the life seed.
    



     The fortify seed can also grant damage reduction 10/+1. For each additional point of damage reduction, increase the Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by +1. For each additional point of required weapon enhancement above +1, increase the Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by +3.
