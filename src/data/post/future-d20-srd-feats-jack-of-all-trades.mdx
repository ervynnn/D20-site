## Jack Of All Trades


You've picked up a smattering of even the most obscure skills.


Prerequisite: Character level 8th+.


Benefit: You can use any skill untrained, even those that normally require training and those that are exclusive to classes you don't have. You cannot, however, gain ranks in a skill unless you are allowed to select it.
