##  Spell Immunity

Abjuration

Level: Divine 4; Components: V, S, DF; Casting Time: Attack action; Range:
Touch; Target: Creature touched; Duration: 10 minutes/level; Saving Throw:
Will negates (harmless); Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

The warded creature is immune to the effects of one specified spell for every
four levels you have. The spells must be of 4th level or lower. The warded
creature effectively has unbeatable spell resistance regarding the specified
spell or spells. Naturally, such immunity doesn’t protect a creature from
spells for which spell resistance doesn’t apply.

Spell immunity protects against spells, spell-like effects of magic items, and
innate spell-like abilities of creatures. It does not protect against
supernatural or extraordinary abilities, such as breath weapons or gaze
attacks. Only a particular spell can be protected against, not a school of
spells or a group of spells that are similar in effect.

A creature can have only one spell immunity spell in effect on it at a time.
