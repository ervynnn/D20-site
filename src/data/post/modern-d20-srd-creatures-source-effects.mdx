## Source Effects

After determining a creature’s source of weakness, the GM needs to decide how
the creature reacts when confronted by the source. Pick an effect that seems
appropriate for the creature and the source.

A creature gets either a Fortitude or Will saving throw to overcome or resist
the source of weakness; the DC of the save varies depending on the source’s
strength:


<table><tr><th> Strength of Source</th><th> Save DC </th></tr> <tr><td> Easily resistible</td><td> 10 </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td>Moderate</td><td> 15 </td></tr> <tr><td>Strong</td><td> 20 </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td>Overpowering</td><td> 25 </td></tr></table>



Creatures usually react to a source of weakness in one of six ways:

Addiction: The creature is compelled to ingest, imbibe, or inhale the source.
The source must be within 5 feet of the creature to affect it. On a successful
Will save, the creature negates the compulsion. On a failed save, the creature
spends a full-round action indulging its addiction, then may resume normal
actions while suffering one or more of the following effects (GM’s choice):

• Creature takes a –2 penalty to Dexterity and Wisdom.

• Creature takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls and skill checks.

• Creature loses 10% of its current hit points.

• Blindness: The creature has a 50% miss chance in combat, loses any Dexterity
bonus to Defense, moves at half speed, takes a –4 penalty on Strength and
Dex­terity-based skills, and cannot make [Spot](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot)
checks. Foes gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls to hit the creature.

• Deafness: The creature takes a –4 penalty to initiative checks and has a 20%
chance of spell failure when casting spells with verbal components. The
creature cannot make [Listen](modern-d20-srd-skills-listen) checks.

• Creature loses one of its extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like special
qualities.

Each effect lasts 1d4 hours. Even creatures immune to mind-affecting effects
are susceptible to a source-induced addiction.

Attraction: The creature is compelled to move as fast as it can toward the
source. On a successful Will save, the creature resists the compulsion. On a
failed save, the creature moves toward the source at its maximum speed, taking
the safest and most direct route. Once it reaches the source, the compelled
creature seeks to possess it. If the source isn’t something the creature can
easily possess, it gets a new save every round to break the compulsion.

Even creatures immune to mind-affecting effects are susceptible to a source-
induced attraction.

Aversion: The creature finds the source repellant. On a failed save, the
creature cannot approach or remain within 1d4 x10 feet of it. In the case of
traveling sounds, the creature moves away from the source as fast as it can,
stopping only when it can no longer hear it. On a successful Will save, the
creature overcomes its aversion and may approach the source freely.

A repelled creature that cannot move the requisite distance from the source
suffers one or more of the following effects (GM’s choice):

• Creature takes a –2 morale penalty to Strength and Dexterity.

• Creature takes a –2 morale penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, and skill
checks.

• Creature takes a –2 penalty to Defense.

• Blindness: See Addiction, above.

• Deafness: See Addiction, above.

• Creature loses one of its extraordinary, supernatural or spell-like special
qualities.

Each effect lasts until the creature leaves the affected area and for 1d4
rounds afterward. Even creatures immune to mind-affecting effects are
susceptible to a source-induced aversion.

Fascination: The creature finds the source fascinating and ceases all attacks
and movement upon seeing, hearing, smelling, or otherwise perceiving it. On a
successful Will save, the creature negates the fascination and can act
normally. On a failed Will save, the creature can take no actions, and foes
gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls against the creature. Any time the creature is
attacked or takes damage, it gets a new save to negate the fascination.
Otherwise, the fascination lasts as long as the creature can see, hear, smell,
or otherwise perceive the source.

Even creatures immune to mind-affecting effects are susceptible to a source-
induced fascination.

Fear: The creature is frightened by the source. If it fails its Will save, the
creature flees from the source as fast as it can. If unable to flee, the
creature takes a –2 morale penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and
saving throws. On a successful save, the creature overcomes the fear and can
approach the source or otherwise act without penalty.

Even creatures immune to mind-affecting effects are susceptible to a source-
induced fear.

Harm: Contact with the source or proximity to the source harms the creature in
some fashion. On a successful Fortitude save, the creature negates the effect
or, in the case of instant death or disintegration, takes damage instead. GMs
may choose one of the following effects or invent their own:

• Blindness and deafness: See Addiction, above. The blindness and deafness
last 1d4 hours.

• Creature loses all of its supernatural and spell-like special qualities.

• Creature is turned to stone instantly.

• Creature loses 50% of its current hit points.

• Creature drops dead. On a successful save, the creature takes 3d6+15 points
of damage instead.

• Creature is disintegrated. On a successful save, the creature takes 5d6
points of damage instead.

Even creatures immune to effects that require Fortitude saves are susceptible
to source-induced harm.
