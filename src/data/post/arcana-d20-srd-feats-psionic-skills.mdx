##  Psionic Skills

You have access to psionic skills. Check with your GM to make sure he or she
allows psionics in the campaign. You must have the GMâ€™s permission to choose
this feat.

**Benefit:** The character gains the following class skills, as described
under the Telepath advanced class: Autohypnosis, Concentration, and Psicraft.
This feat does not in and of itself grant psionic ability.

Normal: Psionic skills are special skills available to the Telepath and Battle
Mind advanced classes. Other classes may not buy ranks in these skills without
this feat.
