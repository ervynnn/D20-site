## Power Crit

You may threaten a critical hit if you succeed in hitting an opponent.

**Prerequisite:** Base attack bonus +10, proficiency with weapon.

**Benefit:** You may spend an action point before making an attack with a
weapon with which you are proficient. If the attack hits, it automatically
threatens a critical hit (regardless of whether the attack roll falls within
the weaponâ€™s actual threat range). You must roll to confirm the critical hit,
as normal. This is a supernatural ability.

Normal: You must roll in the threat range of a weapon, then confirm that
threat to score a critical hit.
