     Saving Throws Against FX Items




     Magic and psionic items either duplicate
     [spells](modern-d20-srd-fx-index)
     or
     [psionic  powers](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index)
, or they have
[spell-like effects](modern-d20-srd-fx-index)
. The
[saving throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
against an effect from a magic item has a DC equal to 10 + (1.5 x the level of the spell, power, or effect).

     Most item descriptions give saving throw DCs for various effects, particularly when an effect has no exact spell equivalent.
