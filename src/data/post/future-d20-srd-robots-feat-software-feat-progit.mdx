## Feat Progit (PL 6)


Sophisticated emulation software encased in a thin but durable plastic casing, a feat progit is installed in the robot's central processing unit and enables the robot to gain a single feat.


A robot can have a number of feat progits equal to 1 + one-third its Hit Dice (rounded down).


A feat progit can be erased and reprogrammed with 12 hours of work and a successful Computer Use check (DC 30).


Purchase DC: 20.
