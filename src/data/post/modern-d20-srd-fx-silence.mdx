##  Silence

Illusion

[ Level ](modern-d20-srd-fx-level) : [ Acolyte ](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-acolyte) 2; [ Components ](modern-d20-srd-fx-components) : V, S; [Casting Time ](modern-d20-srd-fx-casting-time) ; [ Attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) [ Range ](modern-d20-srd-fx-range) :
Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level); [ Area ](modern-d20-srd-fx-area) :
15-ft.-radius emanation centered on a creature, object, or point in space; [Duration ](modern-d20-srd-fx-duration) : 1 minute/level; [ Saving Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) : Will negates or none (object); [Spell Resistance ](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance) : Yes or
no (object)

Upon the casting of this spell, complete silence prevails in the affected
area. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible, spells with verbal
components cannot be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues from, enters, or
passes through the area. The spell can be cast on a point in space, but the
effect is stationary unless cast on a mobile object. The spell can be centered
on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it
moves. An unwilling creature can attempt a [ Will save ](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) to negate the spell and can use [ spell resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance) , if any. Items in a
creature’s possession or magic items that emit sound receive [ saves](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) and [ spell resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance) , but unattended objects
and points in space do not. This spell provides a defense against sonic or
language-based attacks.
