## Vehicle Combat Actions




    Actions during
    [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
    combat are handled the same way as
    [actions](modern-d20-srd-combat-actions-in-combat)
    during personal
    [combat](modern-d20-srd-combat-combat-cycle)
    . In general, a character can take two
    [move  actions](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions)
, one
[move action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions)
and one
[attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions)
, or one
[full-round action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions)
in a round.
[Free actions](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types)
can be performed normally, in conjunction with another
[action](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types)
.

[Free Actions](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types)
: Communicating orders is a
[free action](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types)
. Characters can perform as many
[free actions](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types)
as the GM permits in a single round.

[Move Actions](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions)
: Changing position within a
[vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
is usually a
[move action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions)
, especially if the character has to trade places with another character. If the character’s
[movement](modern-d20-srd-combat-movement-and-position)
is short and unobstructed, the character can do it as the equivalent of a 5-foot step. Otherwise, it requires a
[move action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions)
.

[Attack Actions](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions)
: Anyone aboard a
[vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
can make an
[attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll)
with a
[personal weapon](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-weapons)
, and drivers and gunners can make
[attacks](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll)
with any
[vehicle-mounted weapons](modern-d20-srd-equipment-military-vehicles)
controlled from their positions.

[Full-Round Actions:](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions)
Since the driver must use a
[move action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions)
to control the vehicle, he or she can’t take a
[full-round action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions)
unless he or she starts it in one round and completes it on his
or her next turn.
