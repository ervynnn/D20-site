## Mecha Operation


You know how to operate a mecha.


Benefit: You do not suffer the restrictions on movement and penalties on skill checks for being unfamiliar with mecha controls. You can move normally in a mecha and generally perform any action as if you weren't inside a mecha, subject to the obvious limitations of size. You threaten areas within your reach even if unarmed.


Normal: Characters without this feat take a '4 penalty on Balance, Climb, Drive, Escape Artist, Hide, Move Silently, Pilot, and Tumble checks when operating a mecha. Furthermore, they cannot run or charge.
