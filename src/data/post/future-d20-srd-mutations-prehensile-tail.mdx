## Prehensile Tail [MAJOR]


You grow a tail that can grasp and hold objects.


MP Cost: 4.


Benefits: A prehensile tail grants a +2 mutation bonus on Balance checks. It can also grasp and manipulate a simple object up to one size category smaller than the creature's size category. A prehensile tail cannot be used to operate a piece of equipment that requires opposable digits or fine motor control (such as a cell phone).


A creature can hang from its prehensile tail indefinitely by wrapping it around a larger object, thereby freeing up its other limbs. The prehensile tail isn't dexterous or strong enough to fire ranged weapons or make melee attacks, however.


Special: A creature that already has a tail cannot gain this mutation.
