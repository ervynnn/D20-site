## Microcomputer (PL 7)


The recipient has a miniature computer attached to his nervous system, usually at the base of the skull.


Benefit: The recipient may attempt Computer Use checks as a move action, rather than a full-round action. The microcomputer reduces by half the time required to operate remotes. A data port in the back of the unit allows for the insertion of a standard interface cable (purchase DC 5), allowing the recipient to transfer data without the benefit of a modem.


Type: Internal.


Hardness/Hit Points: /4.


Base Purchase DC: 35 (36 with integrated cellular modem).


Restriction: Restricted (+2).
