## Improved Grab (Ex)


If the creature hits with a [melee
    weapon](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-weapons) it deals normal damage and attempts to start a [grapple](modern-d20-srd-combat-grapple) as a [free
    action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions), doing so without provoking [attacks
    of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity). No initial touch attack is required. Unless otherwise stated, improved grab works only against opponents at least one size category smaller than the creature. A Small or smaller creature using improved grab does not apply its [grapple
    modifier](modern-d20-srd-combat-grapple) to its [grapple
    check](modern-d20-srd-combat-grapple).


The creature has the option to conduct the [grapple](modern-d20-srd-combat-grapple) normally, or simply use the part of its body it used in the improved grab to hold the opponent. If it chooses to do the latter, it takes a 20 penalty on [grapple](modern-d20-srd-combat-grapple) checks but is not considered [grappled](modern-d20-srd-combat-grapple) itself; the creature does not lose its [Dexterity
  bonus](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) to [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense), still threatens an area, and can use its remaining [attacks](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) against other opponents.


A successful hold does not deal additional [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) unless
  the creature also has the [constrict](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-constrict) ability. If the creature does not [constrict](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-constrict),
  each successful [grapple check](modern-d20-srd-combat-grapple) it makes during successive rounds automatically
  deals the [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) given for the attack that established the hold.


When a creature gets a hold after an improved grab [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions), it pulls the opponent into its space. This act does not provoke [attacks
  of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity). The creature is not considered [grappled](modern-d20-srd-combat-grapple) while it holds the opponent, so it still threatens adjacent squares and retains its [Dexterity
  bonus](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores). It can even move, provided it can drag the opponents weight.
