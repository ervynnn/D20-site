## Lifestyle


Lifestyle items include travel expenses, entertainment and meals beyond the ordinary, and housing, for those characters interested in buying a home rather than renting. Lifestyle items are shown on the table below.


### Housing



| Housing | Purchase DC |
| :--------- | -------------: |
| Small condo | 28 |
| Large condo | 30 |
| Small house | 30 |
| Medium house | 32 |
| Large house | 34 |
| Mansion | 36 |



| Lodging | Purchase DC |
| :--------- | -------------: |
| Budget motel | 7 |
| Average hotel | 9 |
| Upscale hotel | 11 |




A number of types of homes are mentioned in Lifestyle. The purchase DC covers
  the down payment, not the total cost of the home. (A character buying a home
  does
  not
  have to worry about mortgage payments; they simply replace the heros rent,
  which is already accounted for in the [Wealth](modern-d20-srd-wealth-index) system) The small house and condo
  are one- or two-bedroom homes, probably with curbside parking. The large condo
  and medium house are three-bedroom homes with garage or carport parking for
  one or two cars. The large house is a four-bedroom home with a two-car garage,
  while the mansion is a five- or six-bedroom home with an extra den, spacious
  rooms throughout, and a three-car garage. All of these homes are of typical
  construction; luxury appointments or avant garde design is available with a
  +2 increase to the purchase DC.


Location dramatically affects a homes value. The given purchase DC assumes a typical suburban location. An undesirable location, such as a bad neighborhood or a remote rural site, reduces the purchase DC by 2. A particularly good location in an upscale neighborhood or city center increases the purchase DC by 2.


### Entertainment


Purchase DCs are given for several entertainment options. They represent the purchase of a single ticket. A pair of tickets can be purchased together; doing so increases the purchase DC by 2.


| Entertainment | Purchase DC |
| :--------------- | -------------: |
| Movie ticket | 3 |
| Theater ticket | 7 |
| Sporting event ticket | 7 |



### Meals


Several typical meal costs are provided. The cost of picking up the tab for additional diners adds +2 per person to the purchase DC.


| Meals | Purchase DC |
| :------- | -------------: |
| Fast food | 2 |
| Family restaurant | 4 |
| Upscale restaurant | 7 |
| Fancy restaurant | 9 |



### Transportation


Airfare tickets are for a single passenger round trip. One-way tickets are available, but only reduce the purchase DC by 2. Car rentals and lodging rates are per day.


| Transportation | Purchase DC |
| :---------------- | -------------: |
| Airfare |  |
| Domestic, coach | 14 |
| Domestic, first class | 17 |
| International, coach | 18 |
| International, first class | 22 |
| Car rental |  |
| Economy car | 6 |
| Mid-size or truck | 8 |
| Luxury | 10 |
