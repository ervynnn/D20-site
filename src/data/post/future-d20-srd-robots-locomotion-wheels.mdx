## Wheels (PL 5)


Wheels are somewhat more effective than treads on level ground, but the robot moves at half speed when navigating poor surface conditions. Most wheeled robots have four, six, or eight wheels. Robots with wheels cannot jump or swim.


Base Speed: 30 feet.


Purchase DC: One-half the base purchase DC of the robot's frame.
