## Mecha Crush


You can hurl your mecha's body onto opponents to deal tremendous damage.


Prerequisite: Mecha Operation.


Benefit: As an attack action, you can maneuver your mecha to jump or fall onto opponents, using the mecha's body to crush them. This attack is useful only against creatures at least two size categories smaller than your mecha. The base damage for a crush attack depends on your mecha's size category, as given below. Add 1.5 times your mecha-modified Strength bonus to this base damage to determine the total damage for the attack.


| Mecha Size | Damage |
| :------------ | --------: |
| Large | 2d6 |
| Huge | 2d8 |
| Gargantuan | 4d6 |
| Colossal | 4d8 |



A crush attack deals bludgeoning damage and affects as many creatures as can fit under your mecha's body. Each creature in the affected area must succeed on a Reflex save (DC 10 + your mecha's size modifier for grapple attacks). On a failure, the creature is pinned and automatically takes crush damage each round the pin is maintained.
