## 
    Skeletal Reinforcement [MAJOR]
   



    Your bones become more resilient, allowing you withstand greater amounts of punishment.
   



    MP Cost: 5.
   



    Benefits: Your massive damage threshold increases by +3. In addition, the damage you take from a fall is reduced by one die.
   



    Special: This mutation stacks with the Improved Damage Threshold feat. You cannot take this mutation if you have the Brittle Bones drawback.
