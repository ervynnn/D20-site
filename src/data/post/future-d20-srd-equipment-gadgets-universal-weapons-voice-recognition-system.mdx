## 
     Voice Recognition System
    



     A countermeasure commonly built into weapons is the voice recognition system gadget. It requires any user to speak a command word to unlock the weapon before it can be used. Some weapons couple the voice recognition system with the booby trap gadget to require a voice command to reset the weapon to its previous state. Any weapon with the voice recognition system gadget will not fire or activate unless the owner (or designated group) gives the command word to the weapon.
