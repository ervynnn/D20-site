### Ammunition, Phasing


Phasing bullets contain microscopic computers and teleporters. When a phasing bullet encounters an obstacle between it and its target, it simply teleports past the obstacle and continues on course. In game terms, phasing bullets negate the benefits of cover.


### Beam Sword


The beam sword is the Energy Age’s most potent melee weapon. A small metal handle generates a solid beam of plasma contained by a gravity-induced force field.


### Cryonic Rifle


The perfection of cryogenic technology finally reaches its most portable form in the Energy Age. A cryonic rifle draws power from a canister of compressed mutagen, which is transmitted, via an energy beam into the target. The cryonic beam deals 3d6 points of cold damage. A target reduced to negative hit points by the weapon instantly stabilizes. Furthermore, if the ray deals sufficient damage to reduce the target to –10 or fewer hit points, the target instead drops to –9 hit points and stabilizes automatically (in other words, the target does not die).


Cryonic rifles do not use ammunition, but are instead powered by special power packs that allow 10 shots each (purchase DC8).


### Disintegrator


Resembling a laser rifle, a disintegrator fires a micro-singularity that obliterates the target’s molecular structure on impact. Any living creature reduced to –10 hit points by the weapon completely disintegrates. Objects and nonliving creatures (including robots) reduced to 0 hit points by the weapon are likewise disintegrated.


Disintegrators do not use ammunition, but are instead powered by special power packs that allow 10 shots each (purchase DC 8).


### Grenade, Cryonic


When a cryonic grenade explodes, it deals 8d6 points of cold damage to all creatures in a 10-foot burst radius. A successful Reflex save (DC 15) halves the damage. The freezing cold automatically stabilizes any creature reduced to negative hit points by the blast. If the cryonic blast deals sufficient damage to reduce a target to –10 or fewer hit points, the target instead drops to –9 hit points and stabilizes automatically (in other words, the target does not die).


### Grenade, Psionic


A psionic grenade releases a 10-foot-radius psionic blast that affects only creatures with psionic abilities or powers. Any such creature that fail a Reflex save (DC 18) cannot use its psionic abilities or psionic powers for 1d4 rounds. In addition, it must succeed on a Will s ave (DC 15) o r suffer 1d6 points of temporary I ntelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma damage.


### Grenade, Singularity


A singularity grenade generates a gravity field so powerful that it bends space into a miniature black hole. The black hole instantly devours all light and matter before collapsing and vanishing. Any character or object in the grenade’s 5-foot burst radius takes 15d6 points of damage. A successful Reflex save (DC 15) halves the damage. If the damage is enough to reduce a creature to –10 hit points, the grenade leaves no trace of the creature behind.


### Lightning Gun


A bulky and unwieldy weapon, the lightning gun is usually mounted on a tripod. It fires a crackling ray of electricity capable of sweeping large areas quickly. Characters wielding a lightning gun automatically gain the benefits of the Strafe feat.


Lightning guns do not use ammunition, but are instead powered by special power packs that allow 30 shots each (purchase DC 8).


### Pulse Rifle


The pulse rifle is a fully automatic laser assault rifle capable of firing a rapid barrage of laser rounds. The pulse rifle is the standard issue weapon given to most heavy assault soldiers in the Energy Age. Pulse rifles do not use ammunition, but are instead powered by power packs.


### Sonic Beam


The sonic blaster fires a pulse of destructive sound at the target, dealing 2d6 points of sonic damage. In addition, any creature damaged by the sonic pulse must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 15) or be deafened and shaken for 1d4 rounds.


Sonic beams do not use ammunition, but are instead powered by power packs.
