## Knockout Punch

Prerequisites: [Brawl](modern-d20-srd-feats-brawl), base attack bonus +3.

Benefit: When making the characterâ€™s first unarmed [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) against a flat-footed opponent, treat a successful
[attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) as a [critical hit](modern-d20-srd-combat-critical-hits). This damage is nonlethal
[damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage).

Special: Even if the character has the ability to treat unarmed
[damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) as lethal [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage), the [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) from a knockout
punch is always nonlethal.
