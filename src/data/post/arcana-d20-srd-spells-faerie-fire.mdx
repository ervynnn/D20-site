##  Faerie Fire

Evocation [Light]

Level: Divine 1; Components: V, S, DF; Casting Time: Attack action; Range:
Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level); Area: Creatures and objects within a
5-ft.-radius burst; Duration: 1 minute/level (D); Saving Throw: None; Spell
Resistance: Yes

A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects. Outlined subjects shed light
as candles. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally
caused by darkness (but not magical darkness), blur, displacement,
invisibility, or similar effects.

The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or darkdwelling
creatures. The faerie fire can be blue, green, or violet, according to your
word at the time of casting. The faerie fire does not cause any harm to the
objects or creatures thus outlined.
