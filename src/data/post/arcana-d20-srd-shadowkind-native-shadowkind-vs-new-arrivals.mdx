     Native Shadowkind vs. New Arrivals




     Characters can be nonhuman natives of our worldthe children of one or more Shadowkind parents, born and raised somewhere on Earthor they can be new arrivals to our world, having recently come through Shadow. In the latter case, Shadowkind characters suffer the disadvantages of being strangers in a strange land. They are restricted to a handful of starting occupations at 1st level, they have no wealth to speak of, and they speak bizarre languages unknown to the majority of Earths population (though they also acquire the common language of the land they arrive in as a function of passing through Shadow).
