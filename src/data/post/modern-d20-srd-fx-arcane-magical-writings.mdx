## Arcane Magical Writings

To decipher an arcane magical writing, a character must make a successful [Spellcraft](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-mage) check (DC 20 + the spell’s level). If the check fails, the character cannot attempt to read that particular spell until the next day. A [read magic](modern-d20-srd-fx-read-magic) spell automatically deciphers a magical writing without a [skill check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). If the person who created the magical writing is on hand to help the reader, success is also automatic.

Once a character deciphers a particular magical writing, he or she does not need to decipher it again. Deciphering a magical writing allows the reader to identify the spell and gives some idea of its effects (as explained in the spell description). If the magical writing was a [scroll](modern-d20-srd-fx-items-scrolls) and the reader can cast [arcane spells](modern-d20-srd-fx-arcane-spells), he or she can attempt to use the scroll.
