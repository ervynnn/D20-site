## Mecha Weapons


Mecha use both melee and ranged weapons to dispatch foes. In addition, a weapon can either be handheld or integrated into the mecha’s superstructure; each version has its benefits.


Handheld Weapons: A handheld weapon does not cost an equipment slot. However, a mecha with a handheld weapon can be disarmed.


Integrated Weapons: An integrated weapon takes up one or more of the mecha’s equipment slots, but the mecha cannot be disarmed of the weapon. Table: Mecha Weapons summarizes each weapon’s statistics.


To build a handheld or integrated weapon from scratch, a character must succeed at a Craft (mechanical) check (DC 30) after investing 60 hours in its assembly. A character without a mechanical tool kit takes a –4 penalty on the skill check. The character must also make a Wealth check against the weapon’s purchase DC.
