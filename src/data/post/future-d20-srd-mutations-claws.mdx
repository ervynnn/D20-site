    Claws [MINOR]




    Your hands mutate into sharp claws.




    MP Cost: 1.




    Benefit: You gain a single claw attack that deals slashing damage dependent on your size: Small 1d4, Medium-size 1d6, Large 1d8. If you get multiple attacks in a round, you can strike with multiple claws. Your claws are treated as natural weapons and do not provoke attacks of opportunity.




    Having claws does not adversely affect your manual dexterity.
