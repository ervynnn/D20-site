### Class Features

The following features pertain to the Soldier advanced class.

### Weapon Focus

At 1st level, a Soldier gains the Weapon Focus class feature, providing the
benefit of the feat with the same name. The Soldier chooses a specific weapon.
The soldier can choose unarmed strike or grapple as the weapon. The soldier
must be proficient with the chosen weapon.

The soldier adds +1 to all attack rolls made using the selected weapon.

### Weapon Specialization

At 2nd level, a Soldier gains weapon specialization with a specific melee or
ranged weapon that he or she also has applied the Weapon Focus feat or class
feature to. The soldier gets a +2 bonus on damage rolls with the chosen
weapon.

### Bonus Feats

At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Soldier gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must
be selected from the following list, and the Soldier must meet all the
prerequisites of the feat to select it.

Advanced Firearms Proficiency, Archaic Weapons Proficiency, Armor Proficiency
(light), Armor Proficiency (medium), Armor Proficiency (heavy), Brawl, Burst
Fire, Cleave, Combat Reflexes, Exotic Firearms Proficiency, Exotic Melee
Weapon Proficiency, Far Shot, Great Cleave, Im­proved Brawl, Improved Knockout
Punch, Knockout Punch, Power Attack.

### Tactical Aid

As a full-round action, the Soldier provides tactical aid to all of his allies
(including himself) within sight and voice range of his position. This use of
tactical aid requires an action point.

This aid provides a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls. The bonus lasts for a
number of rounds equal to one-half of the Soldier’s level in the advanced
class, rounded down.

### Improved Critical

For the weapon the Soldier has applied weapon specialization to the Soldier’s
threat range increases by one.

### Improved Reaction

At 7th level, a Soldier gains a +2 competence bonus on initiative checks.

### Greater Weapon Specialization

At 8th level, a Soldier gains greater weapon specialization with the weapon he
or she selected at 2nd level. This ability increases the bonus on damage rolls
to +4 when using the selected weapon.

### Critical Strike

At 10th level, a Soldier gains the ability to automatically confirm a threat
as a critical hit when attacking with the weapon he or she has applied weapon
specialization to, eliminating the need to make a roll to confirm the critical
hit.
