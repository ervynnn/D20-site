## 
     Spring-Loaded
    



     Some weapons are designed to be concealed from sight and then quickly drawn into the hand at a moment's notice. The spring-loaded gadget ensures that small weapons can remain hidden under layers of clothes or armor and still be called to action at any time. The bearer of a weapon with this gadget automatically gains the benefits of the Quick Draw feat with this weapon only, even if the weapon is hidden from sight on that character's person.
