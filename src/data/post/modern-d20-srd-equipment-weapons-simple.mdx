    Generally inexpensive and light in weight, simple weapons get the job done nevertheless.

###

    Brass Knuckles




    These pieces of molded metal fit over the outside of a characters fingers and allow him or her to deal lethal
    [damage](modern-d20-srd-equipment-weapons-explosives-splash-general)
    with an unarmed strike instead of nonlethal
    [damage](modern-d20-srd-equipment-weapons-explosives-splash-general)
    . A strike with brass knuckles is otherwise considered an unarmed attack.




    When used by a character with the
    [Brawl](modern-d20-srd-feats-brawl)
    feat, brass knuckles increase the base
    [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
    dealt by an unarmed strike by +1 and turn the
    [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
    into lethal
    [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
    .




    The cost and weight given are for a single item.

###

    Cleaver




    Heavy kitchen knives can be snatched up for use as weapons in homes and restaurants. These weapons are essentially similar to the twin butterfly swords used in some kung fu styles.

###

    Club




    Almost anything can be used as a club. This entry represents the wooden nightsticks sometimes carried by police forces.

###

    Knife




    This category of weapon includes hunting knives, butterfly or balisong knives, switchblades, and bayonets (when not attached to rifles). A character can select the
    [Weapon  Finesse](modern-d20-srd-feats-weapon-finesse)
[feat](modern-d20-srd-feats-index)
to apply his or her
[Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)
modifier instead of
[Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)
modifier to
[attack rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll)
with a knife.

###

    Metal Baton




    This weapon can be collapsed to reduce its size and increase its concealability. A collapsed baton is Small and cant be used as a weapon. Extending or collapsing the baton is a
    [free  action](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types)
.

###

    Pistol Whip




    Using a pistol as a melee weapon can deal greater
    [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
    than attacking unarmed. No weight or purchase DC is given for this weapon, since both vary depending on the pistol used.

###

    Rifle Butt




    The butt of a rifle can be used as an impromptu club.

###

    Sap




    This weapon, essentially a smaller version of a club, deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage.

###

    Stun Gun




    Although the name suggests a ranged weapon, a stun gun requires physical contact

to affect its target. (The taser is a ranged weapon with a similar effect.)
On a successful hit, the stun gun deals 1d3 points of electricity
[damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
, (do
not add the characters
[Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)
bonus) and the target must make a Fortitude
[saving throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
(DC 15) or be paralyzed for 1d6 rounds.

###

    Tonfa




    This is the melee weapon carried by most police forces, used to subdue and restrain criminals. A character can deal nonlethal damage with a tonfa without taking the usual 4 penalty.
