     Create Undead




     Necromancy [Evil]




     Skill Check: Knowledge (arcane lore) DC 31, 7 successes; Failure: Two consecutive failed skill checks; Components: V, S, M, XP; Casting Time: 7 hours (minimum); Range: Touch; Target: One corpse or skeleton; Duration: Instantaneous; Saving Throw: None; Spell Resistance: No



      Much more potent than the animate dead spell, this evil incantation allows you to create a powerful undead creature from the creatures dead remains. The incantation raises a corpse as a liquefied zombie, mummy, or vampire. It turns a skeleton into an ash wraith or spirit, and the bones turn to dust upon completion of the incantation.




      You can create an undead creature up to 20 Hit Dice, and you may control up to 20 Hit Dice of undead at a time. If you create new undead in excess of this amount, older undead slip from your control.




      This incantation must be cast at night.




      Options: The type of undead youre creating has a great influence on the Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC. Apply the following modifiers: animating spirit 10, frightful spirit 8, groaning spirit 6, Small or smaller liquefied zombie 4, Medium liquefied zombie 2, weakening spirit +0, mummy +0, Large liquefied zombie +0, possessing spirit +2, Huge liquefied zombie +2, ash wraith +4, Gargantuan liquefied zombie +8, Colossal liquefied zombie +10. If youre creating a vampire, increase the DC of the Knowledge (arcane lore) check by the vampires Hit Dice + 4.




      Material Components: A clay pot filled with grave dirt and another filled with brackish water. The spell requires a creatures corpse or complete skeletal remains. You must place a black onyx gem (purchase DC 20) into the mouth of the corpse or skeleton. The magic of the spell turns the gem into a worthless shell.




      Experience Point Cost: 100 XP.




      Failure: Betrayal and attack. The undead creature rises and attacks the caster immediately, fighting until slain.
