## Energy Age Weapon Gadgets


The following gadgets are found in the Energy Age and can apply to weapons of that era, provided all gadget-specific restrictions are observed.


### Teleporting Magazine


One disadvantage to the use of ranged weapons has always been limited ammunition. Unless the weapon's bearer is willing to cart around a bulky power backpack or ribbons of ammunition, reloading is always a problem. The teleporting magazine gadget allows a character to reload without ever having to actually reload; when the weapon detects that it has run out of ammunition, the current box magazine is teleported out of the weapon and another one is teleported in instantaneously. Though the character never has to reload, he must possess enough magazines or power packs to be teleported in or else the gadget does not function.


Restrictions: Ranged weapons only.
Purchase DC Modifier: +6.
