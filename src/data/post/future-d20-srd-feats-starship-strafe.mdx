## Starship Strafe


You can use a starship's ranged weapon set on automatic fire to affect a wider area than normal.


Prerequisite: Starship Gunnery.


Benefit: When using a starship's ranged weapon on autofire, you can affect an area four 500-foot squares long and one 500-foot square wide (that is, any four 500-foot squares in a straight line).


Normal: A starship weapon on autofire normally affects a 1,000-foot-by-1,000-foot area.
