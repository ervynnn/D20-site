## Rod

A rod is an insect with a sticklike body about 1 foot long. Short, undulating wings run the entire length of its form, allowing it to dart and maneuver quickly.

### Species Traits

Ballistic Path (Ex): A rod reacts to the presence of a psionic creature by flying toward it at extremely high speed.

As a full-round action, a rod can move up to 200 feet in a straight line, attacking with a +2 bonus (for a total melee attack bonus of +6). If it hits, the rod deals 2d8 points of ballistic damage to the target, but it is destroyed by the impact. Except as noted here, this attack is treated as a charge.

Detect Psionics (Sp): A rod is automatically aware of psionic creatures or powers within 60 feet, as though constantly under the effect of the detect psionics power.

Invisible to Naked Eye (Ex): A rod moves too fast to be seen by the naked eye, except as a blur of motion. It can be seen only as a recorded image on high-speed film or videotape, or via some similar means of recording fast-moving objects.

Vermin: A rod has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. It is immune to mind-affecting effects and gains a +5 species bonus on Fortitude saves to negate the effects of massive damage.
