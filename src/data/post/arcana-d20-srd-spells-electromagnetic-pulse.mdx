[Spells](arcana-d20-srd-spells-index) > Electromagnetic Pulse

## Electromagnetic Pulse

Evocation [Electricity]

Level: Arcane 3; Components: V, S; Casting Time: Attack action; Range: Short
(25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels); Area: 20-ft. burst; Duration: Instantaneous; Saving
Throw: Will negates (object); Spell Resistance: Yes (object)

When you cast electromagnetic pulse, you send a powerful burst of energy that
ruins electronic circuitry within the spell’s area. Any computer, telephone,
television, or other device with a computer processor inside ceases to
function immediately, and the contents of hard drives and other storage media
are scrambled.

The electromagnetic pulse affects only devices with extensive circuitry, not
everything that uses electricity. Ordinarily the lights stay on, although
their electronic switches might not function. Automobiles continue to run,
although their engines will run more roughly without electronic guidance. Most
cars manufactured after the 1980s won’t start after an electromagnetic pulse
because they have electronic ignition systems.

Devices affected by an electromagnetic pulse can be fixed according to the
following table.


<table> <tr><th>Repair Task (Example)</th><th>Relevant Skill</th><th>Purchase DC</th><th>Repair DC</th><th>Time</th></tr> <tr><td>Simple processors (cars, elevator controls)</td><td>Repair</td><td>7</td><td>15</td><td>10 min.</td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td>Complex processors (computers, home theaters)</td><td>Repair</td><td>10</td><td>20</td><td>1 hr.</td></tr> <tr><td>Data recovery (scrambled hard drive)</td><td>Computer Use</td><td>4</td><td>25</td><td>2 hr.</td></tr> </table>


You can jury-rig repairs more quickly and cheaply, but the repairs may not
last. See the description of the Repair skill for details.

Some military gear is immune to energy effects such as electromagnetic pulse
thanks to a process called tempest hardening. Tempest hardening adds +1 to the
purchase DC of an item and makes it Restricted (+2).
