## Aquan (Template)


Aquan is an acquired template that can be added to any humanoid or monstrous humanoid (referred to hereafter as the character). It uses all the character's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.


The aquan template allows the character to survive on both land and under water. A character acquires the aquan template by undergoing a course of gene therapy (see More Human than Human). The regimen requires 25 successful Fortitude saving throws (DC 20).


Special Qualities: An aquan retains all the special qualities of the character and gains the additional special qualities listed below.


Amphibious (Ex): Aquans can breathe equally well in air and water.


Blindsight (Ex): Aquans have blindsight with a range of 60 feet when under water only.


Low-Light Vision (Ex): Aquans have low-light vision with a range of 60 feet on land and in water.


Skills: Same as the character, with a +2 species bonus on Listen checks while under water, a +2 species bonus on Move Silently checks while in the water, a +2 species bonus on Navigate checks while under water, and a +4 species bonus on all Swim checks.


Feats: An aquan gains Athletic as a bonus feat.


Advancement: By character class.
