## Aquan (Template)


Aquan is an acquired template that can be added to any humanoid or monstrous humanoid (referred to hereafter as the character). It uses all the characters statistics and special abilities except as noted here.


The aquan template allows the character to survive on both land and under water. A character acquires the aquan template by undergoing a course of gene therapy (see More Human than Human). The regimen requires 25 successful Fortitude saving throws (DC 20).

Amphibious (Ex): Aquans can breathe equally well in air and water.


Blindsight (Ex): Aquans have blindsight with a range of 60 feet when under water only.


Low-Light Vision (Ex): Aquans have low-light vision with a range of 60 feet on land and in water.


Skills: Same as the character, with a +2 species bonus on Listen checks while under water, a +2 species bonus on Move Silently checks while in the water, a +2 species bonus on Navigate checks while under water, and a +4 species bonus on all Swim checks.


Feats: An aquan gains Athletic as a bonus feat.
