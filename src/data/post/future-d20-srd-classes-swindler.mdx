### Class Features


The following class features pertain to the Swindler advanced class.


Cheat Fate
Fortune favors the Swindler. Once per day, he may reroll one roll that he has just made before the success or failure of the result is announced. The Swindler must take the result of the reroll, even if it’s worse than the original roll.


Thousand Faces
A Swindler’s ability to manipulate probability makes him unpopular in certain circles, increasing the need for a ready number of disguises. At 2nd level, the Swindler becomes a master of the quick disguise. He can don a convincing disguise in one-tenth the normal time (1d4 minutes).


Bonus Feats
At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Swindler gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Swindler must meet all the prerequisites of the feat to select it.


Action Boost, Blind-Fight, Confident, Deceptive, Educated, Elusive Target, Low Profile, Nimble, Renown, Trustworthy.


Fortune’s Favor
Starting at 4th level, the Swindler learns to subtly manipulate the fortunes of his adversaries, making him harder to strike in combat. He can spend an action point to gain a +2 luck bonus to Defense against all attacks for 1 round. The Swindler must use this ability on his turn, and the bonus lasts until just before the Swindler’s next turn. A Swindler
uses this ability instead of Dodge on his turn.


The luck bonus to Defense increases to +4 at 7th level and +6 at 10th level.


Warp Probability
At 5th level, the Swindler can affect another creature’s attack roll, skill check, ability check, level check, or saving throw. As a free action during another creature’s turn, the Swindler can spend an action point to alter the target’s d20 roll result. The Swindler must be within 30 feet of the target, must be able to see the target, and must declare that he’s spending the action point before the the result of the target’s roll is revealed. The Swindler’s action-point die result counts either as a bonus or penalty to the target’s roll, at the Swindler’s discretion.


At 8th level, the range of this ability increases to 60 feet.
