     Class Features




     The following features pertain to the Glamourist advanced class.




     Self-Confidence


     The Glamourist may treat her Glamourist levels as Charismatic levels for any talent where Charismatic levels are used (charm, favor, captivate, fast-talk,

dazzle, taunt).

     Hidden Motives


     At 2nd level, the Glamourist increases her ability to hide her motives and intentions. She gains a circumstance bonus equal to her Glamourist levels when using Bluff against a Sense Motive skill. In addition, the DC for Bluff checks against her is increased by her levels of Glamourist.




     Bonus Feats


     At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Glamourist gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Glamourist must meet all of the prerequisites for the feat to select it.




     Alertness, Attentive, Builder, Confident, Creative, Deceptive, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Low Profile, Renown, Trustworthy, Windfall.




     Hidden Allegiance


     At 4th level, the Glamourist gains the supernatural ability to suppress her loyalties, even from spells and abilities. In cases where such divinations are made, the Glamourist gains a Will save (DC 15 + the character level of the individual making the attempt) to negate the attempt. Negated attempts reveal either no allegiance or a lack of the sought-for allegiance, as applicable for the ability or spell.




     Audience


     At 5th level, the Glamourist may extend any Charismatic hero talents to a number of targets equal to her total of Charismatic and Glamourist levels. Individual targets are otherwise affected as described under the Charismatic hero basic class.




     Daze


     At 7th level, the Glamourist gains the spell-like ability to daze an individual of her choice. This ability may be used once per day, and functions identically to the daze psionic power.




     Utterly Convincing


     At 8th level, the Glamourist is a master at convincing people. Whenever the Glamourist spends an action point to improve some Charisma-based skill checks (see below), she adds an additional 1d6 to the result. The skills that utterly convincing applies to are: Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, Gather Information, Intimidate, and Perform.




     Charm Person


     At 10th level, the Glamourist gains the spell-like ability to charm person once per day. This ability functions identically to the charm person psionic ability.
