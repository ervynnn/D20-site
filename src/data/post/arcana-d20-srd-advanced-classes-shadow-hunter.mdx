### 
     Class Features
    



     The following features pertain to the Shadow Hunter advanced class.
    



     Target Bonus
    

     The Shadow Hunter, as a full-round action, may designate an individual as a target. He spends one action point to select a target, and thereafter gains a competence bonus on certain actions involving that particular target. The Shadow Hunter does not need to know the target personally and may know her only through her actions or description. The Shadow Hunter may not select a target while he or the target is in combat, and once he chooses a target he must wait 24 hours before choosing another.
    



     The Shadow Hunter gains the target bonus as a competence bonus on attacks against that particular target, as well as when using the following skills directly against the target, or in tracking a target: Bluff, Computer Use, Gather Information, Investigate, Listen, Research, Search, Sense Motive, and Spot. The target bonus applies to a single individual and lasts until the Shadow Hunter chooses a new target. The bonus is +1 at 1st level, +2 at 4th, and +3 at 7th level.
    



     Swift Track
    

     At 2nd level, the Shadow Hunter may move at normal speed while using Track without taking the 5 penalty.
    



     Bonus Feats
    

     At 3rd, 6th, and 9th levels, the Shadow Hunter gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Shadow Hunter must meet all
of the prerequisites for the feat to select it.
    



     Armor Proficiency (archaic, light, medium), Brawl, Improved Brawl, Improved Feint, Improved Grapple, Improved Knockout Punch, Knockout Punch, Streetfighting.
    



     No Trace
    

     At 4th level, the Shadow Hunter knows how to hide his own tracks, and may, at his choice, move into No Trace mode. All attempts to use the Track feat against the Shadow Hunter (though not allies) treat the ground as firm for purposes of success. In addition, the DC of any attempts to use Computer Use, Gather Information, Investigate, and Research on matters involving the Shadow Hunter are increased by the Shadow Hunters levels in this advanced class.
    



     Play a Hunch
    

     At 5th level, the Shadow Hunter gains the supernatural ability to make a guess and be assured that it is correct. The Shadow Hunter may, as a full-round
action, spend an action point to determine whether an assumption, hunch, or guess is correct. The player states the assertion and pays an action point. Secretly rolls percentile dice; there is a 70% +1% per character level chance of getting a response on the hunch (failure indicates merely that you are unsure
if this is true or not).
    



     If the roll is a success, the player knows if the hunch is true, false, both or neither. A both response is possible for vague assumptions. An unknown response is for questions with no immediate answer.
    



     It may be determined that a hunch is so obvious that it does not require a roll, or that it is so vague that there is no chance for success. In these cases, the action point is not spent (though the attempt still counts as a full-round action). A hunch does not translate as a legal truth, and will not stand up in a court of law. Rather it is an obvious fact to the Shadow Hunter alone. Finding proof of an assumption would require additional work.
    



     Detect Magical Aura
    

     At 8th level, the Shadow Hunter gains the spell-like ability to detect magical aura. The Shadow Hunter may use this effect up to three times per day, and each use lasts for 20 minutes.
    



     Locate Target
    

     At 10th level, the Shadow Hunter gains the supernatural ability to know where his target is, if in the target is in the general vicinity (1,000 feet of the Shadow Hunter). This ability applies only to the target, and does not reveal attitude, status, or the presence of others around the target. This is a supernatural ability, and spells, psionics, and other FX that interfere with supernatural abilities will foil the locate target ability as well.
