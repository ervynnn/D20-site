##  Wild Talent

You have a minor parahuman psionic power. Check with your GM to make sure she
is using psionics before selecting this feat. This feat may be used even if
psionics are not part of the campaign, in which case psionics are treated as
spell-like abilities.

**Benefit:** You may use one of the following 0-level psionic powers: burst,
daze, detect psionics, distract, far hand, far punch, finger of fire, missive,
or verve. You can manifest this power up to three times per day. There is no
Power Point cost for using this power.
