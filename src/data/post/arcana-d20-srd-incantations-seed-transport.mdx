##  Seed: Transport

Conjuration (Teleporting)

Knowledge (arcane lore) DC: 32; Range: Touch; Target: You and touched objects
or other touched willing creatures weighing up to 500 lb.; Duration:
Instantaneous; Saving Throw: None and Will negates (object, subject); Spell
Resistance: No and Yes (object, subject) Incantations using the transport seed
instantly transport you to a designated destination up to 1,000 miles away.
For each additional 500 miles you wish to travel, increase the Knowledge
(arcane lore) check DC by +2.

For each additional 50 pounds in objects (beyond the base 500 pounds),
increase the Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by +2. To bring along willing
creatures, increase the Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by +2 per three
additional creatures.

You need not make a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you.
Only objects worn or carried (attended) by another unwilling creature receive
saving throws and spell resistance. For an incantation intended to transport
unwilling creatures, increase the Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by +6. You
must have at least a reliable description of the place to which you are
transporting. If you attempt to use the transport seed with insufficient or
misleading information, you disappear and simply reappear in your original
location.
