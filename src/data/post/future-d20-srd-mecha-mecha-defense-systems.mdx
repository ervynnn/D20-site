## Mecha Defense Systems


Defense systems include energy shields, life support systems, and other equipment intended to protect the mecha and its operator from harm.


To build a defense system from scratch, a character must succeed at a Craft (mechanical) check (DC 30) after investing 60 hours in its assembly. A character without a mechanical tool kit takes a '4 penalty on the skill check. The character must also make a Wealth check against the defense system's purchase DC.


### Bulwark Tactical Shield (PL 5)


The Bulwark tactical shielda high-tech version of the shields carried by knights of oldis worn on one of the mecha's arms. It improves the mecha's equipment bonus to Defense by +4.



Equipment Slots: 1, must be arm.
Activation: None.
Range: Touch.
Target: You.
Duration: Persistent.
Saving Throw: None.
Purchase DC: 5 + one-quarter the mecha's base purchase DC.
Restriction: None.


### Bastion Tactical Shield (PL 6)


The Bastion tactical shield improves upon the Bulwark tactical shield (see above). It improves the mecha's equipment bonus to Defense by +6.


When not deployed, the Bastion tactical shield can retract into the mecha's arm. Deploying or retracting the shield is a move action.



Equipment Slots: 1, must be arm.
Activation: None or move action (see text).
Range: Touch.
Target: You.
Duration: Persistent.
Saving Throw: None.
Purchase DC: 5 + one-quarter the mecha's base purchase DC.
Restriction: None.


### LX-10 Antishock Array (PL 6)


The LX-10 antishock array grounds the mecha and protects it against electrical attacks. The mecha gains electricity resistance 10.



Equipment Slots: 1.
Activation: None.
Range: Personal.
Target: You.
Duration: Persistent.
Saving Throw: None.
Purchase DC: 21.
Restriction: None.


### Barricade Tactical Shield (PL 7)


A larger version of the Bastion tactical shield, the Barricade shield not only improves the mecha's equipment bonus to Defense by +8, but its superior ceramic coating grants the mecha fire resistance 10.


When not deployed, the Barricade tactical shield can retract into the mecha's arm. Deploying or retracting the shield is a move action.



Equipment Slots: 1, must be arm.
Activation: None or move action (see text).
Range: Touch.
Target: You.
Duration: Persistent.
Saving Throw: None.
Purchase DC: 8 + one-quarter the mecha's base purchase DC.
Restriction: None.


### Delphi Defense Suite (PL 7)


The Delphi defense suite consists of a heuristic collision avoidance system, enhanced crew restraints, and a series of adrenal and nonadrenal autoinjectors for the mecha operator. The Delphi defense suite grants the operator a resistance bonus on all saving throws for 1 minute: +1 for the Mark I version and up to +5 for the Mark V version.



Equipment Slots: 1 (Mark I and Mark II versions), 2 (Mark III, Mark IV, and Mark V versions).
Activation: Attack action.
Range: Personal.
Target: You.
Duration: 1 minute.
Saving Throw: None.
Purchase DC: 21 for Mark I (+1), 23 for Mark II (+2), 25 for Mark III (+3), 27 for Mark IV (+4), 29 for Mark V (+5).
Restriction: None.


### Light Fortification (PL 7)


The mecha's structural integrity is reinforced so it can shake off attacks that would cripple it otherwise. Light fortification converts 25% of all critical hits into regular hits.


Installing light fortification requires a Craft (structural) check instead of a Craft (mechanical) check. Light fortification takes the place of one of the mecha's equipment slots.



Equipment Slots: 1 (equivalent).
Activation: None.
Range: Personal.
Target: You.
Duration: Persistent.
Saving Throw: None.
Purchase DC: 10 + one-half the mecha's base purchase DC.
Restriction: Licensed (+1).


### Lx-20 Antishock Array (PL 7)


Similar to the LX-10 antishock array, the LX-20 antishock array grants the mecha electricity resistance 20. In addition, it insulates and protects the crew from the collateral dazing effect of an electromagnetic pulse, such as the type caused by an M-70 EMP rocket launcher (page 163).


### Cloaking Screen (PL 8)


The cloaking screen warps light and energy around the mecha, rendering it invisible to visual and electronic sensors.


A cloaked mecha has total concealment. To attack a cloaked mecha, an attacker must guess in which square the mecha currently is (or determine its position based on where it attacked last), and even if the guess is accurate, there is a 50% chance that the attack misses. A cloaked mecha gains a +40 bonus on Hide checks if immobile, or a +20 bonus on Hide checks if moving. Pinpointing the location of a cloaked mecha that isn't attempting to hide requires a Spot check against DC 40 if immobile or DC 20 if moving (as if the mecha operator had rolled a 0 on the Hide check).



Equipment Slots: 1.

Activation: Attack or move action.
Range: Personal.
Target: You.
Duration: Persistent.
Saving Throw: None.
Purchase DC: 20 + one-quarter the mecha's base purchase DC.
Restriction: Military (+3).


### Deflection Field (PL 8)


The deflection field uses broadcast magnetics to provide a semipermeable energy field around the mecha. It provides a +1 to +5 deflection bonus to the mecha's Defense. The purchase DC of the system is based on the type of field (denoted Mark I through Mark V).


The operator can activate or deactivate the deflection field once per round as a free action.



Equipment Slots: 1.
Activation: None or free action (see text).
Range: Touch.
Target: You.
Duration: Persistent.
Saving Throw: None.
Purchase DC: 24 for Mark I (+1), 27 for Mark II (+2), 30 for Mark III (+3), 33 for Mark IV (+4), 36 for Mark V (+5).
Restriction: Licensed (+1).


### Medium Fortification (PL 8)


Similar to the light fortification system, the medium fortification system converts 75% of all critical hits into regular hits.


Medium fortification takes the place of two of the mecha's equipment slots.


Equipment Slots: 2 (equivalent).


### Heavy Fortification (PL 9)


Similar to the light fortification system, the heavy fortification system converts all critical hits into regular hits.


Heavy fortification takes the place of three of the mecha's equipment slots.


Equipment Slots: 3 (equivalent).
