## Morphean (Template)

Morphean is an acquired template that can be added to any humanoid or monstrous humanoid (referred to hereafter as the character). It uses all the characters statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

The morphean template allows the character to go for long periods without sleep and still function normally. It also allows the character to enter into a sleeplike trance that lasts for many days without suffering the effects of dehydration or starvation. A character acquires the morphean template by undergoing a course of gene therapy (see More Human than Human). The regimen requires 25 successful Fortitude saving throws (DC 20).

Special Qualities: A morphean retains all the special qualities of the character and gains the additional special qualities listed below.

Hibernate (Ex): A morphean can enter into a sleeplike state that lasts for an extended period. While in this state, the morphean does not suffer the effects of dehydration or starvation. Hibernation can last up to a number of days equal to twice the characters Constitution. The morphean decides how long the hibernation will last before entering into the sleeplike state. If outside forces disturb or try to awaken the character, the morphean must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 15) to end the hibernation prematurely.

Sleepless (Ex): The morphean does not suffer the detrimental effects of sleep deprivation. Once per day, the morphean can spend 10 minutes meditating and receive all the benefits of a full 8 hours of sleep. However, morpheans cannot go indefinitely without sleep. Once every 30 days, the character must get 2 full days of uninterrupted sleep or hibernation. Failure to do so makes the morphean fatigued.

Saving Throws: A morphean gains a +2 species bonus on all Will saving throws.

Advancement: By character class.
