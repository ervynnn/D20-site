##  Improved Overrun

You are skilled at knocking down opponents.

Prerequisites: Power Attack, Strength 13.

**Benefit:** When you attempt to overrun an opponent, the target may not
choose to avoid you. You also gain a +4 competence bonus on the Strength check
to knock down your opponent.

Normal: Without this feat, the target of an overrun can choose to avoid you or
to block you.
