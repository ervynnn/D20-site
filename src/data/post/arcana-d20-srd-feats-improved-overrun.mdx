     Improved Overrun




     You are skilled at knocking down opponents.




     Prerequisites: Power Attack, Strength 13.





      Benefit:

     When you attempt to overrun an opponent, the target may not choose to avoid you. You also gain a +4 competence bonus on the Strength check to knock down your opponent.




     Normal: Without this feat, the target of an overrun can choose to avoid you or to block you.
