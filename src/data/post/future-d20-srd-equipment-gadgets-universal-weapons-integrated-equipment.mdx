## 
     Integrated Equipment
    



     A particular piece of nonweapon equipment has been integrated into the weapon and can be used by the weapon's bearer at any time. This gadget is often used to give ranged weapons features like glow-lamps or flares, though it is not limited to those applications. Some weapons may use the integrated equipment gadget to incorporate a small computer or sensor module, reducing the amount of equipment the character has to carry.
    



     When selecting the integrated equipment gadget, choose a piece of equipment. That equipment is integrated into the base weapon and can be used at any time. Additionally, you must choose whether or not the equipment may be physically separated from the base weapon or not at the time of purchase. This gadget may be selected multiple times, each time adding a single additional piece of equipment to the base model.
    




      Restrictions
     
     : The character must also purchase the piece of equipment to be integrated separately from the weapon, before the gadget modification is made.
