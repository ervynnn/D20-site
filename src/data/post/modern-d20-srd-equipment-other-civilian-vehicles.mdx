A few types of vehicles dont fit neatly into the categories covered above. Many of these (such as the armored truck and the limousine) are usually custom built, so the model name isnt specified as it is with most other vehicles in this section. The description and stats reflect a typical model.

This all-terrain vehicle is something like a four-wheeled motorcycle. It is one square wide and two squares long. It provides no [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover) for its riders.



### Limousine



A limousine is a big, comfortable car. The statistics given are for a moderate-sized vehicle, rather than a stretch limo or a conventional car with a professional driver. Limousines feature virtually every available luxury feature, often including televisions and small refrigerators. A partition divides the front seat from the rest of the vehicle. A limousine is two squares wide and five squares long. It provides three-quarters [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover) for its occupants.



### Moving Truck
