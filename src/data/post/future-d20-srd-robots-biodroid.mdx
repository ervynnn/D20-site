## Biodroid (Android)


Biodroids exist in societies of Progress Level 6 or higher. They are typically modeled after their anthropomorphic creators. The technology that creates them is so versatile that virtually any living creature (except oozes and plants) can be emulated, at least in terms of movement and behavior. Under certain conditions, a biodroid can be mistaken for what it was made to resemble. However, reasonably close inspection of the biodroid reveals the presence of robotic parts in place of biological parts.


Some biodroids are built to serve their masters, while others are sold to interested buyers looking for loyal servants. As utilities, their usefulness is boundless, and most biodroids are content to perform their assigned duties without question. Biodroids make able security guards, couriers, gardeners, shuttle pilots, expendable soldiers, and even nannies.


Much to the chagrin of their creators, some biodroids are not content to serve. Perhaps due to some flaw in their construction, they choose to pursue a different path and strive to gain experiences that will lend meaning to their existence. Although some agencies have an interest in capturing and demolishing free-willed biodroids, most societies in general have greater concerns to worry about. Consequently, many freethinking biodroids are given a chance to chase their dreams  if one assumes they even have them.


### Biodroid Traits


Biodroids are constructs. They also share the following traits:


Size: Same as the emulated species, although only Small and Medium-size biodroids may be selected as player characters.


Speed: A biodroid has the same means of locomotion and speed as its emulated species (base speed 30 feet for human biodroids).


Ability Scores: A heroic biodroid has no Constitution score and a starting Charisma score of 5. Its remaining ability scores are determined normally, including the ability score modifiers of its emulated species (none for human biodroids).


Biodroids can improve their mental abilities (Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) as they increase in level (just as organic heroes do), but not their physical abilities (Strength and Dexterity).


Starting Occupation: Biodroids never get starting occupations. Starting occupations represent life experiences gained before becoming a hero, but robots have no such life experiences.


Hit Points: Regardless of class, a biodroid gains 1d10 hit points per level. At character creation, a 1st-level biodroid gets maximum hit points (10). It does not apply a Constitution modifier to its hit points but gains additional hit points at 1st level based on its size: Small 5, Medium-size 10. (For other sizes, see the Construct type description)


Armor: A biodroid hero can wear a suit of armor or have certain types of integrated armor attached to its frame (see Armor, below).


Critical Systems: Although they are constructs, biodroids have vital areas and critical systems. Consequently, they are subject to critical hits.


Cybernetic Incompatibility: A biodroid cannot be fitted with cybernetic attachments.


Immunities: Biodroids are immune to mind-influencing effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, necromancy effects, and any effect that requires a
Fortitude save unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless. They are not subject to nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain (except as noted
under Destruction/Restoration, below), energy drain, or the effects of massive damage. They cannot be raised from the dead (but again, see below).


Lifelike Appearance: Distinguishing a biodroid from members of its emulated species requires a successful Spot check (DC 10). It can use the Disguise skill to increase the Spot check DC.


Manipulators: The manipulators of a biodroid resemble the organic manipulating digits of its emulated species (a humanlike biodroid has humanlike hands, for example). These manipulators otherwise function identically to their organic counterparts.


Rejuvenation Cycle: A biodroid runs on energy cells that need to rejuvenate regularly. During a 24-hour period, it must shut down for 8 hours to replenish its energy supply. During its rejuvenation cycle, the biodroid is essentially asleep. If it fails to rejuvenate, it suffers a cumulative '1 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws each day until it fully recharges itself.


Repairable: Biodroids cannot heal damage on their own but can be repaired using the Repair skill. A successful Repair check (DC 30) heals 1d10 points of damage to a biodroid, and each check represents 1 hour of work.


Robot Resurrection: A biodroid reduced to 0 hit points is immediately destroyed and cannot be repaired, although its brain may be removed and installed in an similar but intact frame. See Robot Resurrection, below, for details.


Sensors: A biodroid hero begins play with a Class IV sensor system. For more information on robot sensor systems, see Sensors, below.


Skills: A biodroid gains and assigns skill points as other nonhuman characters do. It uses its Charisma modifier on Constitution-based skill checks (including Concentration checks).


Free Language Skills: A biodroid can read, write, and speak one language.


Feats: A biodroid receives no feats at 1st level. However, it gains feats normally as it advances in level.


Action Points: A biodroid hero gains action points just as organic heroes do.


Height and Weight: A biodroid has the same height range as its biological counterpart. Its weight, however, is equal to 1.5 × the normal weight of its
biological counterpart.


Level Adjustment: +0.
