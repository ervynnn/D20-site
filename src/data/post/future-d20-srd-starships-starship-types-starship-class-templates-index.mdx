## Starship Class Templates


A starship class template allows the creation of modified or improved versions of the various starship subtypes presented above. A template usually has an evocative name, giving rise to such ships as the Lightning-class frigate or the Katana-class assault fighter.


A starship class template is nothing more than an alternative list of design specs that allow players and GMs to increase (or decrease) a ship's Hit Dice and swap out some or all of a starship's systems. The following starship class templates are presented as examples:
