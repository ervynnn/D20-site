## Starship Class Templates

A starship class template allows the creation of modified or improved versions of the various starship subtypes presented above. A template usually has an evocative name, giving rise to such ships as the Lightning-class frigate or the Katana-class assault fighter.

A starship class template is nothing more than an alternative list of design specs that allow players and GMs to increase (or decrease) a ships Hit Dice and swap out some or all of a starships systems. The following starship class templates are presented as examples:

- [Katana Class](future-d20-srd-starships-starship-types-starship-class-templates-katana-class-template)
