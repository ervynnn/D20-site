## 
    Elasticity [MAJOR]
   



    You can bend and twist your body in unnatural ways and squeeze through very tight spaces.
   



    MP Cost: 4.
   



    Benefit: You gain a +10 mutation bonus on Escape Artist checks. Moreover, you can squeeze through an opening or passage one-tenth as wide and tall as your height, in inches. A creature using this mutation to move through a tight space moves at one-quarter normal speed.
