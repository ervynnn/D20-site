## Stunts

Stunts are maneuvers that require a [Drive](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive)
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics) to perform successfully.
Unsuccessful stunts often result in the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) ending up someplace other than where the driver intended.
When this happens, the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
[collides](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming) with
any objects in its path. Remember that the check/roll modifier from [Table: Vehicle Speeds and Modifiers](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-
vehicle-speed) affects all [Drive ](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive)[checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics) made by the driver and
[attack rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) made by all occupants of the
[vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles).

Avoid Hazard: [Vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) combat
rarely occurs on a perfectly flat, featureless plain. When a
[vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) tries to move through a
square occupied by a hazard, the driver must succeed on a
[Drive](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics) to avoid the hazard and continue moving.


<table style="float: right"> <tr> <th>Hazard</th> <th>DC</th> </tr> <tr><td> Caltrops</td><td> 15 </td></tr> <tr><td> Oil slick</td><td> 15 </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><th colspan="2"> Object </th></tr> <tr><td> Small (tire, light debris)</td><td> 5 </td></tr> <tr><td> Medium-size (crate)</td><td> 10 </td></tr> <tr><td> Large (pile of wreckage)</td><td> 15 </td></tr> <tr><td> Structure</td><td> Cannot be avoided </td></tr> </table>



Structures simply cannot be avoided. Also, if a driver cannot make a
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics) (if he or she has used all his or
her actions for the round in performing other stunts), he or she automatically
fails to avoid the hazard. In such cases, a [collision](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming) occurs.

The DC to avoid a hazard varies with the nature of the hazard.

On a failed [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics), the
[vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) hits the obstacle. For
caltrops, this means the caltrops make an [attack](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-attack-options) against the vehicle (see
[Caltrops](modern-d20-srd-equipment-professional-equipment-php#caltrops-index)). An oil slick forces the drive to make a [Drive](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics) (DC 15) to retain
control of the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) (see
[Losing Control](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-losing-control)).
Failing to avoid an object results in a [collision](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming) with the object (see [Collisions and Ramming](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming)).

Bootleg Turn: By making a bootleg turn, a driver can radically change
direction without turning in a loop. However, in so doing, the
[vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) comes to a stop.

Before a [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) can make a
bootleg turn, it must move in a straight line at least a number of squares
equal to its [turn number](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed). To make a bootleg turn, simply change the [vehicle’s](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) facing to the desired direction. The
[vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) ends its movement in
that location, at [stationary speed](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed).

The DC for a bootleg turn depends on the change in [facing](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-facing-firing-arcs).

On a failed [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics), instead of
[facing](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-facing-firing-arcs) the
desired direction, the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
only changes [facing](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-facing-firing-arcs) by 45 degrees. Make a [Drive](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive)
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics) to retain control against a DC
equal to the DC for the bootleg turn attempted (see [Losing Control](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-losing-control)).


<table style="float: right"> <tr><th colspan="2">Table: Bootleg Turn DC</th></tr> <tr> <th> Facing Change</th><th> DC </th></tr> <tr><td> 45 degrees</td><td> 5 </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> 90 degrees</td><td> 10 </td></tr> <tr><td> 135 degrees</td><td> 15 </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> 180 degrees</td><td> 20 </td></tr> </table>



Dash: With a dash stunt, a driver can increase the [vehicle’s](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) [speed](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed) by one category. (This increase is in addition to any
[speed change](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-declaring-speed)
made at the beginning of the driver’s action; if the driver increased
[speed](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed) at that
time, he or she can accelerate a total of two categories in the same round.)
The [vehicle’s](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) total
[movement](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-moving) for the round
cannot exceed the maximum number of squares for its new [speed category](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed). (The
squares it has already moved before attempting the dash count against this
total.)

The DC for a dash is 15. The driver can only succeed at one dash per round.

On a failed check, the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
does not change speed categories.

Hard Brake: With a hard brake stunt, a driver can reduce the
[vehicle’s](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
[speed](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed) by up to two
categories. (This is in addition to any [speed change](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-declaring-speed) made at the beginning of his action; if
the driver reduced [speed](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed) at that time, he or she can drop a total of three categories in the
same round.) The [vehicle’s](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
[movement](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-moving) for the round
ends as soon as it has moved the minimum number of squares for its new [speed category](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed). (If it
has already moved that far before attempting the hard brake, it ends its
movement immediately.)

The DC for a hard brake is 15. The driver can only succeed at one hard break
per round.

On a failed check, the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-moving) does not change [speed categories](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed). Make a [Drive](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive)
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics) (DC 15) to retain control (see
[Losing Control](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-losing-control)).

Hard Turn: A hard turn allows a [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) to make a turn in a short distance without losing
[speed](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed).

A hard turn functions like a 45-degree turn [simple maneuver](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-simple-maneuvers), except that the
[vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) only needs to move
forward a number of squares equal to half its [turn number](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed) (rounded down).

The DC for a hard turn is 15.

On a failed [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics), the
[vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) continues to move
forward a number of squares equal to its [turn number](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed) before turning, just as with a [simple 45-degree turn](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-simple-maneuvers).
Make a [Drive](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics) (DC 15) to retain control (see [Losing Control](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-losing-control)).

Jump: A driver can attempt to jump his or her [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) across a gap in his or her path.

To make a jump, the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
must move in a straight line a number of squares equal to its [turn number](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed). If the
[vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) doesn’t have enough
[movement](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-moving) left to clear
the gap, it must complete the jump at the start of its next turn.

The DC for a jump depends on the width of the gap, modified by the
[vehicle’s](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) [speed category](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed). On a
failed [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics), the
[vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) fails to clear the gap,
and instead falls into it (or [collides](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming) with the far side). Determine damage as for a
[collision](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming)
(see [Collisions and Ramming](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming)).


<table style="float: right"> <tr><th> Gap Width</th><th> DC </th></tr> <tr><td> 1–3 ft. (ditch)</td><td> 15 </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> 4–8 ft. (culvert)</td><td> 20 </td></tr> <tr><td> 8–15 ft. (creek, small ravine)</td><td> 25 </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> 16–25 ft. (narrow road, small pond)</td><td> 35 </td></tr> <tr><td> 26–40 ft. (wide road, small river)</td><td> 45 </td></tr> </table>

 
<table style="float: right"> <tr><th> Vehicle Speed Category</th><th> DC Modifier </th></tr> <tr><td> Alley speed</td><td> +10 </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> Street speed</td><td> +5 </td></tr> <tr><td> Highway speed</td><td> +0 </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> All-out</td><td> –5 </td></tr> </table>



A shallow gap (1 to 3 feet deep) is equivalent to a Medium-size object; the
[vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) may be able to avoid
taking [collision](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming) damage from the failed jump by treating the far side as a hazard and
then continue moving (see [Avoid Hazard](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-stunts-php#avoid-hazard-index), above).

A moderately deep gap (4 to 10 feet deep) is equivalent to a Huge object. The
[vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) can only drive out of
the gap if the walls are not too steep.

A deeper gap (11 feet or deeper) is equivalent to a Colossal object. The
[vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) can only drive out of
the gap if the walls are not too steep.

If the gap is filled with water, the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) takes only half [damage](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-damaging-vehicles) from the [collision](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming) with the ground. However, if the water
is too deep or the bottom is too soft (GM’s discretion), the
[vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) might not be able to
move.

Sideswipe: During a [vehicle’s](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
movement, a driver can attempt to sideswipe a [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) or other target, either to deal damage without
fully [ramming](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming)
it or to cause another driver to [lose control](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-losing-control) of his or her [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles).

At character scale, a [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
must be side by side with its target (that is, occupying the square or squares
directly to its side) and [moving](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-moving) in the same direction. Attempting a sideswipe costs 1 square of
movement.

At chase scale, the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
must be in the same square as its target and [moving](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-moving) in the same direction. There is no movement cost.

If the stunt is successful, the sideswiping [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) and the target both take
[damage](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-damaging-vehicles) as if
they had [collided](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming) ([see Collisions and Ramming](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming)), except that the [collision multiplier](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming) is
1/4, and the target (or driver of the target [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)) can make a [Reflex save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) (DC 15) to reduce the damage to both by half. If the target is
another [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) the driver must
succeed at a [Drive](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics) (DC 15) at the beginning of his or her next action or
lose control of the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles).

The DC for a sideswipe is 15. It’s modified by the relative size and speed of
the target.


<table> <tr><th> Target Condition</th><th> DC Modifier</th></tr> <tr><td> Each size category larger</td><td> –5 </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> Each size category smaller</td><td> +5 </td></tr> <tr><td> Each speed category of difference</td><td> –2 </td></tr> </table>



On a failed [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics), both vehicles take
[damage](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-damaging-vehicles) as
though the sideswipe attempt was a success. However, the other driver does not
need to make a [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics) to retain control.
