## 
     Stun Module
    



     One advantage of energy weapons over their ballistic and physical counterparts is that they are capable of altering their own output on the fly. With the stun module gadget, this means that an energy weapon can be used to apply nonlethal force. The stun module is an alternate firing mode; switching to or from stun mode is a free action (just like changing a weapon's rate of fire). Whenever a character fires a weapon set to stun and successfully hits the target, the target must make a Fortitude save (DC determined by cost of the gadget) or be stunned for 1d4 rounds.
