    Dataread




    Divination




    Level: Arcane 2, Divine 2; Components: V, S, F/DF; Casting Time: Attack action; Range: Touch; Effect: Read machinereadable data; Duration: 1 minute/level; Saving Throw: None; Spell Resistance: No




    You run your finger over any machine-readable data source (a barcode, a computer disk, a CD, magnetic tape, or any similar record) to understand the content of the data. You experience the data as it would normally be experienced through an appropriate machine. For example, if reading a music CD, you hear the music in your head. If reading a word processor file, you visualize and read an image of the page. If reading a barcode, you see the serial number, pricing information, or other barcoded data.




    The amount of time required to experience the data is the same as that required to read it by conventional means. You can normally read 2 pages of documents in 1 minute. This spell does not decode encrypted data. Without the encryption code, an encrypted document or file appears as a seemingly random string of characters. If you know the encryption code, however, you can read encrypted data normally with this spell.
