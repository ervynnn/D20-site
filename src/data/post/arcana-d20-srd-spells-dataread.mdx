##  Dataread

Divination

Level: Arcane 2, Divine 2; Components: V, S, F/DF; Casting Time: Attack
action; Range: Touch; Effect: Read machinereadable data; Duration: 1
minute/level; Saving Throw: None; Spell Resistance: No

You run your finger over any machine-readable data source (a barcode, a
computer disk, a CD, magnetic tape, or any similar record) to understand the
content of the data. You experience the data as it would normally be
experienced through an appropriate machine. For example, if reading a music
CD, you hear the music in your head. If reading a word processor file, you
visualize and read an image of the page. If reading a barcode, you see the
serial number, pricing information, or other barcoded data.

The amount of time required to experience the data is the same as that
required to read it by conventional means. You can normally read 2 pages of
documents in 1 minute. This spell does not decode encrypted data. Without the
encryption code, an encrypted document or file appears as a seemingly random
string of characters. If you know the encryption code, however, you can read
encrypted data normally with this spell.
