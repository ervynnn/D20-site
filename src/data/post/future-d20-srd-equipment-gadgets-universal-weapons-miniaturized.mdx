## Miniaturized
    



     By eliminating wasted space and using microscopic components, some engineers are capable of producing weapons vastly smaller than normal. Any weapon that makes use of the miniaturized gadget is two size categories smaller than normal, to a minimum size of Diminutive.
    



     A weapon to which the miniaturized gadget has been added cannot fire standard ammunition. It must fire appropriate ammunition modified by the miniaturized universal equipment gadget.
    



     This gadget can only be added to ranged weapons, as most melee weapons rely on size and mass to deliver damage.
