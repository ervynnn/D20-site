     The caster gives the subject a single command, which he or she obeys to the best of his or her ability at his or her earliest opportunity. The caster may select from the following options.




     Approach: On the subject’s turn, the subject moves toward the caster as quickly and directly as possible for 1 round. The subject may do nothing but move during his or her turn, and he or she incurs
     [attacks  of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity)
for this movement as normal.

     Drop: On the subject’s turn, he or she drops whatever he or she is holding. The subject can’t pick up any dropped item until his or her next turn.




     Fall: The subject immediately falls to the ground and remains
     [prone](modern-d20-srd-combat-favorable-unfavorable-conditions)
     for 1 round. He or she may act normally while prone, but takes any appropriate penalties.




     Flee: On the subject’s turn, he or she moves away from the caster as quickly as possible for 1 round. The subject may do nothing but move during his or her turn.




     Halt: The subject stands in place for 1 round. The subject may not take any actions, but may defend him or herself normally.




     If the subject can’t carry out the caster’s command on his or her next turn, the spell automatically fails.
