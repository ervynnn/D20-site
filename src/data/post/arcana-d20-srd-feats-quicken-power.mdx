## Quicken Power [Metapsionic]


You can manifest powers as free actions with but a moments thought.


Benefit: You can perform another action, even manifest another power, in the same round as you manifest a quickened power. You may only manifest one quickened power per round. A power whose manifesting time is more than 1 full round cannot be quickened.


A quickened power does not provoke an attack of opportunity.


The quickened power costs a number of power points equal to its standard cost +8.
