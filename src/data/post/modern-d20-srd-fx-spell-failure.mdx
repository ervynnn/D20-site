## Spell Failure




     If a caster ever tries to cast a spell in conditions where the characteristics of the spell (range, area, and so forth) cannot be made to conform, the effort fails and the spell is wasted.




     Spells also fail if the casterâ€™s concentration is broken.
     [Arcane  spells](modern-d20-srd-fx-arcane-spells)
(but not
[divine spells](modern-d20-srd-fx-divine-spells)
) might fail if the character is wearing armor while casting a spell that has a somatic component.
