## Glitterdust

Conjuration (Creation)

[Level](modern-d20-srd-fx-level): [Mage](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-mage)
2; [Components](modern-d20-srd-fx-components): V, S, M; [Casting Time](modern-d20-srd-fx-casting-time); [Attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) [Range](modern-d20-srd-fx-range): Medium (100 ft. + 10
ft./level); [Area](modern-d20-srd-fx-area): Creatures and objects within
10-ft. spread; [Duration](modern-d20-srd-fx-duration): 1 round/level; [Saving Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): Will negates (blinding only);

A cloud of particles covers everyone and everything in the area, blinding
creatures and visibly outlining invisible things for the duration of the
spell. All within the area are covered by the dust, which cannot be removed
and continues to sparkle until it fades.

In addition to the obvious effects, a blinded creature suffers a 50% miss
chance in combat (all opponents have full [concealment](modern-d20-srd-combat-concealment)), loses any [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)
bonus to [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense), grants a +2 bonus on
opponents’ [attack rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) (they are
effectively invisible), moves at half speed, and suffers a –4 penalty on
[Search](modern-d20-srd-skills-search) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) and most [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) and [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)-based
[skill checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-checks-index).
