## Hide and Seek

When being pursued, a driver can attempt a [Hide](modern-d20-srd-skills-hide)
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics) to lose the pursuer in heavy
traffic, or a [Bluff](modern-d20-srd-skills-bluff) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics) to misdirect the pursuer before turning onto an off-ramp
or a side street.

To make a [Hide](modern-d20-srd-skills-hide) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics), use the normal rules for hiding (see the [Hide skill description](modern-d20-srd-skills-hide)). The normal size modifiers apply,
but because the driver is hiding among other [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles), most of which are size Large or Huge, he or she
gains a +8 bonus on the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics). This use
of the [Hide skill](modern-d20-srd-skills-hide) can only be attempted in
fairly heavy traffic; in lighter traffic, the GM might not allow it or might
apply a penalty to the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics).

A driver can use [Bluff](modern-d20-srd-skills-bluff) to make a pursuer think
he or she is going a different direction from what the driver intends. Just
before making a turn onto an off-ramp or side street, make a
[Bluff](modern-d20-srd-skills-bluff) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics) opposed by the pursuer’s [Sense Motive](modern-d20-srd-skills-sense-motive) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics). If the driver is
successful, the pursuer takes a –5 penalty on any [Drive](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics) needed to make the
turn to follow the driver. If the other driver can make the turn using only
[simple maneuvers](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-simple-maneuvers) and does not have to make a [Drive](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive)
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics), the [Bluff](modern-d20-srd-skills-bluff) attempt has no effect.
