### Ammunition, Bio-Agent


Unfortunately for its victims, biological warfare continues to be a common part of combat even in the Fusion Age. Bio-agent ammunition is a logical extension of previous military tactics with regards to biological warfare.


Bio-agent ammunition contains a miniscule amount of a biological weapon inside an insulated chamber within each round. Use of bio-agent ammunition causes a '1 penalty to damage. However, any living creature damaged by the round is injected with a poisonous bio-agent with effects identical to cyanogen gas.


### Grenade, Concussion


Law enforcement officers in the Fusion Age use concussion grenades to knock out threatening targets. Living creatures within the concussion grenade's 10-foot burst radius take 4d6 points of nonlethal concussion damage, or half damage on a successful Reflex save (DC 15). Concussion grenades do not affect robots or other nonliving creatures.


### Grenade, EMP


An EMP grenade releases an electromagnetic pulse that instantly shorts out all electronic devices (including computers) within a 20-foot burst radius. Affected devices remain nonfunctional until repaired (see the Repair skill description for details).


The EMP grenade deals no damage to living creatures. However, a creature with cybernetic attachments takes 1d6 points of electricity damage per cybernetic attachment (maximum 5d6) and must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 15) or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. If the cybernetically enhanced creature rolls a natural 1 on its Fortitude save, each of its cybernetic attachments takes 1d6 points of electricity damage as well.


An EMP grenade deals 5d6 points of electricity damage to a mecha or robot.


### Grenade, Fireflush


A fireflush grenade contains a chemical compound that combusts immediately upon contact with oxygen


When a fireflush grenade detonates, it produces geysers of flame that fill a 10-foot burst radius. All creatures and objects within the burst radius take 3d6 points of fire damage. The blast also ignites clothing and other flammable items.


### Grenade, Tangler


The tangler grenade operates on the same principle as the tangler gun, but targets an area rather than one specific character. Any time a character is struck by a tangler grenade, that character suffers a cumulative '2 penalty to Dexterity. This penalty remains in place until the compound is dissolved.


If the character is struck with enough tangler grenades that the penalty is equal to or greater than his Dexterity, he is immobilized and may take no actions until the compound is dissolved. Dexterity penalties from tangler grenades stack with those from tangler guns.


Hardened compound dissolves naturally after 8 hours or can be removed by using solvaway chemical or some other spray solvent.


### High Frequency Sword


One of the few melee weapons to be developed in the Fusion Age, the high frequency sword is made of a durable metal alloy many times tougher than steel. Inside the blade itself, and controlled by a switch on the hilt of the weapon, are microscopic machines that cause the blade to vibrate at incredibly high speeds. Though the wielder of the weapon is shielded from these vibrations by a soft hilt, any character or object struck by the high frequency sword finds that the weapon is given extra cutting power thanks to its technological enhancements.


### Laser Weapons


Laser weapons come in many shapes and sizes, from pistols to rifles and other longarms. Many different forms of technology can be used to create laser weapons, resulting in many different forms of lasers; short, self-contained beams are as common as longer, solid stream lasers, while others produce spherical balls of energy and others fire laser rings. The coloration and noise created by the laser may vary, but the effect is the same.


Laser weapons do not use ammunition, but are instead powered by power packs.


### Mini-Grenade Launcher


Though personal grenade launchers were commonly found in the Information Age, the mini-grenade launcher is somewhat different in that it is reduced to roughly the size of a large pistol. Additionally, the ammunition it uses, while still as potent as hand-held counterparts, is reduced in size to match the weapon.


Though shoulder-carried missile launchers were commonly found in the Information Age, the mini-rocket launcher is somewhat different in that it is reduced to roughly the size of a large pistol. Additionally, the ammunition it uses is reduced in size to match the weapon.


### Stun Baton


The stun baton is a long rod similar to those carried by modern-day police officers, though on one end of the baton a metal cap that emits a pulse of stunning energy when it strikes a target. Any creature hit by a stun baton takes 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + damage dealt) or be stunned for 1d4 rounds.


### Tangler Gun


A unique nonlethal weapon eagerly adopted by law enforcement agencies around the world, the tangler gun fires condensed balls of an incredibly sticky compound that can render a target immobile in a few short moments. The tangler gun fires pellets of an inert compound that, when broken, expand into a gelatinous substance that covers large portions of a target. Unfortunately for the target, the disgusting mess soon becomes more problematic as the compound hardens. Within second, a single pellet no larger than a fingernail has expanded into a ball of goop and then hardened into an immobilizing layer of tough chitin.


Any time a character is struck by a tangler gun, that character suffers a cumulative '2 penalty to Dexterity. This penalty remains in place until the compound is dissolved.


If the character is struck with enough tangler pellets that the penalty is equal to or greater than his Dexterity, he is immobilized and may take no actions until the compound is dissolved. Dexterity penalties from tangler guns stack with those from tangler grenades.


Hardened compound dissolves naturally after 8 hours or can be removed by using solvaway chemical or some other spray solvent.
