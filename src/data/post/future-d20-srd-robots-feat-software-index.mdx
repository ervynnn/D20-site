## Feat Software


Nonheroic robots, like constructs, do not gain feats. However, at Progress Level 6 or higher, they can be programmed with software that enables them to emulate feats.


Feat software (often called featware) is usually embedded in the robot's central processor or brain and can be salvaged after the robot is destroyed (see Robot Resurrection sidebar. This is not true of feat webs, however (see below).


To write feat software from scratch, a character must possess whatever feats the software is designed to emulate. The character obtains the necessary software components by making a Wealth check against the software's purchase DC. He must then succeed at a Computer Use check (DC 30) after investing 12 hours in the software's creation.


Feat Prerequisites: Regardless of the quality of its feat software, a robot cannot emulate a feat if it does not meet the feat's prerequisites.
