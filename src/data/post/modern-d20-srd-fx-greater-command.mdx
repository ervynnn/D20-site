     The caster gives the subjects a single command, which they obey to the best of their ability at their earliest opportunity. The caster may select from the following options.
    



     Approach: On the subjects turn, the subjects move toward the caster as quickly and directly as possible for the duration. The subjects may do nothing but move during their turn, and they incur
     [
      attacks
of opportunity
     ](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity)
     for this movement as normal.
    



     Drop: On the subjects turn, they drop whatever they are holding.
    



     Fall: The subject immediately falls to the ground and remains
     [
      prone
     ](modern-d20-srd-combat-favorable-unfavorable-conditions)
     for the duration. They may act normally while
     [
      prone
     ](modern-d20-srd-combat-favorable-unfavorable-conditions)
     , but take any appropriate penalties.
    



     Flee: On the subjects turn, they move away from the caster as quickly as possible for the duration. The subjects may do nothing but move during their turn.
    



     Halt: The subjects stand in place for the duration. The subjects may not take any actions, but may defend themselves normally.
    



     If a subject cant carry out the casters command on his or her next turn, the spell automatically fails for that subject.
    



     At the start of each commanded creatures action after the first, it gets another
