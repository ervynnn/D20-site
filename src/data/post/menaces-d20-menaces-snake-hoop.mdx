## 
     Snake, Hoop
    



     A hoop snake resembles an ordinary snake except that it has a head at either end of its body. It measures some 6 feet long and weighs about 75 pounds.
    


### 
     Species Traits
    



     Constrict (Ex): A hoop snake deals bludgeoning damage with a successful grapple check against a target its own size category or smaller. The damage equals 1d6 + the snakes Strength modifier.
    



     Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the hoop snake must hit an opponent at least one size category smaller than itself with its bite attack. If it gets a hold, it automatically deals bite damage each round that the hold is maintained, and it can constrict in the same round.
    



     Poison (Ex): BiteFortitude negates; save DC 10 + 1/2 the snakes Hit Dice + its Constitution modifier.
    



     Scent (Ex): This ability allows a hoop snake to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.
    



     Skill Bonuses: A hoop snake receives a +8 species bonus on Balance checks and a +4 species bonus on Hide, Listen, and Spot checks. It applies its Dexterity modifier instead of its Strength modifier to Climb checks.
