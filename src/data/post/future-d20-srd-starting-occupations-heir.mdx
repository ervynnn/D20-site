## Heir


Heirs are the elite sons and daughters of powerful magnates, influential nobles, and imperial monarchs. Unlike dilettantes, however, they are bound by their lineage to certain responsibilities, with the assumption that they might someday rise to lead their families into the future...assuming the stars are properly aligned and they do nothing to jeopardize their birthright.


Prerequisite: Age 21+.


Skills: Choose two of the following skills as permanent class skills. If a skill you select is already a class skill, you gain a +1 competence bonus on checks using that skill.


Craft (visual art or writing) (Int), Knowledge (art, business, civics, current events, or history) (Int), Perform (act, dance, keyboards, percussion instruments, sing, stringed instruments, or wind instruments) (Cha), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis).


Pre-Selected Feat: An heir must choose the Educated feat as one of her starting feats at 1st level.


Reputation Bonus Increase: +1.


Wealth Bonus Increase: +6. An heir may permanently reduce her Reputation bonus by 1 to increase her starting wealth bonus by an additional +1d6; this expenditure must be made before the character begins play. As long as her Reputation bonus is +1 or higher, an heir's wealth bonus can never drop below 10.
