## 
     Propeller (Air) (PL 5)
    



     The robot has a propeller for air travel. It cannot travel on land without another mode of locomotion. If for some reason the robot’s speed drops below its base speed during any given round, it falls.
    



     Base Speed: Fly 40 feet (clumsy).
    



     Purchase DC: One-quarter the purchase DC of the robot’s frame.
