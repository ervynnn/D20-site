## Forgery (Int)


[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): Forgery requires materials appropriate to the document being forged, and some time. To forge a document the character needs to have seen a similar document before.  The complexity of the document, the characters degree of familiarity with it, and whether the character needs to reproduce the signature or handwriting of a specific individual, provide modifiers to the Forgery [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), as shown below.


| Document Type |  |  |
| :--------------- | :--: | --: |
|  |  |  |
| Simple (typed letter, business card) | +0 | 10 min. |
| Moderate (letterhead, business form) | 2 | 20 min. |
| Complex (stock certificate, drivers license) | 4 | 1 hr. |
| Difficult (passport) | 8 | 4 hr. |
| Extreme (military/law enforcement ID) | 16 | 24 hr. |



| Familiarity |  |
| :------------- | --: |
|  |  |
| Unfamiliar (seen once for less than a minute) | 4 |
| Fairly familiar (seen for several minutes) | +0 |
| Quite familiar (on hand, or studied at leisure) | +4 |
| Forger has produced other documents of same type | +4 |
| Document includes specific signature | 4 |




Some documents require security or authorization codes, whether authentic ones or additional forgeries. The GM makes the characters [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) secretly so the character is not sure how good his or her forgery is.



The Forgery skill is also used to detect someone elses forgery. The result of the original Forgery [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) that created the document is opposed by a Forgery [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) by the person who examines the document to [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) its authenticity. If the examiners [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) result is equal to or higher than the original Forgery [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), the document is determined to be fraudulent. The examiner gains bonuses or penalties on his or her [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) as given in the table below.


| Condition | Examiners Check Modifier |
| :----------- | ---------------------------: |
| Type of document unknown to examiner | 4 |
| Type of document somewhat known to examiner | 2 |
| Type of document well known to examiner | +0 |
| Document is put through additional tests1 | +4 |
| Examiner only casually reviews the document1 | 2 |
| 1Cumulative with any of the first three conditions on the table. Apply this modifier along with one of the other three whenever appropriate. |  |




A document that contradicts procedure, orders, or previous knowledge, or one that requires the examiner to relinquish a possession or a piece of information, can increase the examiners suspicion (and thus create favorable circumstances for the examiners opposed Forgery check).



Try Again?: No, since the forger isnt sure of the quality of the original forgery.



Special: To forge documents and detect forgeries, one must be able to [read
and write](modern-d20-srd-skills-read-write-language) the language in question. (The skill is language-dependent.)



A character can [take
10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) when making a Forgery check, but cant [take
20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index).



A character with the [Meticulous](modern-d20-srd-feats-meticulous) feat gets a +2 bonus on all Forgery [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).



A character without a [forgery
kit](modern-d20-srd-equipment-professional-equipment) takes a 4 penalty on Forgery [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).



Time: Forging a short, simple document takes about 1 minute. Longer or more complex documents take 1d4 minutes per page or longer.
