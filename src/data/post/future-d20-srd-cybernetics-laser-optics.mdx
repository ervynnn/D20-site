## Laser Optics (PL 7)


The recipient's eyes are replaced with ocular implants capable of firing thin laser beams.


Benefit: Using laser optics is an attack action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A laser eye deals 2d6 points of fire damage, threatens a critical hit on a natural 20, and has a range increment of 20 feet. Each additional eye adds +2 to the damage roll (thus, a pair of laser eyes would deal 2d6+2 points of fire damage).


A creature equipped with multiple laser eyes must fire them simultaneously at the same target.


Type: Internal.


Hardness/Hit Points: '/2 (per eye).


Base Purchase DC: Single 25, pair 28.


Restriction: Military (+3).
