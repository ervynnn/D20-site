     Resolving Collisions




     The base
     [damage](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
     dealt by a
     [vehicle  collision](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming)
depends on the
[speed](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed)
and size of the objects involved. Use the highest
[speed](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed)
and the smallest size of the two colliding objects and refer to Table: Collision Damage.

| Table: Collision Damage |     |
| :---------------------- | --: |
|                         |     |

| [Alley speed](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed) | d2 |
| [Street speed](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed) | d4 |
| [Highway speed](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed) | d8 |
| [All-out](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed) | d12 |

| Smallest Object or Creature Size | Number of Dice |
| :------------------------------- | -------------: |
| Colossal                         |             20 |
| Gargantuan                       |             16 |
| Huge                             |             12 |
| Large                            |              8 |
| Medium-size                      |              4 |
| Small                            |              2 |
| Tiny                             |              1 |
| Smaller than Tiny                |              0 |

     After finding the base
     [damage](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-damaging-vehicles)
     , determine the
     [collisions](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming)
     damage multiplier based on how the colliding
     [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
     struck the other
     [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
     or object. (For
     [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
     moving in reverse, consider the back end to be the vehicles front for determining the collision multiplier.) Consult Table: Collision Direction for a multiplier.

Once the
[damage](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-damaging-vehicles)
has been determined, apply it to both
[vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
(or objects or creatures) involved in the
[collision](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming)
. Both
[vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
reduce their
[speed](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed)
by two
[speed categories](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed)
. If the
[colliding](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming)
[vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
moved the minimum number of squares for its new
[speed category](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed)
before the
[collision](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming)
, it ends its movement immediately. If not, it pushes the other
[vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
or object aside, if possible, and continues until it has moved the minimum number of squares for its new
[speed category](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-vehicle-speed)
.

| Table: Collision Direction                                           |       |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----: |
|                                                                      |       |
| A stationary object                                                  |   x 1 |
| A moving vehicle, striking head-on or 45 degrees from head-on        |   x 2 |
| A moving vehicle, striking perpendicular                             |   x 1 |
| A moving vehicle, striking from the rear or 45 degrees from the rear | x 1/2 |
| A vehicle being sideswiped (see Sideswipe)                           | x 1/4 |

     The driver of the
     [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
     that caused the
     [collision](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-collisions-ramming)
     must

immediately make a
[Drive](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive)
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics)
(DC 15) or lose control of the vehicle (see
[Losing Control](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-losing-control)
). The driver of the other
[vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
must succeed on a
[Drive](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive)
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics)
(DC 15) at the beginning of his or her next action or
[lose control](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-losing-control)
of his or
her
[vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles)
.
