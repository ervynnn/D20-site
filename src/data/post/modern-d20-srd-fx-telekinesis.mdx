## Telekinesis

Transmutation

[Level](modern-d20-srd-fx-level): [Mage](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-mage)
5; [Components](modern-d20-srd-fx-components): V, S; [Casting Time](modern-d20-srd-fx-casting-time); [Attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) [Range](modern-d20-srd-fx-range): Long (400 ft. + 40
ft./level); Target or Targets: See text; [Duration](modern-d20-srd-fx-duration): Concentration (up to 1 round/level) or instantaneous (see text);
[Saving Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): Will negates (object)
(see text); [Spell Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance): Yes (object) (see text)

The caster can move objects or creatures by concentrating on them. Depending
on the version selected, the spell can provide either a gentle, sustained
force or a single short, violent thrust.

Sustained Force: A sustained force moves a creature or object weighing up to
25 pounds per caster level up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the
effect against itself or against an object it possesses with a successful
[Will save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) or with [spell resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance).

This version of the spell lasts up to 1 round per caster level, but it ends if
the caster ceases concentration. The weight can be moved vertically,
horizontally, or both. An object cannot be moved beyond the caster’s range.
The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If the caster ceases
concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops.

An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand, if the force
required is within the weight limitation.

Violent Thrust: Alternatively, the spell energy can be expended in a single
round. The caster can hurl one or more objects or creatures that are within
range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10
feet/level of all the objects. The caster can hurl up to a total weight of 25
pounds per caster level.

The caster must succeed at [attack rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll)
(one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using
his or her base attack bonus + [Intelligence](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier. Weapons deal their normal damage (with no
[Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) bonus). Other objects cause
[damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for
less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects).

Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but
they are allowed [Will saves](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) to negate
the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell. If
a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as
if it had fallen 10 feet.
