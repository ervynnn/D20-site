## 
     Rogue Tulpa
    



     Shamans and students of psychic powers have for centuries practiced the creation of tulpasspirit duplicates that are indistinguishable from their creators and can operate independently of them. Only the most accomplished shamans can make tulpas. However, a few deranged individuals, brimming with latent psychic power, have somehow managed to create tulpas spontaneously, with no training whatsoever. Such a rogue tulpa is a psychic construct bent on murder and fueled by rage. Although it knows the inner workings of its creators mind, a rogue tulpa exists independently, feeding on the mental energies of other beings while it acts out its creators most psychotic whims and desires.
    



     Standing as much as 10 feet tall and weighing more than 500 pounds, a rogue tulpa is a horrifying sight. Despite its warty hide, daggerlike teeth, and sickle-sharp claws, the tulpas features vaguely resemble those of its original creatorenough so that someone who survives a close encounter with the tulpa could, theoretically, identify the creator.
    



     If a rogue tulpas creator dies, the creature continues to act on its own, carrying out whatever agenda of destruction its creator had last espoused. If its creator died at the hands of another, the rogue tulpa may seek revenge on that person.
    


### 
     Species Traits
    



     Automatic Language: A rogue tulpa can read, write, and speak whatever languages its creator can.
    



     Cold Resistance 20 (Ex): A rogue tulpa ignores the first 20 points of cold damage from any single attack.
    



     Damage Reduction 10/+1: A rogue tulpa ignores the first 10 points of damage dealt by any nonmagical weapon. In campaigns without magic weapons, the GM can either disregard the rogue tulpas damage reduction or apply it only to certain types of weapons (ballistic, bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, or sonic/concussion).
    



     Dimension Door (Sp): A rogue tulpa can use dimension door five times per day (caster level 8th).
    



     Mind Feed (Ex): If a rogue tulpa hits with its bite attack, it deals 1d4 points of Intelligence damage in addition to the normal damage for the attack. If this damage reduces the opponents Intelligence score to 0, all unrestored Intelligence damage dealt to the opponent up until that point becomes Intelligence drain instead.
    



     Psionics (Sp): At willbrain lock, telekinesis. Manifester level 10th; save DC 10 + rogue tulpas key ability modifier + power level.
    



     Regeneration 5 (Ex): A rogue tulpa regenerates 5 points of damage each round but cannot regenerate fire or acid damage. If a rogue tulpa loses a limb or body part, the lost portion regrows in 3d6 minutes. The creature can reattach the severed member instantly by holding it to the stump.
    



     Scent (Ex): This ability allows a rogue tulpa to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.
