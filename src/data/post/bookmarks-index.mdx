## 
    Navigating d20resources.com with the Downloadable Bookmarks
   



    d20resources.com was made to be a simple, fast and easy to use d20 HTML resource. However, due to the large amounts of data available, making a traditional website with regular navigation is a difficult task. To solve this problem we have done two things. We have made navigation in the form of folder structure available at the top of each page and in combination with your back button the site will be easily useable.
   



    Secondly we offer another solution to help you get the most use out of this site; downloadable bookmarks. We have made these bookmarks to reflect the site structure and navigation - making it even easier and faster for you to navigate to the information you need.
   


### 
    Downloading and Installing d20resources.com Bookmarks
   



    While you can use these bookmarks in any browser, we highly recommend

### 
    Complete Walkthrough with Text Instructions
   




     Step 1
    

[
     Click here
    ](bookmarks-modern-d20-srd-zip-index)
    to download the d20resources.com Bookmarks zip file.
   



    Either save the zip file to a new folder on your hard drive or use another already existing folder. Either way, remember where you saved this file.
   



    For reference the file name is "
    
     modern.d20.srd.zip
    
    ". If you forget where you saved it, you can search your computer for that file.
   




     Tip: Personally, I prefer to have a folder called "temp_downloads" on my hard drive for just these kinds of downloads. That way it is easy to find and remove the zip file after I've extracted the content.
    





     Step 2
    


     Unzip the file
    
    using your unzipping program of choice (recommend;
    [
     WinZip
    ](http:-www-winzip-com-index)
    or
    [
     StuffIt
    ](http:-www-stuffit-com-index)
    .)
   




     Extract the files
    
    to a new folder in the same directory or a new folder on your hard drive; your choice. Just remember where you saved it.
   




     Tip: You could make a new folder in your preferred browser's directory, as you will need to save this folder for continued use.
    





     Step 3
    

    Open up your preferred browser.
   




     Firefox users
    
    : select
    
     Bookmarks
    
    , then select
    
     Manage Bookmarks
    
    . Next select
    
     Tools
    
    ,
    
     Import
    
    and navigate to the folder where you saved the extracted file to.
   




     IE users
    
    : select

     Import and Export
    
    and click
    
     Next
    
    ,
    
     Import Favorites
    
    ,
    
     Import from File or Address
    
    , and press the browse button and navigate the folders to the location where you saved the extracted file to.
   




     Step 4
    

    Now select the file named "
    
     modern.d20.srd.html
    
    " and press Okay or Next. IE users need to press Finish to complete this process.
   



    The new folder will now appear in your bookmarks or favorites list.
   




     Step 5
    

    To get the most out of your new bookmarks you will want to open up the Sidebar or Explorer bar.
   




     Firefox users
    
    : To open up the sidebar select
    
     View
    
    ,
    
     Show/Hide
    
    , and select
    
     Sidebar
    
    . Or simply press F9.
   




     IE users
    
    : To open up the Explorer bar select

    ,
    
     Explorer Bar
