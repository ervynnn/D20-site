## Healer (Template)


Healer is an acquired template that can be added to any humanoid or monstrous humanoid (referred to hereafter as the character). It uses all the character's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.


The healer template allows the character to heal wounds more rapidly. A character acquires the healer template by undergoing a course of gene therapy (see More Human than Human).


The regimen requires 25 successful Fortitude saving throws (DC 30).


Special Qualities: A healer retains all the special qualities of the character and gains the additional special qualities listed below.


Fast Healing 3 (Ex): A healer heals 3 points of damage each round. Fast healing stops working when the healer is reduced to '10 hp or fewer.


Lowered Damage Threshold (Ex): A healer's massive damage threshold is equal to Con '3.


Skills: Same as the character, with a +2 species bonus on any Treat Injury checks made to treat himself.


Advancement: By character class.
