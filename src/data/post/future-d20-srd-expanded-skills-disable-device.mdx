## 
     Disable Device (Int)
    



     You can use this skill to disable a robot or external cybernetic attachment.
    



     Check: Disabling a robot is a full-round action and requires a successful Disable Device check (DC 30). The robot must be pinned before the check can be made.
    



     Disabling an external cybernetic attachment is a full-round action and requires a successful Disable Device check (DC 30). The creature to which the cybernetic unit is attached must be pinned before the check can be made. You cannot disable internal cybernetic attachments.
    



     Special: A disabled robot or disabled external cybernetic attachment can be re-enabled with a successful Repair check (see Repair).
