## Treads (PL 5)


The robot is equipped with a pair of tank-like treads that allow it to roll along over most terrain without significant difficulties. It can negotiate reasonably shallow steps, but stairs are beyond its abilities.


Robots with treads cannot jump or swim.


Base Speed: 20 feet.


Purchase DC: One-quarter the base purchase DC of the robotâ€™s frame.
