    Salvage




    You can salvage electrical and mechanical parts from destroyed vehicles, mecha, starships, robots, and cybernetic attachments.




    Benefit: Salvaging a destroyed vehicle, mecha, starship, robot, or cybernetic attachment takes time, as noted in Table: Salvage.




    At the end of this time, make a Search check. If the check succeeds, you may increase your Wealth score by the amount indicated on the table, either by selling the salvaged parts for scrap or using them to offset the cost of future building projects.
