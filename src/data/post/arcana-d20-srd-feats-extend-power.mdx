##  Extend Power [Metapsionic]

You can manifest powers that last longer than normal.

**Benefit:** An extended power lasts twice as long as normal. Powers with a
concentration, instantaneous, or permanent duration are not extended. An
extended power costs a number of power points equal to its standard cost +2.
