## 
     Storage Compartment
    



     A simple but often overlooked modification that can be of great benefit in almost any situation is the ability to store and carry small items in a safe place. The storage compartment gadget accomplishes just that, incorporating an empty space where other objects can be carried by the wearer with relative ease. Each storage compartment gadget allows the wearer to carry two items of size Small or smaller in a container built into the armor. This gadget may be taken multiple times, each time providing another compartment where small items may be carried.
