## Skill Progit (PL 6)


Sophisticated emulation software encased in a thin but durable plastic casing, a skill progit enables a robot to gain ranks in a single skill. The number of ranks cannot exceed the programmer’s ranks in the skill being emulated. A factory-built progit typically holds 4, 8, or 12 ranks of a particular skill. A robot can have multiple skill progits. However, skill progits do not allow a robot to benefit from skill synergy.


A skill progit can be erased and reprogrammed with 12 hours of work and a successful Computer Use check (DC 20 + number of skill ranks emulated by the software).


Purchase DC: 3 × number of skill ranks.
