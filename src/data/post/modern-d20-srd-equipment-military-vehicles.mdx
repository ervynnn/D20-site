Several military vehicles are covered here. In addition, a number of the civilian vehicles covered above, such as the AM General Hummer and the Bell Model 212 helicopter, are commonly seen in military service.

### BMP-2

A Soviet-era armored personnel carrier, the BMP is used by the Russian army and more than twenty ex-Soviet states or clients. It is crewed by a driver, a gunner, and a commander. It has three top hatches, one above each crew position, and a large door in back for infantry soldiers to load or disembark. It takes a [full-round action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions) to enter the vehicle through a top hatch and another full-round action to start it moving. The BMP-2 is three squares wide and four squares long. It provides full [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover) to its occupants.

This vehicle comes equipped with a 30mm cannon (see Table: Vehicle Weapons) mounted in a full turret.

### M1A2 Abrams

This is the U.S. Armys main battle tank, probably the most advanced and powerful tank in the world. It is crewed by a driver, a gunner, a gun loader, and a commander. It has three top hatches, one for the driver and two on the turret. (The drivers position cannot be reached from the other positions, which are all in the turret.) It takes a [full-round](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions) action to enter a tank and another [full-round action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions) to start it moving. The Abrams is three squares wide and six squares long. It provides full [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover) to its occupants.

This vehicle comes equipped with a tank cannon (see Table: Vehicle Weapons) and an M2HB heavy machine gun (see Table: Ranged Weapons), both mounted in full turrets.

### M2A2 Bradley

This is the U.S. Armys principal armored personnel carrier. It is crewed by a driver, a gunner, and a commander. It has three top hatches, one above each crew position, and a large door in back for infantry soldiers to load or disembark. It takes a [full-round action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions) to enter the vehicle through a top hatch, and another [full-round action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions) to start it moving. In addition to its own armament, the Bradleys passenger compartment has ports that allow passengers to fire their personal weapons from within the vehicle. The Bradley is three squares wide and four squares long. It provides full [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover) to its occupants.

This vehicle comes equipped with a 25mm cannon (see Table: Vehicle Weapons) mounted in a full turret.

### M113A1 Gavin

Introduced in 1960s and for many years a mainstay of the U.S. Army, this tracked armored personnel carrier is now in use by more than fifty countries. It is crewed by a driver and a commander, and features a top hatch above each position as well as a rear door. It takes a [full-round action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions) to enter the vehicle through a top hatch and another [full-round action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions) to start it moving. The Gavin is three squares wide and four squares long. It provides full [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover) to its occupants.

### UH-60 Black Hawk

Introduced in the 1980s to replace the aging UH-1, the Black Hawk is the U.S. Armys primary utility helicopter. The UH-60 is three squares wide and twelve squares long. It provides three-quarters [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover) to crew and passengers (one-quarter [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover) to passengers if the cargo doors are open).
