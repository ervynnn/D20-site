## Scrying

Divination

Level: Arcane 4, Divine 5; Components: V, S, M/DF, F; Casting Time: 1 hour;
Range: See text; Effect: Magical sensor; Duration: 1 minute/level; Saving
Throw: Will negates; Spell Resistance: Yes

You can see and hear some creature, who may be at any distance. If the subject
succeeds at a Will save, the scrying attempt fails. The difficulty of the save
depends on how well you know the subject and what sort of physical connection
(if any) you have to that creature. Furthermore, if the subject is on another
plane or in some other dimension (such as the extradimensional space created
by a clown car spell), it gains a +5 circumstance bonus to its Will save.

If the save fails, you can see the subject and the subject’s immediate
surroundings (approximately 10 feet in all directions of the subject). If the
subject moves, the sensor follows at a speed of up to 150 feet.

The following spells, if active on the caster during the scrying, operate
through the sensor: darkvision, read magic, tongues, and true seeing. Detect
magical aura has a 5% chance per caster level of operating correctly through
the sensor.

Arcane Material Components: Some droplets of nitric acid in an eyedropper.

Arcane Focus: A mirror of finely wrought silver (at least 2 feet by 4 feet) or
an orb of polished crystal (at least 5 inches in diameter). Either item has a
purchase DC of 19.

Divine Focus: A font filled with holy water (purchase DC 8).
