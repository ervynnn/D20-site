## Tentacle [MAJOR]


A single tentacle grows from your side or back. The tentacle might resemble an octopuss suckered tentacle or a simple, scaly pseudopod.


MP Cost: 6.


Benefits: The tentacle grants a +4 mutation bonus on grapple checks. It can also grasp and manipulate a simple object of your size category or smaller. For example, a Medium-size creature can use the tentacle to grasp and manipulate a Medium-size or smaller object. The tentacle cannot be used to operate a piece of equipment that requires opposable digits or fine motor control (such as a cell phone).


You can hang from your tentacle indefinitely by wrapping it around a larger object, thereby freeing up your other limbs. The tentacle isnt dexterous enough to fire ranged weapons, but it can be used to make a slam attack. The tentacles slam attack deals an amount of bludgeoning damage dependent on your size: Small 1d4, Medium-size 1d6, Large 1d8. If you get multiple attacks in a round, you can strike with the tentacle multiple times. The tentacle is treated as a natural weapon with a 10-foot reach, and attacks made with it do not provoke attacks of opportunity.
