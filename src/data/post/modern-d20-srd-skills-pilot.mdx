## Pilot (Dex) Trained Only

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): Typical piloting tasks dont require checks. [Checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) are required during combat, for [special maneuvers](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-simple-maneuvers), or in other extreme circumstances, or when the pilot wants to attempt something outside the normal parameters of the vehicle. When flying, the character can attempt [simple maneuvers](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-simple-maneuvers) and [stunts](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-stunts) (actions in which the pilot attempts to do something complex very quickly or in a limited space).

Each [vehicles](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) description includes a maneuver modifier that applies to Pilot [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) made by the operator of the vehicle.

Special: A character can [take 10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) when making a Pilot [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), but cant [take 20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index).

A character with the [Vehicle Expert](modern-d20-srd-feats-vehicle-expert) feat gets a +2 bonus on all Pilot [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

There is no penalty for operating a general-purpose fixed-wing [aircraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-civilian-aircraft). Other types of aircraft (heavy aircraft, helicopters, jet fighters, and spacecraft) require the corresponding [Aircraft Operation](modern-d20-srd-feats-aircraft-operation) feat, or else the character takes a 4 penalty on Pilot [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

Time: A Pilot [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) is a [move action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions).
