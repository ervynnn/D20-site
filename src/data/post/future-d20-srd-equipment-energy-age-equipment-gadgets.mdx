## Energy Age Equipment Gadgets


The following gadget is found in the Energy Age and can apply to pieces of equipment of that era, provided all gadget-specific restrictions are observed.


### Hud Software, Biosensor


A piece of software for the heads-up display device, biosensor software allows the wearer of the HUD to identify potential weaknesses in enemies. When worn, the biosensor software integrates elements of the medicomp sensor (though the sensor itself is not required) and can identify exactly how many hit points a target has left. Initiating this scan requires a full-round action, however, as the target must be kept precisely within the sensors range for the duration of the scan.


Restrictions: Heads-up displays only.
Purchase DC Modifier: +4.
