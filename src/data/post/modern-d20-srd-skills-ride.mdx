## Ride ([Dex](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores))

Animals ill suited as mounts provide a –2 penalty on their rider’s Ride
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

Check: Typical riding actions don’t require [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). A character can saddle, mount, ride, and
dismount without a problem. Mounting or dismounting an animal is a [move action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions). Some tasks, such as those
undertaken in combat or other extreme circumstances, require
[checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). In
addition, attempting trick riding or asking the animal to perform an unusual
technique also requires a [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

Guide with Knees (DC 5): The character can react instantly to guide his or her
mount with his or her knees so that the character can use both hands in combat
or to perform some other action. Make the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) at the start of the character’s round. If the
character fails, he or she can only use one hand this round because the
character needs to use the other to control his or her mount.

Stay in Saddle (DC 5): The character can react instantly to try to avoid
falling when his or her mount rears or bolts unexpectedly or when the
character takes damage.

Fight while Mounted (DC 20): While in combat, the character can attempt to
control a mount that is not trained in combat riding (see the [Handle Animal](modern-d20-srd-skills-handle-animal) skill). If the character
succeeds, he or she uses only a [move action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions), and the character can use his or her [attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) to do something else. If the character fails, he or she
can do nothing else that round. If the character fails by more than 5, he or
she loses control of the animal.

For animals trained in combat riding, the character does not need to make this
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). Instead,
the character can use his or her [move action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions) to have the animal perform a trick (commonly, to
[attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll)). The character can use his or her
[attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) normally.

[Cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover) (DC 15): The character can react
instantly to drop down and hang alongside his or her mount, using it as one-
half [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover). The character can’t attack while
using his or her mount as [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover). If the
character fails, he or she doesn’t get the [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover) benefit.

Soft Fall (DC 15): The character reacts instantly when he or she falls off a
mount, such as when it is killed or when it falls, to try to avoid taking
damage. If the character fails, he or she takes 1d6 points of [falling damage](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-falling).

Leap (DC 15): The character can get his or her mount to leap obstacles as part
of its [movement](modern-d20-srd-combat-movement-and-position). Use the
character’s Ride modifier or the mount’s [Jump](modern-d20-srd-skills-jump)
modifier (whichever is lower) when the mount makes its [Jump](modern-d20-srd-skills-jump) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index)
(see the [Jump](modern-d20-srd-skills-jump) skill). The character makes a Ride
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 15) to
stay on the mount when it leaps.

Fast Mount or Dismount (DC 20; armor penalty applies): The character can mount
or dismount as a [free action](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types). If the
character fails the [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), mounting or dismounting is a [move action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions). (A character can’t attempt a fast mount or dismount
unless he or she can perform the mount or dismount as a [move action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions) this round, should the
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) fail.)

Special: If the character is riding bareback, he or she takes a –5 penalty on
Ride [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

A character can [take 10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index)
when making a Ride [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), but can’t [take 20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index).

A character with the [Animal Affinity](modern-d20-srd-feats-animal-affinity)
feat gets a +2 bonus on all Ride [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

Time: Ride is a [move action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions), except when
otherwise noted for the special tasks listed above.
