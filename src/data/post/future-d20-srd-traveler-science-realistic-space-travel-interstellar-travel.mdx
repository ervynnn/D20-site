## Interstellar Travel

Realistically, the starships presented in the Starships section are capable only of interplanetary travel, not interstellar travel. The reason for this is simple: Even the best engine cant accelerate a ship to light speed, and without light speed, interstellar journeys take tens of thousands of years. The speed of light is 186,000 miles per second. Thats 1,116,000 miles per round, or 66,960,000 miles per hour. Maneuvering a ship at this speed is a tricky proposition; by the time you notice an object in your path, its probably too late to avoid it. One must also consider relativity: The closer the ships velocity comes to the speed of light, the greater its mass. A starship cannot achieve light speed via simple acceleration, no matter how powerful the ships engine, as increasing the power only increases the mass.

The greatest impediment to traveling between the stars is time: What would be the point of sending astronauts to Alpha Centauri, for example, if, by the time they arrived, no one on Earth could remember why theyd gone in the first place? Time dilationthe slowing of the passage of time in relation to an object traveling at close to the speed of lightbecomes a factor. A few years might pass on board the ship, while a few hundred years might have passed both at the ships point of origin and its point of arrival.
