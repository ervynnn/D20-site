## 
     Thruster (PL 7)
    



     Thrusters use a miniature impulse engine to produce a stream of high-energy particles, contained and directed by magnetic fields. The exhaust is hot, but not dangerously so. Thrusters enable the robot to fly and hover.
    



     Base Speed: Fly 30 feet (poor).
    



     Purchase DC: One-half the base purchase DC of the robot's frame.
