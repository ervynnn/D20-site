###  Psionic Skills


<table style="float: right"> <tr> <th> Task </th> <th> DC </th> </tr> <tr> <td> Resist fear </td> <td> 15 </td> </tr> <tr class="shaded"> <td> Memorize </td> <td> 15 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> Tolerate poison </td> <td> Poison’s DC </td> </tr> <tr class="shaded"> <td> Willpower </td> <td> 20 </td> </tr> </table>


A Telepath has access to the following psionic skills. These skills are
considered class skills for the Telepath, and he can use his skill points to
buy ranks in them, just like other skills in the game.

**Autohypnosis** [ (Wis) ](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) : Trained
only. You have trained your mind to resist certain injuries and threats while
also gaining a few select benefits.

Check: The DC and effect depend on the task you attempt.

**Resist Fear** : In response to a fear effect, you can make an Autohypnosis
check on your next action even if you’ve been overcome by fear. A successful
check grants you another [ saving throw ](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
with a +4 morale bonus to resist the fear effect.

**Memorize** : You can attempt to memorize a long string of numbers, a long
passage of verse, or other particularly difficult piece of information. Each
successful check allows you to memorize up to 250 words or the equivalent of
what could be comfortably contained on an 8 1/2-by-11-inch sheet of paper. You
always retain this information; however, you can only recall it with a
successful Autohypnosis check.

**Tolerate[ Poison ](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-poison) ** : In
response to being [ poisoned ](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-poison) ,
you can make an Autohypnosis check on your next action. A successful check
grants you a +4 morale bonus on your [ saving throw ](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) to resist the [ poison’s ](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-poison) secondary damage.

**Willpower** : If reduced to 0 [ hit points ](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points) ( [ disabled ](modern-d20-srd-conditions-index) ), you may make an
Autohypnosis check. If successful, you can perform a strenuous action without
taking 1 point of [ damage ](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) . A failed check
carries no penalties—you can choose not to perform the strenuous action. If
you do perform the strenuous action after failing the check, you take 1 point
of [ damage ](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) , as normal.

Try Again?: For resist fear and memorize, you can make a check once per round.
You can’t try again to tolerate [ poison ](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-poison) . You can’t try again in the same round for willpower.

Special: You can [ take 10 ](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) on Autohypnosis checks, but you can’t [ take 20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index) .

Most uses of Autohypnosis are [ attack actions ](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) . Willpower is a [ free action ](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types)
that can be attempted once per round.

**Concentration** [ (Con) ](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) : The normal
Concentration skill expands to include psionic applications, as defined below.

Check: You must make a Concentration check whenever you may potentially be
distracted while engaged in an activity, including manifesting a power or
concentrating on an active power, that requires your full attention.

If the check succeeds, you may continue with the action as normal. If the
check fails, the action automatically fails and is wasted. If you were in the
process of manifesting a power, the power is lost. If you were concentrating
on an active power, the power ends. The table in the Concentration skill
description summarizes the various types of distractions. In situations where
the distraction occurs while you are manifesting a power, you add the level of
the power to the DC.

Try Again?: You can try again, but doing so doesn’t cancel the effects of a
previous failure. If you lost a power, the power is lost.

Special: By making a check (DC 15 + power level), you can use Concentration to
manifest a power defensively, thus avoiding attacks of opportunity. If the
check succeeds, you can attempt the action without incurring any attacks of
opportunity.

**Psicraft** [ (Int) ](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) : Trained only.
Use this skill to identify [ psionic powers ](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index)
as they manifest or [ psionic ](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index) effects already
in place.

Check: You can identify [ psionic powers ](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index) and
effects.


<table> <tr> <th> DC </th> <th> Task </th> </tr> <tr> <td> 15 + power level </td> <td> Identify a <a href="modern-d20-srd-psionics-index"> psionic power </a> as it manifests. (You must sense the power’s display or see some visible effect to identify a power.) You can’t try again. </td> </tr> <tr class="shaded"> <td> 20 + power level </td> <td> Identify a power that’s already in place and in effect. (You must be able to see or detect the effects of the power.) You can’t try again. </td> </tr> <tr> <td> 20 + power level </td> <td> Identify materials created or shaped by <a href="modern-d20-srd-psionics-index"> psionics </a> . You can’t try again. </td> </tr> <tr class="shaded"> <td> 30 or higher </td> <td> Understand a strange or unique <a href="modern-d20-srd-psionics-index"> psionic </a> effect. You can’t try again. </td> </tr> </table>


Try Again?: See above.

Time: Unless otherwise indicated, Psicraft is a [ move action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions) .

###  [ Psionic Powers ](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index)


<table style="float: right"> <tr> <th colspan="8"> —— Powers Discovered by Level —— </th> </tr> <tr> <th> Telepath Level </th> <th> Pts/Day </th> <th> 0 </th> <th> 1 </th> <th> 2 </th> <th> 3 </th> <th> 4 </th> <th> 5 </th> </tr> <tr> <td> 1st </td> <td> 2 </td> <td> 3 </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> — </td> <td> — </td> <td> — </td> <td> — </td> </tr> <tr class="shaded"> <td> 2nd </td> <td> 3 </td> <td> 3 </td> <td> 2 </td> <td> — </td> <td> — </td> <td> — </td> <td> — </td> </tr> <tr> <td> 3rd </td> <td> 4 </td> <td> 3 </td> <td> 3 </td> <td> — </td> <td> — </td> <td> — </td> <td> — </td> </tr> <tr class="shaded"> <td> 4th </td> <td> 7 </td> <td> 4 </td> <td> 3 </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> — </td> <td> — </td> <td> — </td> </tr> <tr> <td> 5th </td> <td> 10 </td> <td> 4 </td> <td> 3 </td> <td> 2 </td> <td> — </td> <td> — </td> <td> — </td> </tr> <tr class="shaded"> <td> 6th </td> <td> 15 </td> <td> 4 </td> <td> 3 </td> <td> 2 </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> — </td> <td> — </td> </tr> <tr> <td> 7th </td> <td> 20 </td> <td> 5 </td> <td> 4 </td> <td> 3 </td> <td> 2 </td> <td> — </td> <td> — </td> </tr> <tr class="shaded"> <td> 8th </td> <td> 27 </td> <td> 5 </td> <td> 4 </td> <td> 3 </td> <td> 2 </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> — </td> </tr> <tr> <td> 9th </td> <td> 34 </td> <td> 5 </td> <td> 4 </td> <td> 3 </td> <td> 3 </td> <td> 2 </td> <td> — </td> </tr> <tr class="shaded"> <td> 10th </td> <td> 43 </td> <td> 6 </td> <td> 4 </td> <td> 3 </td> <td> 3 </td> <td> 2 </td> <td> 1 </td> </tr> </table>


The Telepath’s main strength is his ability to manifest [ psionic powers](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index) .

A [ psionic power ](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index) is a one-time [ psionic](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index) effect. [ Psionic powers ](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index) require power points to use. Unlike [ arcane spellcasters](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-mage) , Telepaths don’t have spellbooks and
they don’t prepare powers ahead of time. In addition, a Telepath can use [psionics ](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index) while wearing armor without risking
the failure of the power.

A Telepath’s level limits the number of power points available for manifesting
[ powers ](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index) . In addition, a Telepath must have
a key [ ability score ](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) equal to at
least 10 + the power’s level to manifest a particular power.

The Telepath’s selection of powers is extremely limited, although he enjoys
ultimate flexibility. At 1st level, a Telepath knows three 0-level [ powers](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index) of your choice and one 1st-level [ power](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index) . At each level, the Telepath discovers one
or more previously latent [ powers ](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index) , as
indicated on the table below.

The DC for [ saving throws ](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) to resist a
[ psionic power ](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index) is 10 + the power’s level +
the Telepath’s key [ ability modifier ](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)
.


<table style="float:right"> <tr> <th> Cha Score </th> <th> Bonus Power Points per Day </th> </tr> <tr> <td> 12–13 </td> <td> 1 </td> </tr> <tr class="shaded"> <td> 14–15 </td> <td> 3 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> 16–17 </td> <td> 5 </td> </tr> <tr class="shaded"> <td> 18–19 </td> <td> 7 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> 20–21 </td> <td> 9 </td> </tr> <tr class="shaded"> <td> 22–23 </td> <td> 11 </td> </tr> </table>


A Telepath can manifest a certain number of [ powers ](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index) per day based on his available power points. (0-level powers
have a special cost; see [ Psionic Basics ](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index) .)
He just pays the power point cost of a [ power ](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index) to manifest it, no preparation necessary. The base number of power
points available per day is shown on the table above. This number is improved
by bonus points determined by the Telepath’s [ Charisma ](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) score, as shown on the table below.

###  Trigger Power

At 2nd, 5th, and 8th level, the Telepath chooses one [ psionic power](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index) that he can attempt to manifest for no power
point cost.

At each of these levels, you select one 0-, 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level power you
can use. From that point on, you can attempt to trigger that power without
paying its cost. To trigger a power, you must have enough power points to
cover the normal cost of the power manifestation. Then, make an [ ability check ](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) appropriate to the power.

If you succeed at the [ ability check ](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)
, the power manifests with no cost in power points. If the check fails, you
pay the power point cost and the power manifests.

DCs for the ability check depend on the level of the power: 0-level, DC 11;
1st-level, DC 13; 2nd-level, DC 15; and 3rd-level, DC 17.

###  Bonus Feats

At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Telepath gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat
must be selected from the following list, and the Telepath must meet all the
prerequisites of the feat to select it.

[ Alertness ](modern-d20-srd-feats-alertness) , [ Animal Affinity](modern-d20-srd-feats-animal-affinity) , [ Attentive ](modern-d20-srd-feats-attentive) , [ Blind-Fight ](modern-d20-srd-feats-blind-fight) , [ Combat Expertise ](modern-d20-srd-feats-combat-expertise) , [ Confident](modern-d20-srd-feats-confident) , [ Creative ](modern-d20-srd-feats-creative) , [ Deceptive ](modern-d20-srd-feats-deceptive) , [ Educated](modern-d20-srd-feats-educated) , [ Focused ](modern-d20-srd-feats-focused) ,
[ Frightful Presence ](modern-d20-srd-feats-frightful-presence) , [ Iron Will](modern-d20-srd-feats-iron-will) , [ Renown ](modern-d20-srd-feats-renown) ,
[ Stealthy ](modern-d20-srd-feats-stealthy) , [ Studious ](modern-d20-srd-feats-studious) .

###  Power Crystal

At 4th level, the Telepath can store excess power points in a power crystal
specially attuned to him. Encoding the crystal takes 24 hours and requires a
gem with a purchase DC of 20. When complete, the power crystal is a
psionically charged crystalline stone no more than an inch in diameter. A
Telepath can possess no more than one power crystal at a time.

A power crystal is imbued with 5 power points when it is created. The Telepath
can call upon these power points at any time and use them just as he would his
natural power points. Once the crystal is depleted, the Telepath must refill
it using up to 5 power points from his own reserves. A power crystal can be
recharged after a Telepath has rested and renewed his own reserves of power
points for the day..

###  Combat Manifestation

At 7th level, a Telepath becomes adept at manifesting [ psionic powers](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index) in combat. He gets a +4 bonus on [Concentration ](modern-d20-srd-skills-concentration) checks to manifest a [power ](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index) while on the defensive.

###  Maximize Power

At 10th level, a Telepath learns to manifest [ psionic powers](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index) to maximum effect. All variable, numeric
effects of a maximized power automatically achieve their maximum values. A
maximized power deals the most possible points of [ damage ](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) , affects the maximum number of targets, and so forth, as
appropriate. [ Saving throws ](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) and
opposed checks are not affected. Powers without random variables are not
affected.

A maximized [ power ](modern-d20-srd-psionics-index) costs a number of power
points equal to its normal cost +6.
