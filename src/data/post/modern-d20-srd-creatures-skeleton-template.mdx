## Skeleton (Template)

### Template Traits

“Skeleton” is an acquired template that can be added to any living corporeal
creature that has a skeletal structure (referred to hereafter as the base
creature). A skeleton uses all the base creature’s statistics except as noted
here.

Challenge Rating: A skeleton’s Challenge Rating depends on its size: Tiny or
smaller 1/10, Small 1/6, Medium-size 1/3, Large 2, Huge 5, Gargantuan 9,
Colossal 12.

Type: The creature’s type changes to [undead](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-undead).

Hit Dice: Drop any Hit Dice gained from attaining levels, and raise the
remaining Hit Dice to d12.

Speed: Winged skeletons can’t use their wings to fly. If the base creature
flew magically, so can the skeleton.

Defense: A skeleton’s natural armor bonus to Defense changes to a value based
on its size: Tiny or smaller +0, Small +1, Medium-size +2, Large +3, Huge +4,
Gargantuan +6, Colossal +10.

Attacks: A skeleton retains all the natural attacks, manufactured weapons, and
weapon proficiencies of the base creature, except for attacks that can’t work
without flesh. A creature with hands gains one claw attack per hand; the
skeleton can strike with all of them at its full attack bonus. (If the base
creature already had claw attacks, it can use the skeleton claw attack and
damage, if they’re better.)

Damage: Natural and manufactured weapons deal damage normally. A claw attack
deals damage depending on the skeleton’s size (use the base creature’s claw
damage if it’s greater): Diminutive or Fine 1, Tiny 1d2, Small 1d3, Medium-
size 1d4, Large 1d6, Huge 1d8, Gargantuan 2d6, Colossal 2d8.

Special Qualities: A skeleton loses all of the base creature’s special
qualities except for immunity or resistance to specific energy types. In
addition to gaining the [undead](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-undead) type, a
skeleton has the following special quality.

Skeleton Immunities (Ex): A skeleton has cold immunity. Because it lacks flesh
and internal organs, a skeleton takes only half damage from ballistic,
piercing, or slashing weapons.

Allegiances: A skeleton loses any previous allegiances and adopts a new
allegiance to its creator. This allegiance cannot be broken.

[Saves](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): A skeleton’s saving throw
modifiers are based on Hit Dice and given in [Table: Creature Saves and Base Attack Bonuses](modern-d20-srd-creatures-creature-overview).

[Action Points](modern-d20-srd-basics-action-points): A skeleton does not
acquire or amass action points. It loses any action points possessed by the
base creature.

[Reputation Bonus](modern-d20-srd-reputation-index): A skeleton has a +0
Reputation bonus.

[Ability Scores](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores): A skeleton gains the
following ability score increase: [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) +2. In addition, a skeleton has no [Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) or [Intelligence](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)
score, its [Wisdom](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) changes to 10, and
its [Charisma](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) changes to 1.

[Skills](modern-d20-srd-skills-index): A skeleton loses all skills.

[Feats](modern-d20-srd-feats-index): A skeleton loses all feats except those
that confer armor or weapon proficiency ([Archaic Weapons Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-archaic-weapons-proficiency), Armor
Proficiency, [Exotic Firearms Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-exotic-firearms-proficiency), [Exotic Melee Weapon Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-exotic-melee-weapons-proficiency), [Personal Firearms Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-personal-firearms-proficiency), and [Simple Weapons Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-simple-weapons-proficiency)). A
skeleton gains the feat [Improved Initiative](modern-d20-srd-feats-improved-initiative).
