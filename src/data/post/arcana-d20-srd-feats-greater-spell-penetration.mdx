## 
     Greater Spell Penetration
    



     Your spells are remarkably potent, breaking through spell resistance more readily than normal.
    



     Prerequisites: Spell Penetration.
    




      Benefit:
     
     You get a +4 bonus on caster level checks (1d20 + caster level) to beat a creatures spell resistance. This overlaps (does not stack) with the bonus from Spell Penetration (see below).
