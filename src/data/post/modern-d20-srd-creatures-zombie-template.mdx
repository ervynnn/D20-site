## Zombie (Template)

Zombies do not speak, but they understand the orders of their creators.

### Template Traits

Zombie is a template that can be added to any corporeal creature other than an [undead](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-undead) (referred to hereafter as the base creature. It uses all the base creatures statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

Challenge Rating: A zombies challenge rating depends on its size: Tiny or smaller 1/8, Small 1/4, Medium-size 1/2, Large 3, Huge 6, Gargantuan 10, Colossal 13.

Type: The creatures type changes to [undead](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-undead).

Hit Dice: Drop any Hit Dice gained from experience, double the number of Hit Dice left, and raise them to d12.

Speed: If the base creature could fly, its maneuverability rating as a zombie drops to clumsy.

[Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense): A zombies natural armor bonus to [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense) increases to a value based on the zombies size (but use the base creatures natural armor bonus, if its higher): Tiny or smaller +0, Small +1, Medium-size +2, Large +3, Huge +4, Gargantuan +7, Colossal +11.

Attacks: The zombie retains all the natural attacks and manufactured weapons of the base creature, but loses any weapon proficiency feats. A zombie also gains a slam attack.

Damage: Natural and manufactured weapons deal [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) normally. A slam attack deals [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) depending on the zombies size (but use the base creatures slam damage if its greater): Fine 1, Diminutive 1d2, Tiny 1d3, Small 1d4, Medium-size 1d6, Large 1d8, Huge 2d6, Gargantuan 2d8, Colossal 4d6.

For purposes of [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) bonuses to [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage), a slam attack is considered a two-handed attack.

Special Qualities: A zombie loses all of the base creatures supernatural and spell-like qualities except for immunity or resistance to specific energy types. A zombie may retain any or all of the base creatures extraordinary abilities, at the GMs discretion. In addition to gaining the [undead](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-undead) type, a zombie has the following special quality:

[Move](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions) or [Attack Action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) Only (Ex): A zombie has poor reflexes and can perform only a single [move action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions) or [attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) on its turn. It can only move and attack if it charges.

[Allegiances](modern-d20-srd-basics-allegiances): A zombie loses any previous [allegiances](modern-d20-srd-basics-allegiances) and adopts a new [allegiance](modern-d20-srd-basics-allegiances) to its creator. This [allegiance](modern-d20-srd-basics-allegiances) cannot be broken.

Saves: A zombies [saving throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) modifiers are based on Hit Dice and given in [Table 82: Creature Saves and Base Attack Bonuses](modern-d20-srd-creatures-creature-overview).

[Action Points](modern-d20-srd-basics-action-points): A zombie does not acquire or amass [action points](modern-d20-srd-basics-action-points). It loses any [action points](modern-d20-srd-basics-action-points) gained by the base creature.

[Reputation Bonus](modern-d20-srd-reputation-index): A zombie has a +0 [Reputation bonus](modern-d20-srd-reputation-index).

[Ability Scores](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores): A zombies [ability scores](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) change as follows: [Str](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) +2, [Dex](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) 2. Additionally, it has no [Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) or [Intelligence](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) score, its [Wisdom](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) changes to 10, and its Charisma decreases to 1.

[Skills](modern-d20-srd-skills-index): The zombie loses all skills.
