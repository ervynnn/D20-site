## Sleep

Enchantment [Mind-Affecting]

[Level](modern-d20-srd-fx-level): [Mage](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-mage) 1; [Components](modern-d20-srd-fx-components): V, S, M; [Casting Time](modern-d20-srd-fx-casting-time); [Attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) [Range](modern-d20-srd-fx-range): Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level); [Area](modern-d20-srd-fx-area): Several living creatures within a 15-ft.-radius burst; [Duration](modern-d20-srd-fx-duration): 1 minute/level; [Saving Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): Will negates; [Spell Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance): Yes

A sleep spell causes a comatose slumber to come upon one or more creatures. Roll 2d4 to determine how many total HD of creatures can be affected. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spells point of origin are affected first. No creature with 5 or more HD is affected, and HD that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted.

Sleeping creatures are [helpless](modern-d20-srd-combat-favorable-unfavorable-conditions). Slapping or wounding awakens affected creatures, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a move action.

Sleep does not affect unconscious creatures, [constructs](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-construct), or [undead](modern-d20-srd-creature-types-undead) creatures.

Note: Additional hit points given along with a creatures Hit Dice are irrelevant for determining how many Hit Dice a creature has.
