## Craft (Visual Art) ([Int](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores))

This skill allows a character to create paintings or drawings, take
photographs, use a video camera, or in some other way create a work of visual
art.

When attempting to create a work of visual art, the character simply makes a
Craft (visual art) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), the result of which determines the quality of the work.

Unless the effort is particularly elaborate or the character must acquire an
expensive piece of equipment, the basic components have a [purchase DC](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check) of 5.


<table> <tr><th>Skill Check Result</th> <th>Effort Achieved</th></tr> <tr><td> 9 or lower</td><td> Untalented amateur </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> 10–19</td><td> Talented amateur </td></tr> <tr><td> 20–24</td><td> Professional </td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td> 25–30</td><td> Expert </td></tr> <tr><td> 31 or higher</td><td> Master </td></tr> </table>


Creating a work of visual art requires at least a [full-round action](modern-d20-srd-combat-full-round-actions), but usually takes an hour,
a day, or more, depending on the scope of the project.

Special: A character with the [Creative](modern-d20-srd-feats-creative) feat
gets a +2 bonus on all Craft (visual art) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).
