     Techno-Organic Makeup
    



     Though the technology of Earth is based on electronics and mechanics, some alien cultures may have developed technology based on living organisms working in harmony for an intended purpose. Additionally, advanced civilizations may make use of certain biological forms of technology integrated with their own mechanical devices to form a techno-organic hybrid capable of performing certain tasks with increased efficiency.
    



     A weapon with the techno-organic makeup gadget is composed of living tissue or a biological/mechanical hybrid material. Unlike normal weapons, the weapon with this gadget heals itself at a rate of one hit point per hour when damaged. Additionally, weapons with this gadget are susceptible to diseases and poisons specifically designed to target techno-organic material.
