## 
    Falling
   



    A character takes 1d6 points of
    [
     damage
    ](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
    for every 10 feet of a fall, to a maximum of 20d6 points. If the character succeeds on a Reflex
    [
     saving
  throw
    ](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
    (DC 10, +1 for each 10 feet fallen), this damage is halved. If the
    [
     saving
  throw
    ](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
    fails, full
    [
     damage
    ](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
    is applied.
   



    A character can make a
    [

[
     check
    ](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index)
    (DC 15) to treat a fall as if it were 10 feet shorter when determining the
    [
     damage
    ](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
    and Reflex
    [
     saving
  throw
    ](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
    DC required by the fall.
