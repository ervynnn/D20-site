## 
     Magic Circle
    



     Abjuration
    



     Level: Divine 3; Components: V, S, DF; Casting Time:
    



     Attack action; Range: Touch; Area: 10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature; Duration: 10 minutes/level; Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless); Spell Resistance: No (see text)
    



     This spell wards an area from attacks by creatures of a specific allegiance (chosen when the spell is cast), from mental control, and from summoned or conjured creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 10 feet. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects:
    



     First, everyone inside the magic circle gains a +2 deflection bonus to Defense and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply only against attacks made by creatures with the specified allegiance.
    



     Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess creatures within the magic circle (as by a possession incantation). The barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast.
    



     Third, the magic circle thwarts any attempt to exert mental control over creatures within its area. If a dominated creature enters the magic circle, mental control is lost for the duration of the magic circle spell or until the creature leaves the protected area.
    



     Fourth, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned or conjured creatures of the specified allegiance. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching a creature inside the magic circle. The protection against contact by summoned or conjured creatures ends if anyone inside the magic circle makes an attack against a blocked creature or the subject tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature.
    



     Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and reach and step inside the magic circle.
