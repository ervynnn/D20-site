## Force Barrier [MINOR]


You can generate an electromagnetic force field around yourself to deflect or absorb incoming attacks.


MP Cost: 3.


Benefit: As a free action, you can generate an invisible electromagnetic barrier around yourself that provides damage reduction 3/– against incoming weapon attacks and force effects. The barrier lasts a number of rounds equal to your current Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). You can create the force field three times per day.


Special: Portable electronic devices such as cell phones, sensor comps, and headsets temporarily cease to function if held or worn by you while the electromagnetic force barrier is in effect.
