## Favorable and Unfavorable Conditions


Generally speaking, any situational modifier created by the attackers position or tactics applies to the attack roll, while any situational modifier created by the defenders position, state, or tactics applies to the defenders [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense). The GM judges what bonuses and penalties apply, using Table: Defense Modifiers and Table: Attack Roll Modifiers as guides.

| Defender climbing | 22 | 22 |
| Defender flat-footed | +02 | +02 |
| Defender running | +02 | +22 |
| Defender grappling (attacker not) | +02 | +03 |

  by [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover). See [Cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover).
2 The defender loses any [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) bonus to [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense).
3 Roll randomly to see which grappling combatant the character strikes. That defender loses any [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) bonus to [Defense](modern-d20-srd-combat-defense).
4 Treat the defenders [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) as 0 (5 modifier). |  |  |
