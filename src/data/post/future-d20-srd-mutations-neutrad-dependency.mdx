## 
    Neutrad Dependency [DRAWBACK]
   



    You rely on a medical compound called neutrad to survive.
   



    MP Value: 6.
   



    Drawback: If you go 24 hours without taking a dose of neutrad you must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 15) or take 1 point of Strength damage and 1 point of Constitution damage. Taking a dose of neutrad cures the ability damage caused by neutrad deprivation in 1d6 rounds. Ability damage caused by neutrad
deprivation cannot be restored through natural healing.
   



    Special: This drawback can be taken only in Progress Level 6 or higher campaigns (when neutrad is available).
