## 
    X-Ray Vision [MAJOR]
   



    You can see into and through solid matter.
   



    MP Cost: 6.
   



    Benefit: X-ray vision allows you to see through 1 foot of brick or stone, 1 inch of metal or composite alloy, and up to 3 feet of wood, plaster, or dirt. Thicker substances or a thin sheet of lead blocks your vision. X-ray vision has a maximum range of 20 feet and allows you to see as if you were looking at something in normal light, even if there is no illumination.
