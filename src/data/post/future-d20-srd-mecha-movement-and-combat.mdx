## Movement and Combat
   



    Combat between mecha is conducted much as it is between characters. Characters operating mecha are simply much larger and stronger than they would otherwise be, and they can wield truly frightening weapons.

They still threaten squares within their reach, take move actions and attack actions, duck behind cover to gain a bonus to Defense, and so forth.

The following sections describe specific situations that arise when mecha maneuver and clash on the battlefield.
