## Rage Implant (PL 7)


This brain implant dramatically increases the amount of adrenaline and testosterone the recipient's body produces, temporarily boosting his strength and durability.


Benefit: The recipient can activate the implant as a free action once per day. Upon doing so, he temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but he takes a '2 penalty to Defense.


The increase in Constitution increases the recipient's hit points by 2 per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the rage when his Constitution score drops back to normal. While raging, the recipient cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except for Balance, Drive, Escape Artist, Intimidate, Pilot, or Ride), the Concentration skill, any abilities that require patience and concentration (including spellcasting and manifesting psionic powers), or any items that must be activated to function.


The rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the recipient's (newly acquired) Constitution modifier. The recipient may prematurely end his rage.


At the end of the rage, the recipient loses the rage modifiers and restrictions and becomes fatigued for the remaining duration of the current encounter.


The increased Constitution triggered by the rage implant in now way obviates the negative levels bestowed for having too many cybernetic attachments.


Type: Internal.


Hardness/Hit Points: '/3.


Base Purchase DC: 24.


Restriction: Restricted (+2).
