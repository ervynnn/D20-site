## 
    Scaly Skin [COSMETIC]
   



    Your flesh becomes thicker and less porous, giving rise to a thin layer of scales covering your flesh. The scales are typically smooth and dry, like those of a snake, and can vary in color and pattern. The scales may not cover your entire body, instead appearing in patches on your face, neck, torso, and limbs.
