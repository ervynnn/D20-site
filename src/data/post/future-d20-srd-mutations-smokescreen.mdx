## 
    Smokescreen [MINOR]
   



    You expel chemicals through your pores to create an inky-black cloud of smoke, engulfing yourself and the surrounding area.
   



    MP Cost: 1.
   



    Benefit: Once per day, as a free action, you can produce a 20-foot-radius cloud of smoke centered on yourself. The cloud is stationary once created. The inky-black smoke obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has onehalf concealment (20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target).
   



    This ability functions underwater. A moderate wind or current disperses the cloud in 4 rounds. A strong wind or current disperses the cloud in 1 round.
