## 
     Displacer (PL 7)
    



     Using the same technology that will someday drive the PL 9 spatial compression engine, the displacer “shifts” the ship a few hundred yards several times a second in a random series of short-range teleportations.
    



     All enemy attacks against the displacing ship have a 30% miss chance, as though it has three-quarters concealment.
    



     A mine can be equipped with a displacer.
    



     Purchase DC: 10 + one-half the base purchase DC of the starship or mine.
    



     Restriction: Military (+3).
