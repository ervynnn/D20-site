## 
    Gills [MINOR]
   



    You grow a set of gills that can draw the oxygen out of water. The gills appear on your neck, chest, or back (near your windpipe or lungs).
MP Cost: 2.
   



    Benefit: You can breathe both air and water. You can operate underwater indefinitely, with no fear of drowning.
