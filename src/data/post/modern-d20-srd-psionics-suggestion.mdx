    Suggestion

[Charisma](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)
[Compulsion, Mind-Affecting, Language-Dependent]

    Level:
    [Telepath](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-telepath)
    2; Display: Audible; Manifestation Time:
    [Attack  action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions)
; Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels); Target: One living creature; Duration: 1 hour/level or until completed;
[Saving Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
: Will negates;
[Power Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-power-resistance)
: Yes; Power Point Cost: 3

    The manifester influences the actions of the target by suggesting a course of action (limited to a sentence or two). The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the action sound reasonable.  The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested action can be completed in a shorter time, the power ends when the subject finishes what he or she was asked to do. The manifester can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special action during the duration. If the condition is not met before the power expires, the action is not performed.




    A very reasonable suggestion causes the
    [saving  throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws)
to be made with a penalty at the discretion of the GM.
