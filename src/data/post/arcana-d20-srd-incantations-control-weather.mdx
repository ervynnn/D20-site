##  Control Weather

Evocation

Skill Check: Knowledge (arcane lore) DC 34, 6 successes; Failure: Two
consecutive failed skill checks; Components: V, S, SC; Casting Time: 60
minutes (minimum); Range: Two miles; Area: Two-mile-radius circle, centered on
you; Duration: 24 hours (D); Saving Throw: None; Spell Resistance: No

You change the weather in the local area. It takes 10 minutes for the effects
to manifest after the incantation is completed. The current, natural weather
conditions are determined by the GM. You can call forth weather appropriate to
the climate and season of the area you are in.


<table> <tr> <th> Season </th> <th> Possible Weather </th> </tr> <tr> <td> Spring </td> <td> Tornado, thunderstorm, sleet storm, or hot weather </td> </tr> <tr class="shaded"> <td> Summer </td> <td> Torrential rain, heat wave, or hailstorm </td> </tr> <tr> <td> Autumn </td> <td> Hot or cold weather, fog, or sleet </td> </tr> <tr class="shaded"> <td> Winter </td> <td> Frigid cold, blizzard, or thaw </td> </tr> <tr> <td> Late winter </td> <td> Hurricane-force winds or early spring (coastal area) </td> </tr> </table>



You control the general tendencies of the weather, such as the direction and
intensity of the wind. You cannot control specific applications of the
weather—where lightning strikes, for example, or the exact path of a tornado.
When you select a certain weather condition to occur, the weather assumes that
condition 10 minutes later (changing gradually, not abruptly). The weather
continues as you left it for the duration, or until you use an attack action
to designate a new kind of weather (which fully manifests itself 10 minutes
later).

Contradictory conditions are not possible simultaneously— fog and strong wind,
for example.

Control weather can do away with atmospheric phenomena (naturally occurring or
otherwise) as well as create them.

Secondary Casters: 12 required (not including the primary caster).

Failure: Mirrorcast. The opposite weather effect manifests over the course of
10 minutes (rain rather than a heat wave, for example, or a thaw rather than a
blizzard). This weather persists for 4d12 hours and cannot be dismissed.
