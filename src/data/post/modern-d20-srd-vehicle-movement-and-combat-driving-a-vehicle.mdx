## Driving a Vehicle

Driving a [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) is a [move action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions), taken by the
[vehicle’s](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) driver. During his or
her [move action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions), the driver moves the
[vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) a number of squares
that falls within its [speed category](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-declaring-speed). The driver can attempt [maneuvers](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-simple-maneuvers) to change the
[vehicle’s](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) course or speed.
These [maneuvers](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-simple-maneuvers)
can be attempted at any point along the [vehicle’s](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) route. The driver can choose to use his or her [attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) to attempt additional
[maneuvers](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-simple-maneuvers).

The two kinds of [vehicle movement](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-moving) are [simple maneuvers](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-simple-maneuvers) and [stunts](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-stunts).

[Simple Maneuvers](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-simple-maneuvers): A [simple maneuver](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-simple-maneuvers), such as a 45-degree turn, is easy to perform. Each is a
[free action](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types) and can be taken as many
times as the driver likes while he or she moves the [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles). However, [simple maneuvers](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-simple-maneuvers) do cost
[movement](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions)—so a [vehicle](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) that makes a lot of [simple maneuvers](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-simple-maneuvers) will
not get as far as one going in a straight line. [Simple maneuvers](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-simple-maneuvers) do not
require the driver to make [skill checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics).

[Stunts](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-stunts):
[Stunts](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-stunts) are difficult and
sometimes daring maneuvers that enable a driver to change his or her
[vehicle’s](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-vehicles) speed or heading more
radically than a [simple maneuver](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-simple-maneuvers) allows. A [stunt](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions) is a
move action. It can be taken as part of a [move action](modern-d20-srd-combat-move-actions) to control the vehicle, and a second [stunt](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-stunts) can be attempted in lieu of the driver’s
[attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions).
[Stunts](modern-d20-srd-vehicle-movement-and-combat-stunts) always require
[Drive](modern-d20-srd-skills-drive) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics).
