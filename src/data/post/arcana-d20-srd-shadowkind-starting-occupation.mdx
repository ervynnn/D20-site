##  Starting Occupation

A character who begins play as a newly arrived Shadowkind must select from the
following starting occupations: hedge wizard, noviate, and squire. In
addition, regardless of the Wealth bonus provided by the starting occupation,
see Starting Wealth Bonus, below.

Only humans and Shadowkind characters born and raised in our mundane world can
select from all starting occupations.
