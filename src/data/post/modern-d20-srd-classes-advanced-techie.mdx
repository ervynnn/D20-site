### Class Features

The following features pertain to the Techie advanced class.

### Jury-Rig

A Techie gains a +2 competence bonus on [Repair](modern-d20-srd-skills-repair)
[skill checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) made
to attempt temporary or jury-rigged repairs. See the [Repair skill](modern-d20-srd-skills-repair) for details on jury-rigging. At 7th
level, this competence bonus increases to +4.

### Extreme Machine


<table style="float: right"> <tr><th colspan="3">Ranged Weapons</th></tr> <tr><th>Improvement</th><th>Craft DC</th><th>Repair Chance (d%)</th></tr> <tr><td>+1 to damage</td><td>15</td><td>01–25</td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td>+2 to damage</td><td>20</td><td>01–50</td></tr> <tr><td>+3 to damage</td><td>25</td><td>01–75</td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td>+5 ft. to range increment</td><td>15</td><td>01–25</td></tr> <tr><td>+10 ft. to range increment</td><td>25</td><td>01–50</td></tr> <tr><th colspan="3">Electronic Devices</th></tr> <tr><th>Improvement</th><th>Craft DC</th><th>Repair Chance (d%)</th></tr> <tr><td>+1 equipment bonus</td><td> 15</td><td> 01–25</td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td>+2 equipment bonus</td><td> 20</td><td> 01–50</td></tr> <tr><td>+3 equipment bonus</td><td> 25</td><td> 01–75</td></tr> <tr><th colspan="3">Vehicles</th></tr> <tr><th>Improvement</th><th>Craft DC</th><th>Repair Chance (d%)</th></tr> <tr><td>+1 on initiative checks</td><td> 20</td><td> 01–25</td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td>+1 to maneuver</td><td> 25</td><td> 01–50</td></tr> <tr><td>+2 to maneuver</td><td> 30</td><td> 01–75</td></tr> </table>



If it has mechanical or electronic components, a Techie of 2nd level or higher
can get maximum performance out of it.

By spending 1 [action point](modern-d20-srd-basics-action-points) and making
either a [Craft (electronic)](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft-electronic) or
[Craft (mechanical)](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft-mechanical)
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (whichever
is appropriate for the machine in question), the Techie can temporarily
improve a machine’s performance—at the risk of causing the machine to need
repairs later. The DC for the [Craft](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft)
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) depends on
the type of improvement being made, as shown on the table below.

The Techie performs the extreme modifications in 1 hour. The Techie can’t
[take 10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) or [take 20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index) on this
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). If the
check succeeds, the effect of the improvement lasts for a number of minutes
equal to his or her Techie class level, beginning when the object is first put
into use. The Techie selects the single improvement he or she wants to make
prior to making the check. After the duration of the effect ends, the machine
reverts to its previous state and a repair chance percentile roll is made. The
result of this roll indicates whether the machine requires repairs before it
can be used again.

### Bonus [Feats](modern-d20-srd-feats-index)

At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Techie gets a bonus [feat](modern-d20-srd-feats-index). The bonus [feat](modern-d20-srd-feats-index) must be selected
from the following list, and the Techie must meet all the prerequisites of the
[feat](modern-d20-srd-feats-index) to select it.

[Builder](modern-d20-srd-feats-builder), [Cautious](modern-d20-srd-feats-cautious), [Combat Expertise](modern-d20-srd-feats-combat-expertise),
[Educated](modern-d20-srd-feats-educated), [Gearhead](modern-d20-srd-feats-gearhead), [Personal Firearms Proficiency](modern-d20-srd-feats-personal-firearms-proficiency), [Point Blank Shot](modern-d20-srd-feats-point-blank-shot), [Studious](modern-d20-srd-feats-studious).

### Build [Robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot)

A Techie of 4th level or higher can build remote-controlled
[robots](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) that are Tiny or Diminutive in size.
These [robots](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) serve as the Techie’s eyes,
ears, or hands out to a predetermined distance away from the character when
the Techie wants to use one of the following skills: [Computer Use](modern-d20-srd-skills-computer-use), [Demolitions](modern-d20-srd-skills-demolitions), [Disable Device](modern-d20-srd-skills-disable-device),
[Listen](modern-d20-srd-skills-listen), [Repair](modern-d20-srd-skills-repair), or [Spot](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot).

The Techie must have at least 1 rank in the skill that he wants to program
into the [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot). The Techie can only control
one [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) at a time, and only one of his
[robots](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) can be active at any time.

Follow these steps to build a [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot).

[Wealth Check](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check): The purchase DC for the
components needed to construct a [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) is
based on the [robot’s](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) size.


<table> <tr><th>Size</th><th>Purchase DC</th></tr> <tr><td>Diminutive</td><td>18</td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td>Tiny</td><td>15</td></tr> </table>



Make the [Wealth check](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check) to purchase and
gather the necessary components prior to starting construction.

Construct Frame: The [robot’s](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) body determines
its size, shape, locomotion, and hit points. The DC of the [Craft (mechanical)](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft-mechanical) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) is set by the
[robot’s](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) size and modified by the form of
locomotion selected.


<table> <tr><th>Size</th><th>Craft DC</th></tr> <tr><td>Diminutive</td><td> 15</td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td>Tiny</td><td> 12</td></tr> </table>



### Components


<table style="float: right"> <tr><th>Frame Shape and Locomotion<sup>1</sup></th><th>DC Modifier</th></tr> <tr><td>Bipedal</td><td> +4</td></tr><tr class="shaded"><td> Quadruped</td><td> +3</td></tr><tr><td> Treads</td><td> +2</td></tr><tr class="shaded"><td> Wheels</td><td> +1</td></tr> <tr><th>External Components<sup>2</sup></th><th>DC Modifier</th></tr> <tr><td>Manipulators<sup>3</sup></td><td> +3</td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td>Audio/visual sensor</td><td> +2</td></tr> <tr><th>Remote Range<sup>1</sup></th><th>DC Modifier</th></tr> <tr><td>Remote control link, 100 feet</td><td> +1</td></tr> <tr class="shaded"><td>Remote control link, 200 feet</td><td> +3</td></tr> <tr><td>Remote control link, 300 feet</td><td> +5 </td></tr> <tr><td colspan="2" style="font-size: .8em"><sup>1</sup> Select only one of the options in this category.<br/> <sup>2</sup> Select one or more of the options in this category.<br/> <sup>3</sup> Necessary for a robot built to use any skill except Listen or Spot.</td></tr> </table>



Select a frame size and form, add manipulators and sensors as necessary, and
choose a type of remote control link. Add all the modifiers to determine the
check’s DC. Make the [Craft (mechanical)](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft-mechanical) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index)
to construct the [robot’s](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) frame.

It takes a Techie 30 hours to construct a Diminutive [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) frame or 12 hours to construct a Tiny [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) frame.

A Diminutive [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) can be 6 to 12 inches
long or tall and weighs about 1 pound. A Tiny [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) can be 13 to 24 inches long or tall and weighs up to 3
pounds. Statistics for these [robots](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) can be
found in the [Creature](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) listings.

Construct the Electronics: The next step is to build the internal electronics
for the [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) and install them in the frame.
The DC is based on the size of the [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) and
modified by the number of components that need to be wired together. For a
Diminutive robot, the DC is 20. For a Tiny [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot), the DC is 15. Add +1 to the DC for each external component and +2 for
the remote link. Make the [Craft (electronic)](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft-electronic) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

It takes a Techie 12 hours to wire a Diminutive [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) or 6 hours to wire a Tiny [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot).

Program the Robot: The Techie programs the [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) as the final step. Decide how many ranks of the appropriate skill to
program into the [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot), up to the number of
ranks the Techie has in the skill. A Techie’s [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) can only contain programming for one skill. Make the
[Computer Use](modern-d20-srd-skills-computer-use) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) to program the
[robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot).

The DC for the [Computer Use](modern-d20-srd-skills-computer-use)
[check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) is 20,
modified by the number of ranks the Techie wants to program into the robot (+1
to the DC for each rank). It takes 1 hour to program the
[robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot).

Reprogramming: A [robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot) can be reprogrammed
at any time. Doing this requires 1 hour of work and a [Computer Use](modern-d20-srd-skills-computer-use) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 20 + the number of ranks programmed into the
[robot](modern-d20-srd-creatures-robot)).

### Mastercraft

At 5th level, the Techie becomes adept at creating
[mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) objects. He of she
applies the [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects)
ability to one of his or her [Craft](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft) skills
([electronic](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft-electronic) or
[mechanical](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft-mechanical)). From this point on, he
or she can build [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects)
objects using that skill.

With [Craft](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft) ([electronic](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft-electronic)), the Techie can build electronic devices. With
[Craft](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft) ([mechanical](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft-mechanical)), the Techie can build mechanical devices, including
weapons.

On average, it takes twice as long to build a [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) object as it does to build an ordinary object
of the same type. The cost to build a [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) object is equal to the purchase DC for the components
(see the appropriate [Craft](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft) skill description) +
the bonus provided by the [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) feature. A Techie can add the [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) feature to an existing ordinary object by making the
[Wealth check](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check) and then making the
[Craft](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) as though he or she were constructing the object
from scratch.

In addition to the [Wealth check](modern-d20-srd-wealth-wealth-check), the
Techie must also pay a cost in experience points equal to 25 x his or her
Techie level x the bonus provided by the [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) feature. The XP must be paid before making the
[Craft](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). If the expenditure of these XP would drop the
Techie to below the minimum needed for his or her current level, then the XP
can’t be paid and the Techie can’t use the [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) ability until he or she gains enough additional
XP to remain at his or her current level after the expenditure is made.

When successfully completed, a [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) object provides a +1 bonus to its quality compared to an
ordinary object of the same type. All weapons and armor, and certain other
types of equipment, such as computers and electronic devices, can be
constructed as [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects)
objects.

At 8th level, the Techie can add the [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) ability to another [Craft](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft)
skill, or he or she can improve his or her ability in the skill selected at
5th level, so that his or her [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) objects provide a +2 bonus.

At 10th level, the Techie adds another +1 bonus to his or her
[mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) ability. If the
Techie focuses his or her ability on one [Craft](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft)
skill, his or her [mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects)
objects now provide a +3 bonus. If the Techie already has the ability for both
[Craft](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft) skills, he or she chooses which one to
improve to a +2 bonus.

The [Craft](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft) DC for a
[mastercraft](modern-d20-srd-equipment-mastercraft-objects) object is the same
as for a normal object of the same type, as described in the
[Craft](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft) skill, with the following modification:
For a +1 object, add +3 to the [Craft](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft) DC; for a
+2 object, add +5 to the [Craft](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft) DC; and for a +3
object, add +10 to the [Craft](modern-d20-srd-skills-craft) DC.
