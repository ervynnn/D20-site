## Agile Riposte

Prerequisites: Dexterity 13, [Dodge](modern-d20-srd-feats-dodge).

Benefit: Once per round, if the opponent the character has designated as his or her [dodge](modern-d20-srd-feats-dodge) target (see the [Dodge](modern-d20-srd-feats-dodge) feat) makes a melee [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) or melee touch [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll) against the character and misses, the character may make an [attack of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity) against that opponent. Resolve and apply the effects from both attacks simultaneously.

Even a character with the [Combat Reflexes](modern-d20-srd-feats-combat-reflexes) feat can’t use the Agile Riposte feat more than once per round. This feat does not grant more [attacks of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity) than the character is normally allowed in a round.
