## Divine Heritage [Initial]

You have divine spellcasting abilities in your background, such as a saint in
your family tree, or you have had a divine experience, revelation, or epiphany
which has left you with modest divine abilities.

**Prerequisite:** Wisdom 10.

**Benefit:** Choose three 0-level divine spells (“orisons”). You may cast each
of these spells once per day per your divine spellcasting level (minimum 1).

**Special:** You may only take this feat as a 1st-level character.
