## Divine Heritage [Initial]


You have divine spellcasting abilities in your background, such as a saint in your family tree, or you have had a divine experience, revelation, or epiphany which has left you with modest divine abilities.


Prerequisite: Wisdom 10.


Benefit: Choose three 0-level divine spells (orisons). You may cast each of these spells once per day per your divine spellcasting level (minimum 1).


Special: You may only take this feat as a 1st-level character.
