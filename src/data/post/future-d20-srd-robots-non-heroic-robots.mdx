## Nonheroic Robots


Most robots exist to perform mundane, routine, or dangerous tasks without argument or ambition. Except for biodroids and bioreplicas with heroic class levels, all robots are treated as constructs and share the general traits outlined below.


Nonheroic robots don't get class levels. However, they can receive factory-installed skill and feat software, allowing them to emulate specific skills and feats as part of their programming (see Skill Software and Feat Software).


### General Robot Traits


As constructs, robots share the following traits that set them apart from organic beings:


Hit Die: d10.


Base Attack Bonus: 3/4 of total Hit Dice.


Good Saving Throws: None.


Skill Points: None.


Feats: None.


Starting Occupation: Robots never get starting occupations. Starting occupations represent life experiences gained before acquiring 1st level. Robots have no
life experiences before rolling off the assembly line; before then, they were nothing but parts.


Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Robots are proficient with their manipulators only. They are not proficient with armor.


Ability Scores: Robots have no Constitution score and usually no Intelligence score. A robot's size and frame determines its ability scores, as shown on Tables 10'1 to 10'5.


Extra Hit Points: Robots gain extra hit points according to their size, as shown on the tables below.


Manipulators: A robot typically has two functioning manipulators, although Large or bigger robots can have a higher number of functioning manipulators based on their size (see Manipulators).


Immunities: As constructs, robots are immune to mind-influencing effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, necromancy effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless. They are not subject to nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, energy drain, or the effects of massive damage.


Robots with armature, biomorph and liquid-state frames are not subject to critical hits. Biodroids and bioreplicas, like the creatures they imitate, have vital areas and critical systems that can be attacked; consequently, they are susceptible to critical hits.


Repairable: Robots cannot heal damage on their own but can be repaired using the Repair skill. A successful Repair check (DC 30) heals 1d10 points of damage to a robot, and each check represents 1 hour of work.


Robot Resurrection: A robot reduced to 0 hit points is immediately destroyed and cannot be repaired, although its brain may be removed and installed in an similar but intact frame. See Robot Resurrection for details.


Weight: A robot is generally heavier than an organic creature of similar size by 1.5.
