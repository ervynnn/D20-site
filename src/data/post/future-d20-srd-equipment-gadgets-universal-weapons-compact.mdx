## 
     Compact
    



     By eliminating wasted space and using smaller components, some engineers are capable of producing weapons far smaller than their standard counterparts. Any weapon that makes use of the compact gadget is one size smaller than normal, to a minimum size of Diminutive.
    



     This gadget can only be added to ranged weapons, as most melee weapons rely on size and mass to deliver damage.
