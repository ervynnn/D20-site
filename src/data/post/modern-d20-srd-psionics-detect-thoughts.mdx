##  Detect Thoughts

[ Charisma ](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) [Mind-Affecting]

Level: [ Telepath ](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-telepath) 2; Display
Visual, Mental; Manifestation Time: Attack action; Range: 60 ft; Area:
Quarter-circle emanating from you to the extreme of the range; Duration:
Concentration, up to 1 minute/level (D); [ Saving Throw ](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) : Will negates (see text); [ Power Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-power-resistance) : No; Power Point Cost: 3

The manifester detects surface thoughts. The amount of information revealed
depends on how long the manifester studies a particular area or subject.

1st Round: Presence or absence of thoughts (from conscious creatures with [Intelligence ](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) scores of 1 or higher).

2nd Round: Number of thinking minds and the mental strength of each.

3rd Round: Surface thoughts of any mind in the area. A target’s [ Will save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) prevents the manifester from reading
its thoughts, and the manifester must manifest detect thoughts again to have
another chance. Creatures of animal [ Intelligence ](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) have simple, instinctual thoughts that the manifester can pick
up.

Each round, the manifester can turn to detect thoughts in a new area. The
power can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a
thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
