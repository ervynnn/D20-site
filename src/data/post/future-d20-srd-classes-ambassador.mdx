### Class Features


The following class features pertain to the Ambassador advanced class.


Diplomatic Immunity
Starting at 1st level, if the Ambassador is arrested for a crime, she can make a Diplomacy check to invoke her diplomatic credentials and not suffer the usual legal penalty or punishment. The severity of the crime determines the DC of the Diplomacy check, and how authorities react if the Ambassador succeeds. See Table: Diplomatic Immunity for Diplomacy check DCs based on the severity of the crime.


If one of the Ambassadors consuls (see the select consul class feature, below) is arrested for a crime and unable to secure her own release, the Ambassador may intercede on the consuls behalf. One may aid the others Diplomacy check.An Ambassador who routinely invokes the privilege of diplomatic immunityeither on her own behalf or to protect her selected consulsis likely to be recalled or terminated by those she has sworn to represent.


| Table: Diplomatic Immunity |  |  |  |
| :---------------------------- | :--: | :--: | --: |
|  |  |  |  |
| Class 5 | Disturbing the peace, public intoxication, noninjurious traffic violation | 15 | 2 penalty on subsequent Diplomacy checks in that area |
| Class 4 | Possession of controlled substance, injurious traffic violation, operating business without a license, operating a vehicle or starship without a license, assault without a deadly weapon | 20 | 5 penalty on subsequent Diplomacy a checks in that area |
| Class 3 | Attempted bribery of a public official, robbery or grand theft, aiding and abetting a known felon, assault with a deadly weapon, possession of a concealed weapon | 25 | 10 penalty on subsequent Diplomacy checks in the area |
| Class 2 | Murder or manslaughter, fraud, smuggling, assault against a public official, trafficking in controlled substances | 30 | Deportation within 2d6 hours |
| Class 1 | Conspiracy against the government, murder of a public official, sabotage of public utilities | 35 | Detention pending the diplomatic action by characters affiliated government |



Open Arms
Beginning at 2nd level, the Ambassador is skilled at initiating peaceful negotiations. She may add a competence bonus equal to one-half her Ambassador class level on all Diplomacy checks.


Bonus Feats
At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Ambassador gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Ambassador must meet all the prerequisites of the feat to select it. Attentive, Defensive Martial Arts, Dodge, Educated, Improved Initiative, Low Profile, Oathbound, Renown, Trustworthy.


Information Access
Starting at 4th level, the Ambassador can make Gather Information checks without spending money or making Wealth checks, provided she is dealing with individuals or organizations that are helpful, friendly, indifferent, or unfriendly toward her or those she represents. Dealing with individuals or organizations that are hostile requires the Ambassador to make Wealth checks as usual when using the Gather Information skill.


Stipend
Skilled diplomats are well paid for their loyalty and dedication, and they are accustomed to traveling in style. At 5th level, and again at 8th level, the Ambassador gains a one-time Wealth bonus increase of +4.


Restricted Access
At 7th level, the Ambassador gains clearance to access restricted files or classified information from any source that recognizes her faction, organization, nation, world, or stellar empire. She gains a +5 bonus on Computer Use checks made to defeat computer security and a +5 bonus on Research checks.


Select Consuls
At 10th level, the Ambassador may appoint a number of individuals equal to her Reputation bonus as consuls or attachés. These appointed individuals gain all the benefits of the diplomatic immunity, information access, and restricted access class features (described above). The Ambassador may revoke these privileges at any time and appoint replacement consuls as she sees fit. It takes 1d4 hours for an Ambassador to invoke or revoke a consuls or attachés privileges.
