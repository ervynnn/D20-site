## Treat Injury (Wis)
   



    This skill can be used to treat members of other species, provided they are neither constructs nor undead.
   



    Check: For all uses of this skill except surgery, the skill check’s DCs are unchanged.
   



    Performing surgery on creatures of a type different from your own carries a –8 penalty. The Surgery feat reduces the penalty to –4, while the Xenomedic feat negates the penalty entirely.
   



    Special: The Treat Injury skill cannot be used on nonliving or inorganic creatures, such as constructs or undead.
