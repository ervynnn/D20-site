## Light Starship Subtypes


Light starships include corvettes, frigates, destroyers, haulers, and industrial ships, such as garbage barges and fuel carriers. Light starships are somewhat better armed and armored than ultralight starships, but sacrifice a little in the way of speed.


A light starship measures 251-500 feet long. It has a 500-footby- 500-foot fighting space and occupies a single 500-foot square. In addition, all light starships share the following design specs.


Engines: All light starships have thrusters plus one other type of engine (see Starship Engines).


Armor: A light starship has one type of armor (see Starship Armor).


Defensive Systems: A light starship has a maximum of one defensive system per 10 Hit Dice (see Starship Defense Systems).


Sensors: A light starship has a maximum of two sensor systems (see Starship Sensors).


Communications: A light starship has up to two external communication systems (see Starship Comm Systems).


Weapons: A light starship has one beam, projectile, or missile weapon per 10 Hit Dice (see Starship Weapons). These weapons are often fire-linked. A light starship cannot be armed with mines.


Grappling Systems: A light starship may have up to two grappling systems (see Grappling Systems). Each grappling
system takes away one of the ship's weapon slots (see above).
