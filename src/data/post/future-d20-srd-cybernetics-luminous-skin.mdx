## Luminous Skin (PL 7)

Special skin grafts create luminous displays on the recipients flesh. Most recipients use it purely for decoration, but the same technology can provide a built-in chronometer.

Benefit: The recipient can control the brightness of the luminescence as a free action, negating it entirely if desired. As its most intense, luminous skin can illuminate squares occupied by or adjacent to the recipient. The chronometer serves the same function as a wristwatch, including date, time, and alarm functions.

Type: Internal.

Hardness/Hit Points: / (luminous skin ceases to function when the recipient is killed).

Base Purchase DC: 4 (6 for chronometer version).

Restriction: None.
