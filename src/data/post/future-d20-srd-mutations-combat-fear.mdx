## Combat Fear [DRAWBACK]


Due to a chemical imbalance in your brain, you are gripped by an inexplicable fear whenever you face a dangerous or frightening situation.


MP Value: 4.


Drawback: After initiative is rolled but before you take your first action in combat, make a Will saving throw (DC 15). If you fail the Will save, you are shaken for the rest of the encounter, taking a '2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks. If the save succeeds, you overcome your moment of fear and negate the ill effects.
