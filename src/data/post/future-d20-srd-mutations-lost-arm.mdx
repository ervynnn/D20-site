## Lost Arm [DRAWBACK]


One of your arms withers or gets eaten away, leaving behind a stump.


MP Value: 3.


Drawback: You lose one arm of your choice. You cannot effectively wield weapons that require two hands. In addition, you take a '2 penalty on Climb checks, Swim checks, and grapple checks.


Special: You can replace your lost arm with a cybernetic replacement arm, assuming such technology is available and you can afford it.
