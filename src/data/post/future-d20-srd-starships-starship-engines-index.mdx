## Starship Engines


A starship's engine determines how fast the ship moves. The more efficient the engine, the faster it can move the shipÂ—and the more expensive it is. In addition, certain low-tech engines burn fuel of some sort, increasing the operational cost. In space, fuel-burning engines rely on vector jets to adjust their course, using fuel only in short, controlled burns to increase momentum.


To build a starship engine from scratch, a character must succeed at a Craft (mechanical) check (DC 30) after investing 120 hours in its assembly. A character without a mechanical tool kit takes a '4 penalty on the skill check. The character must also make a Wealth check against the engine's purchase DC.


Installing an engine requires a successful Craft (mechanical) check (DC 30) after investing 60 hours in the process. A character without a mechanical tool kit takes a '4 penalty on the skill check.


The various types of engines are listed below.


Minimum Ship Size: The minimum size the starship must be to have this type of engine.


Tactical Speed Bonus: The bonus that the engine provides to the starship's tactical speed, given in feet and squares.


Purchase DC: The engine's purchase DC.
