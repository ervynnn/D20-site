##  Spell Focus

Choose a school of magic, such as Evocation or Illusion. Your spells of that
school are more potent than normal.

**Benefit:** Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against
spells from the school of magic you select to focus on.

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack.
Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new school of magic.
