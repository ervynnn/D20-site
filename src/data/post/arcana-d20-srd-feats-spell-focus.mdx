## 
    Spell Focus
   



    Choose a school of magic, such as Evocation or Illusion. Your spells of that school are more potent than normal.
   




     Benefit:
    
    Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against spells from the school of magic you select to focus on.
   




     Special:
    
    You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new school of magic.
