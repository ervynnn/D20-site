## Chaff Launcher (PL 6)

Chaff consists of a cloud of millions of tiny metal strips or particles. This detritus interferes with sensors and missiles. Deploying chaff usually via a small bundle from the rear or underside of a starshipis a move action. The chaff fills one 500-foot square with these strips or particles. Sensor scans directed at anything within the square take a 10 penalty, and scanning something on the direct opposite side of the chaff field incurs a 5 penalty. Any missile that passes through the chaff field to reach its intended target suffers a 30% miss chance (as though the target has three-quarters concealment).

Purchase DC: 20 for chaff launcher and one chaff bundle, 15 for each additional chaff bundle.

Restriction: Licensed (+1).
