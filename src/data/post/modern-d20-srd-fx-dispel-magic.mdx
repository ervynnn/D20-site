A caster can use dispel magic to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a [magic item](modern-d20-srd-fx-items-index), to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) the ongoing effects of supernatural abilities as well as spells. Dispel magic affects spell-like effects just as it affects spells.

Note: The effects of spells with instantaneous duration can’t be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect.

The caster chooses to use dispel magic in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or an area dispel:

Targeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the spell. The caster makes a dispel check against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. A dispel check is 1d20 +1 per caster level (maximum +10) against a DC of 11 + the spell’s caster level.

If the spellcaster targets an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell, he or she makes a dispel check to end the spell.

If the object that is targeted is a magic item, the caster makes a dispel check against the item’s caster level. If the caster succeeds, all the item’s magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. The item’s physical properties are unchanged:

A caster automatically succeeds on his or her dispel check against any spell that he or she cast.

Area Dispel: The spell affects everything within a 30-foot radius.

For each creature that is the target of one or more spells, the caster makes a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that fails, the caster makes dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until he or she dispels one spell (which discharges the dispel so far as that target is concerned) or fails all the checks. The creature’s magic items are not affected.

For each object that is the target of one or more spells, the caster make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by area dispels.

For each ongoing area or effect spell centered within the dispel magic’s area, the caster makes a dispel check to dispel the spell.

For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the dispel, the caster makes a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the area of the dispel magic.

A caster may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that he or she has cast.
