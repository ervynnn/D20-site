[Future D20 SRD]( / ) > Starships




## Magnetic Field (PL 6)


The magnetic field is the first primitive energy shield. It uses vast amounts of power to surround the ship with potent lines of magnetic force. Missiles and weapons that deal ballistic damage fired at a starship with a magnetic field take a '4 penalty on attack rolls.


A mine can be equipped with a magnetic field.


Purchase DC: 5 + one-half the base purchase DC of the starship or mine.


Restriction: Military (+3).
