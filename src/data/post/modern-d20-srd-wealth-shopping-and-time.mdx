##  Shopping and Time

Buying less common [ objects ](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-general)
generally takes a number of hours equal to the purchase DC of the [ object](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-general) or [ service ](modern-d20-srd-equipment-services) , reflecting the time needed to locate the wanted
materials and close the deal. Getting a license or buying an [ object](modern-d20-srd-equipment-equipment-general) with a [ restriction](modern-d20-srd-equipment-restricted-objects) rating increases the time
needed to make purchases.
