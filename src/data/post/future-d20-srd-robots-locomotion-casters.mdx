## Casters (PL 6)


The robot moves about on spherical wheels, or casters. These are somewhat more efficient than wheels and enable the robot to change direction easily. Robots with casters cannot jump or swim.


Base Speed: 20 feet.


Purchase DC: One-quarter the base purchase DC of the robotâ€™s frame.
