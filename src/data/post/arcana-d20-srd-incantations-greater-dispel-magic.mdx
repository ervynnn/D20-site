##  Greater Dispel Magic

Abjuration

Skill Check: Knowledge (arcane lore) DC 31, 4 successes, and Spellcraft DC 31,
2 successes; Failure: Two consecutive failed skill checks; Components: V, S,
M, B; Casting Time: 60 minutes (minimum); Range: 220 ft.; Target: One
spellcaster, creature, or object; or 30-ft.-radius burst; Duration:
Instantaneous; Saving Throw: None; Spell Resistance: No

As the dispel magic spell, except that the bonus on the dispel check is +15,
not the caster level. Additionally, greater dispel magic has a chance to
dispel any effect that remove curse can remove, even if dispel magic canâ€™t
dispel that effect.

Material Component: Various rare incenses, herbs, and reagents (purchase DC
20).

Backlash: Caster takes 4d6 points of damage.

Failure: Augment. One characteristic of the magical effect targeted (area,
range, duration, etc.) doubles. The target spell might deal twice as much
damage or a curse might bestow twice the penalty, for example. The GM
determines which aspect of the target spell is so augmented.
