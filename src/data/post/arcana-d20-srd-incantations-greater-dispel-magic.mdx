## 
     Greater Dispel Magic
    



     Abjuration
    



     Skill Check: Knowledge (arcane lore) DC 31, 4 successes, and Spellcraft DC 31, 2 successes; Failure: Two consecutive failed skill checks; Components: V, S, M, B; Casting Time: 60 minutes (minimum); Range: 220 ft.; Target: One spellcaster, creature, or object; or 30-ft.-radius burst; Duration: Instantaneous; Saving Throw: None; Spell Resistance: No
    



     As the dispel magic spell, except that the bonus on the dispel check is +15, not the caster level. Additionally, greater dispel magic has a chance to dispel any effect that remove curse can remove, even if dispel magic cant dispel that effect.
    



     Material Component: Various rare incenses, herbs, and reagents (purchase DC 20).
    



     Backlash: Caster takes 4d6 points of damage.
    



     Failure: Augment. One characteristic of the magical effect targeted (area, range, duration, etc.) doubles. The target spell might deal twice as much damage or a curse might bestow twice the penalty, for example. The GM determines which aspect of the target spell is so augmented.
