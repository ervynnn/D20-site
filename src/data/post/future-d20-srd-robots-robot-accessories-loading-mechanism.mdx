## 
     Loading Mechanism (PL 5)
    



     A loading mechanism allows a robot to reload a single handheld weapon as a full-round action. The mechanism can hold enough ammunition to reload the weapon three times. The mechanism works with weapons that use box ammunition, speed-loaders (but not loose bullets), a grenade launcher round, some sort of fuel tank (such as a flamethrower) or power cell.
    



     A robot can have multiple loading mechanismsÂ—one for each weapon it carries.
    



     Purchase DC: 12 (doesn't include ammunition).
    



     Restriction: None.
