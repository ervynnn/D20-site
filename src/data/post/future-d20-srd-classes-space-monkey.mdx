Hibernation Trance
A Space Monkey can enter a deep trance that allows him to gain the full benefits of sleep or bed rest in half the usual
time. 


Monkey’s Wrench
Space Monkeys use tools expertly and creatively. Starting at 2nd level, a Space Monkey gains a competence bonus equal to one-half his Space Monkey class level on skill checks made when using a tool kit. This bonus stacks with the tool kit’s normal equipment bonus.

Monkeys Unite
Space Monkeys fight better together. Starting at 4th level, a Space Monkey gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls when fighting adjacent to another Space Monkey.


Furthermore, a Space Monkey gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against an opponent flanked by another Space Monkey; this bonus is in addition to the usual +2 bonus for flanking.


Know Location
At 5th level, a Space Monkey gains a +2 competence bonus on Navigate and Survival checks to avoid becoming lost. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level.


Monkey Shines
Upon reaching 7th level, a Space Monkey has learned sneaky tactics. He can use the Bluff technique of feinting in combat as a move action, allowing him to feint and attack in the same round.


If the Space Monkey also has the Improved Feint feat, he gains a +4 bonus (instead of the feat’s usual +2 bonus) on Bluff checks made to feint in combat.


Space Suitable
At 8th level, a Space Monkey becomes more comfortable in armor. He treats any suit of armor as though its armor penalty and maximum Dexterity bonus were 1 better.


Monkey Shot
By spending an action point at the end of his turn, a 10th-level Space Monkey gains an extra attack at his full attack
bonus. (Remember that a character can spend only one action point per round.)
