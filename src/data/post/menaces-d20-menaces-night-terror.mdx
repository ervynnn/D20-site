## 
     Night Terror
    



     A night terror stands 5 to 6 feet tall and weighs between 120 and 200 pounds. Although it is always horrific and feral, the details of the creatures appearance can vary widely. The typical specimen is almost impossible to describe because it can alter its appearance based on the specific fears of its victim.
    


### 
     Species Traits
    



     Bonus Feat: A night terror gains Simple Weapons Proficiency as a bonus feat.
    



     Chosen Victim (Ex): A night terror can feed on the terror of only one individual at a time. Once it chooses its victim, it can choose another only upon the death of the previous victim or by making a successful Will save (DC 25).
    



     Fear Aura (Su): A night terror projects a frightful aura that affects all creatures within 30 feet. Creatures in the area that can see the night terror must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the night terrors Hit Dice + its Charisma modifier). Those that fail the save are shaken. The night terrors chosen victim is left cowering instead of shaken. Creatures that successfully save against a night terrors fear aura cannot be affected by that particular night terrors fear aura for 24 hours.
    



     Immune to Fear (Ex): Night terrors are immune to fear effects.
    



     Selective Invisibility (Su): Once the night terror has chosen its victim, only that individual can see it. To everyone else, the creature is invisible, as the invisibility spell (caster level 10th). If the night terror attacks anyone, it becomes visible to all viewers until the next sunrise.
    



     Skill Bonuses: A night terror gains a +4 species bonus on Intimidate and Sense Motive checks during the night. It loses these bonuses during daylight hours.
    



     Terrify (Su): Once per night as a full-round action, the night terror can try to feed upon the fear of its chosen victim. The victim must make a successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the night terrors Hit Dice + its Charisma modifier) or take 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. The night terror can attempt to use this ability only if it has already successfully used its fear aura against the target. If this Wisdom damage would cause the chosen victims Wisdom score to fall below 0, the victim must make another Will save. Success leaves the victims Wisdom score at 0; failure means the victim dies on the spot.
    



     Vulnerability (Ex): Each night terror has a specific irrational weakness that varies with the individual. For each night terror, roll on Table: Sources of Weakness on. Regardless of its nature, the weakness has overpowering strength (Will save DC 20) and causes the aversion effect.
