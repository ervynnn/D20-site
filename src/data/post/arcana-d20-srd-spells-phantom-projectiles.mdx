## Phantom Projectiles

Transmutation

Level: Arcane 5; Components: V, S, M; Casting Time: Attack action; Range:
Touch; Target: 50 projectiles, all of which must be in contact with each other
at the time of casting; Duration: 1 hour/level; Saving Throw: Will negates
(harmless, object); Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless, object)

You turn ammunition (such as arrows, bolts, bullets, and shuriken) into
incorporeal projectiles that damage only their intended targets.

Phantom projectiles pass through intervening obstacles (including armor) and
thus ignore cover bonuses and equipment bonuses to Defense. Barriers of
magical force, such as a wall of force, stops them. Phantom bullets count as
having a +3 enhancement bonus for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction,
although they donâ€™t actually receive the enhancement bonus on attacks or
damage. Additionally, the phantom bullets disappear 1d4 rounds after being
fired, making it impossible to gather ballistic evidence.

Material Component: In addition to the bullets, the caster needs a small chunk
of lithium.
