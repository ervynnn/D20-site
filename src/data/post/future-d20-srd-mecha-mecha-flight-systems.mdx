## Mecha Flight Systems


All mecha are equipped with legs that allow them to walk and run. A mecha’s size determines its base speed, as noted in Table: Mecha Sizes. This section describes various optional flight systems. To build a flight system from scratch, a character must succeed at a Craft (mechanical) check (DC 30) after investing 60 hours in its assembly. A character without a mechanical tool kit takes a –4 penalty on the skill check. The character must also make a Wealth check against the flight system’s purchase DC.


### Afterburner System (PL 6)


The afterburner system dumps a shot of raw fuel into the mecha’s thruster system, giving the mecha a temporary speed boost. The mecha’s fly speed is doubled for 1 round. The afterburner system is good for only one use; additional activations require additional afterburner systems.



Equipment Slots: 1, must be torso, back, or leg.
Activation: Free action.
Range: Personal.
Target: You.
Duration: 1 round.
Saving Throw: None.
Purchase DC: 8 + one-quarter the mecha’s base purchase DC.
Restriction: None.



### Jetpack (PL 6)


A jetpack combines vectored thrust with simple avionics, granting the mecha a fly speed of 100 feet (clumsy). The jetpack carries enough fuel for the mecha to travel a total of 1,000 feet; refueling has a purchase DC of 16.



Equipment Slots: 1, must be back or boots; or 2, must be left leg and right leg.
Activation: Free action.
Range: Personal.
Target: You.
Duration: Persistent.
Saving Throw: None.
Purchase DC: 10 + one-quarter the mecha’s base purchase DC.
Restriction: None.



### Jet-Assist Wings (PL 7)


Jet-assist wings allow a flying mecha to maneuver more effectively, but do not provide the mecha with the ability to fly. A mecha with jet-assist wings improves its flight maneuverability by one category (clumsy to poor, poor to average, and so on).



Equipment Slots: 1, must be back or shoulders (Large or Huge); 2, must be back or shoulders (Gargantuan or Colossal).
Activation: None.
Range: Personal.
Target: You.
Duration: Persistent.
Saving Throw: None.
Purchase DC: 5 + one-quarter the mecha’s purchase DC.
Restriction: None.



### Thruster Boots (PL 7)


Thruster boots combine powerful fusion thrusters to give the mecha a fly speed of 150 feet (poor).



Equipment Slots: 1, must be boots.
Activation: None.
Range: Personal.
Target: You.
Duration: Persistent.
Saving Throw: None.
Purchase DC: 10 + one-quarter the mecha’s purchase DC.
Restriction: None.



### Ramjet Thruster Boots (PL 8)


The best thruster system available uses ramjet technology to improve the performance of the PL 7 thruster boots, granting the mecha a fly speed of 200 feet (poor).



Equipment Slots: 1, must be boots.
Activation: None.
Range: Personal.
Target: You.
Duration: Persistent.
Saving Throw: None.
Purchase DC: 10 + one-quarter the mecha’s purchase DC.
Restriction: None.
