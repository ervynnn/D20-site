     Kinori

###

     Species Traits




     Cold Resistance 20 (Ex): A kinori ignores the first 20 points of cold damage from any single attack.




     Easy Breathing (Ex): Since a kinori requires much less oxygen to breathe than a human does, the creature can hold its breath for up to an hour. If exposed to a dangerous inhaled effect, a kinori gains a +5 species bonus on any required saving throw.




     Light Sensitivity (Ex): A kinori takes a 2 penalty on attack rolls, checks, and saves in sunlight or other bright light.




     Skill Bonus: A kinori can turn its skin white as a free action, much as a chameleon changes its color. It gains a +4 species bonus on Hide checks when concealed against a white background, such as snow and ice.
