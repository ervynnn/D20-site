##  Kinori

###  Species Traits

Cold Resistance 20 (Ex): A kinori ignores the first 20 points of cold damage
from any single attack.

Easy Breathing (Ex): Since a kinori requires much less oxygen to breathe than
a human does, the creature can hold its breath for up to an hour. If exposed
to a dangerous inhaled effect, a kinori gains a +5 species bonus on any
required saving throw.

Light Sensitivity (Ex): A kinori takes a â€“2 penalty on attack rolls, checks,
and saves in sunlight or other bright light.

Skill Bonus: A kinori can turn its skin white as a free action, much as a
chameleon changes its color. It gains a +4 species bonus on Hide checks when
concealed against a white background, such as snow and ice.
