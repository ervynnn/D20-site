### Boost Armor


Boost armor is powered armor that augments the characters physical abilities. A character wearing boost armor is stronger, faster, and more nimble than ever before. Special mechanisms augment physical strength, granting a +4 bonus to the characters Strength score. Sensors can detect incoming attacks and augment reaction times, granting a +2 bonus on all Reflex saves.


Additionally, boost armor can improve traction and augment the ability to move quickly, increasing the characters movement speed by 10 feet. Boost armor is lightweight and form-fitting, and provides less protection than heavier combat armors.


### Unisoldier Heavy Combat Armor


The ultimate step in the creation of the one-soldier army, unisoldier heavy combat armor is an all-in-one package that makes the wearer a formidable opponent in combat. The wearer is covered from head to toe. The helmet includes a built-in heads-up display and a visor that changes tint to dampen the effects of sudden bright lights, making flash-bang grenades useless against the wearer. Additionally, the armor usually has built-in slots for the addition of onboard computer systems, though not all armors make use of the option.
