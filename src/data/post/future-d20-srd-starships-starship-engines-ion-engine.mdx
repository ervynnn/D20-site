## Ion Engine (PL 6)


The ion engine generates power to break down molecules of a fuel material to create ions, and then expels them by means of a magnetic impeller. It doesn't provide as effective a mass-thrust ratio as the fusion torch, but it's more fuel efficient, and its exhaust is not nearly as dangerous. Ion engines don't function in any kind of atmosphere, so most ships with this kind of power plant also come equipped with thrusters.


A ship using an ion engine as its primary source of propulsion must refuel after every five battles or interplanetary trips. Ion engine fuel has a purchase DC of 29.


Minimum Ship Size: Huge.


Tactical Speed Bonus: +500 feet (+1 square).


Purchase DC: 15 + one-half the base purchase DC of the starship.
