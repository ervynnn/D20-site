## Elusive Target

Prerequisites: [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) 13, [Defensive Martial Arts](modern-d20-srd-feats-defensive-martial-arts).

Benefit: When fighting an opponent or multiple opponents in melee, other opponents attempting to target the character with [ranged attacks](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) take a –4 penalty. This penalty is in addition to the normal –4 penalty for firing into melee, making the penalty to target to character –8.

Special: An opponent with the [Precise Shot](modern-d20-srd-feats-precise-shot) feat has the penalty lessened to –4 when targeting the character.
