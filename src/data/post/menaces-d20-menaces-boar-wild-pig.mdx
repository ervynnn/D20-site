##  Boar (Wild Pig)

A wild boar’s hide is covered with short, woolly, grayishblack hair. Along the
spine, hair mixes with stiffer bristles to form a sort of mane. The average
adult boar stands 3 feet high at the shoulder and measures roughly 4 feet
long. Its formidable tusks protrude from its lower jaw and can grow up to 12
inches long.
