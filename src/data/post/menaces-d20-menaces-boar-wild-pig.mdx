## 
     Boar (Wild Pig)
    



     A wild boars hide is covered with short, woolly, grayishblack hair. Along the spine, hair mixes with stiffer bristles to form a sort of mane. The average adult boar stands 3 feet high at the shoulder and measures roughly 4 feet long. Its formidable tusks protrude from its lower jaw and can grow up to 12 inches long.
