## 
     Acid Rainer
    


### 
     Species Traits
    



     Acid Resistance 10 (Ex): An acid rainer ignores the first 10 points of acid damage from any single attack.
    



     Acid Spray (Ex): Once every 1d4 rounds, an acid rainer can spray out a cloud of caustic mist that fills a 30-foot radius spread centered on itself. Each creature within this area takes 2d6 points of acid damage, or half damage if a Reflex save succeeds (DC 10 + 1/2 the acid rainers Hit Dice + its Constitution modifier).
    



     Acid Touch (Ex): An acid rainers tentacles are coated with a caustic secretion that deals 1d6 points of acid damage on a successful hit.
    



     Elemental: An acid rainer has the traits and immunities common to elementals.
    



     Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the acid rainer must hit a single opponent at least one size category smaller than itself with two tentacle attacks during the same round. If it gets a hold, it automatically deals damage for two tentacle attacks (including acid) each round that the hold is maintained.
    



     Skill Bonuses: An acid rainer gains a +8 species bonus on Hide checks and a +4 species bonus on Move Silently checks.
