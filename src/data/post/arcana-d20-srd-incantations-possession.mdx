     Possession




     Necromancy




     Skill Check: Knowledge (arcane lore) DC 34, 6 successes; Failure: Two consecutive failed skill checks; Components: V, S, M, XP; Casting Time: 60 minutes (minimum); Range: Touch; Target: One helpless creature of fewer Hit Dice than you; Duration: 12 hours (D); Saving Throw: Will negates (DC 16 + casters Charisma modifier); Spell Resistance: Yes




     By casting the possession incantation, you place the subjects soul in a receptacle (a gem or large crystal) while your soul inhabits the subjects body, leaving your body lifeless. Then you can attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the receptacle. The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own body (restoring the subjects soul to its body and causing the receptacle to crumble into dust).




     You possess the body and force the creatures soul into the receptacle unless the subject succeeds at a Will save. Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in your body, and the receptacle turns to dust. If successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the hosts life force is imprisoned in the receptacle. You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities.




     The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You cant choose to activate the bodys extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The creatures spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body.




     As an attack or move action, you can send the trapped soul back to its body and return to yours. This ends the spell.




     If the host body is slain, you return to your body and the life force of the host departs (that is, it is dead). If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body and the soul in the receptacle returns to its body. Destroying the receptacle ends the spell and returns both souls to their original bodies. The spell can be dispelled at either the receptacle or the host.




     When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead.




     Material Component: A large gem or crystal (purchase DC 25).




     Experience Point Cost: 1,000 XP.




     Failure: Mirrorcast. You wind up trapped inside the receptacle, and the subjects soul inhabits your body.
