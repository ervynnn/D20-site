## Sleight of Hand (Dex) Trained

    Only; Armor Penalty

[Check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index): A [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) against DC 10 lets a character palm a coin-sized, unattended object. Minor feats of sleight of hand, such as making a coin disappear, also have a DC of 10 unless an observer is concentrating on noticing what the character is doing.

When a character performs this skill under close observation, the characters skill check is opposed by the observers [Spot](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). The observers [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) doesnt prevent the character from performing the action, just from doing it unnoticed.
When a character tries to take something from another person, the characters opponent makes a [Spot](modern-d20-srd-skills-spot) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) to detect the attempt. To obtain the object, the character must get a result of 20 or higher, regardless of the opponents [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) result. The opponent detects the attempt if his or her [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) result beats the characters check result, whether the character takes the object or not.

A character can use Sleight of Hand to conceal a small weapon or object on his or her body.

Try Again?: A second Sleight of Hand attempt against the same target, or when being watched by the same observer, has a DC 10 higher than the first [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) if the first [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) failed or if the attempt was noticed.

Special: A character can [take 10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index) when making a Sleight of Hand [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), but cant [take 20](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take20-index).

A character can make an untrained Sleight of Hand [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) to conceal a weapon or object, but must always [take 10](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#take10-index).

A character with the [Nimble](modern-d20-srd-feats-nimble) feat and at least 1 rank in this skill gets a +2 bonus on all Sleight of Hand [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

Time: A Sleight of Hand [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) is an [attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions).
