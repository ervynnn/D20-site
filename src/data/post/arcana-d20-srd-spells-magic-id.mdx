Illusion

Level: Arcane 0; Components: V, S, F; Casting Time: Attack action; Range:

Throw: Will disbelief (if interacted with); Spell Resistance: No

With this glamer, you make a small card or slip of paper appear to be a valid
identification card of your choosing. The card bears your name, likeness, and
all other data expected by anyone examining such a card. However, it is only
visually accurate and does not contain any valid machine-readable data or
electronic coding. You cannot use this spell to make an electronic passkey.
The illusion lasts only as long as you touch the card, to a maximum of 5
rounds.

Focus: A small card or slip of paper.
