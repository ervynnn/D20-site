The items described here represent special clothing types, or unusual outfits
that a character might need to purchase.

For the most part, clothing choice is based on character concept. It’s
generally assumed that a hero owns a reasonable wardrobe of the sorts of
clothes that fit his or her lifestyle. Sometimes, however, a character might
need something out of the ordinary. When that’s the case, he or she will have
to purchase it like any other piece of gear. Clothes have two effects on game
mechanics: one on [Disguise](modern-d20-srd-skills-disguise)
[checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index), and one on
[Sleight of Hand](modern-d20-srd-skills-sleight-of-hand)
[checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index).

First, clothing is part of a disguise. See the [Disguise](modern-d20-srd-skills-disguise) skill description for more on how appropriate dress affects
Disguise checks.

Clothes also help to hide firearms, body armor, and small objects. Tightly
tailored clothing imposes a penalty on an attempt to conceal an object;
clothing purposely tailored to conceal objects provides a bonus.

### Clothing Outfit

An outfit of clothing represents everything a character needs to dress a part:
pants or skirt, shirt, undergarments, appropriate shoes or boots, socks or
stockings, and any necessary belt or suspenders. The clothes a character wears
does not count against the weight limit for encumbrance.

Business: A business outfit generally includes a jacket or blazer, and it
tends to look sharp and well groomed without being overly formal.

Casual: Casual clothes range from cut-off jeans and a T-shirt to neatly
pressed khakis and a hand-knit sweater.

Formal: From a little black dress to a fully appointed tuxedo, formal clothes
are appropriate for “black tie” occasions. Special designer creations can have
purchase DCs much higher than shown on the table.

Fatigues: Called “battle dress uniforms” (or BDUs) in the United States Army,
these are worn by hardened veterans and wannabes alike. They’re rugged,
comfortable, and provide lots of pockets. They are also printed in camouflage
patterns: woodland, desert, winter (primarily white), urban (gray patterned),
and black are available. When worn in an appropriate setting, fatigues grant a
+2 bonus on Hide checks.

Uniform: From the cable guy to a senior Air Force officer, people on the job
tend to wear uniforms—making such clothing an essential part of some
disguises, since a uniform inclines people to trust the wearer.

### Ghillie Suit

The ultimate in camouflage, a ghillie suit is a loose mesh overgarment covered
in strips of burlap in woodland colors, to which other camouflaging elements
can easily be added. A figure under a ghillie suit is nearly impossible to
discern.

A character wearing a ghillie suit with appropriate coloration gains a +10
bonus on [Hide](modern-d20-srd-skills-hide) [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). (The suit’s coloration can be changed
with a move action. However, the bulky suit imposes a penalty of –4 on all
[Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) checks,
[Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-skills-hide)-based skill [checks](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (except Hide), and melee [attack rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll).

### Outerwear

In addition to keeping a character warm and dry, coats and jackets provide
additional concealment for things a character is carrying (they often qualify
as loose or bulky clothing; see [Concealed Weapons and Objects](modern-d20-srd-equipment-concealed-weapons-objects)).

Coat: An outer garment worn on the upper body. Its length and style vary
according to fashion and use.

Fatigue Jacket: A lightweight outer garment fashioned after the fatigue
uniforms worn by military personnel when performing their standard duties.

Overcoat: A warm coat worn over a suit jacket or indoor clothing.

Parka: This winter coat grants the wearer a +2 equipment bonus on [Fortitude saves](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) made to resist the effects of cold
weather.

Photojournalist’s Vest: Made of cotton with mesh panels to keep the wearer
cool, the photojournalist’s vest has numerous obvious—and hidden—pockets. It
counts as loose and bulky clothing when used to conceal Small or smaller
weapons, and also grants the “specially modified to conceal object” bonus when
used to conceal Tiny or smaller objects. See [Concealed Weapons and Objects](modern-d20-srd-equipment-concealed-weapons-objects).

Windbreaker: This is a lightweight jacket made of wind-resistant material.

### Tool Belt

This sturdy leather belt has numerous pockets and loops for tools, nails,
pencils, and other necessities for repair and construction work, making it
easy to keep about 10 pounds of items on hand. The pockets are open, however,
and items can easily fall out if the belt is tipped.
