[Future D20 SRD]( / ) > Mutations




## Tail [MINOR]


You grow a thick tail. The tail may be fur-covered, slender and whiplike like a rat's, or scaly like a lizard's. Although the tail improves your balance and can serve as a weapon, it cannot be used for gripping objects.


MP Cost: 1.


Benefits: The tail provides a +2 mutation bonus on all Balance checks. In addition, you gain a single tail slam attack that deals bludgeoning damage dependent on your size: Small 1d4, Medium-size 1d6, Large 1d8. If you get multiple attacks in a round, you can strike multiple times with your tail. Your tail is treated as a natural weapon and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.


Special: A creature that already has a tail or the Prehensile Tail mutation cannot gain this mutation. This mutation can be used in conjunction with the Stinger mutation.
