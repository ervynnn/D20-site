## Inductor (PL 8)


Induction engine technology allows the robot to move about on a thin cushion of artificial gravity. The thrust does not enable the robot to corner quickly, but it can hover and float above liquid surfaces (including water).


Base Speed: 30 feet.


Purchase DC: One-half the base purchase DC of the robot's frame.
