## Mecha Sensor Systems


Sensor systems make it easier for mecha operators to perceive their surroundings; however, not all mecha are equipped with sensors (or even require them). In such cases, mecha operators must rely on their own acute vision and hearing.


A mecha equipped with sensors conducts passive scans of the surrounding area constantly, without the operator's attention. A passive scan extends in all directions at once, providing the operator with data on surrounding terrain, obstacles, and the location of other creatures, vehicles, and mecha within several miles of the mecha's position.


A sensor system can also be used to conduct an active scan of a single target. With a successful Computer Use check (DC 15) and a move action, a mecha's operator can use the onboard sensor system to actively scan a single nonliving target (usually another mecha or vehicle) and determine specific information about that target, as specified in the sensor system's description.


To build a sensor system from scratch, a character must succeed at a Craft (electrical) check (DC 30) after investing 60 hours in its assembly. A character without an electrical tool kit takes a '4 penalty on the skill check. The character must also make a Wealth check against the sensor system's purchase DC.


### Class I Sensor System (PL 6)


This sensor system includes air/space radar that allows a mecha operator to scan the basic topography of the surrounding area and pick out targets well enough to aim weapons at them. A Class I sensor system grants a +2 equipment bonus on the operator's Navigate and Spot checks.


With a successful Computer Use check (DC 15) and a move action, the operator can use the sensor system to actively scan a single nonliving target (usually another mecha or vehicle) and determine all the following information about that target:


- The target's size.
- The target's locomotive capabilities.
- The target's present direction or trajectory.



Equipment Slots: 1.
Activation: Move action (active scan mode only).
Range: 1-mile-radius emanation centered on your mecha.

Saving Throw: None.
Purchase DC: 18.
Restriction: None.


### Class II Sensor System (PL 6)


This sensor system includes an electromagnetic (EM) detector array that localizes electromagnetic emissions, and an infrared detector that tracks targets by their heat signatures. It also incorporates a high-resolution video system that differentiates targets by their visual profile. The hi-res video system incorporates a zoom feature, allowing close inspection of distant targets. A Class II sensor system grants a +2 equipment bonus on the operator's Navigate and Spot checks.


With a successful Computer Use check (DC 15) and a move action, the operator can use the sensor system to actively scan a single nonliving target (usually another mecha or vehicle) and determine all the following information about that target:


- The target's size.
- The target's locomotive capabilities.
- The target's present direction or trajectory.
- The number of living creatures aboard, if applicable.
- The composition of the target's hull or superstructure, as well as the type of its armor, if any.
- The target's weapon systems (functional and nonfunctional).



Equipment Slots: 1.
Activation: Move action (active scan mode only).
Range: 1-mile-radius emanation centered on your mecha.
Area: 1 nonliving target (active scan only).
Duration: Persistent (passive scan mode) or 1 round (active scan mode).
Saving Throw: None.
Purchase DC: 21.
Restriction: None.


### Class III Sensor System (PL 6)


This system combines the features of the Class II sensor system with an advanced night-vision unit.


The mecha operator gains darkvision to a range of 90 feet. A Class III sensor system also grants a +2 equipment bonus on the operator's Navigate and Spot checks.


With a successful Computer Use check (DC 15) and a move action, the operator can use the sensor system to actively scan a single nonliving target (usually another mecha or vehicle) and determine all the following information about that target:


- The target's size.

- The target's locomotive capabilities.
- The target's present direction or trajectory.
- The number of living creatures aboard, if applicable.
- The composition of the target's hull or superstructure, as well as the type of its armor, if any.
- The target's weapon systems (functional and nonfunctional).



Equipment Slots: 1.
Activation: Move action (active scan mode only).
Range: 1-mile-radius emanation centered on your mecha.
Area: 1 nonliving target (active scan only).
Duration: Persistent (passive scan mode) or 1 round (active scan mode).
Saving Throw: None.
Purchase DC: 25.
Restriction: Licensed (+1).


### Enigma Sensor Suite (PL 6)


Using a combination of thermal imaging, X-rays, and vibration sensors, the Enigma sensor suite enables the operator to effectively see through solid objects.
Fine details can't be detected, but a mecha using the Enigma suite could tell, for example, that three Medium-size humanoids were crouched behind a closed door, or that an escape tunnel runs from one building to another.


A mecha with the Enigma suite reduces the effects of concealment by two grades. Thus, an object with total concealment (50% miss chance) would have three-quarters concealment (30% miss chance) instead.



Equipment Slots: 1.
Activation: None.
Range: 150 feet.
Area: Cone-shaped emanation.
Duration: 1 round.
Saving Throw: None.
Purchase DC: 29.
Restriction: None.


### Oracle Targeting System (PL 6)


The standard computer-assisted targeting system for mecha combines holographic displays and heuristic target-prediction profiling to increase a mecha operator's accuracy. The system grants an enhancement bonus on attack rolls (+1 to +5) when using a specific ranged weapon selected by the operator. Switching the bonus from one weapon to another requires a move action.


The Oracle system has five different categories (denoted Mark I through Mark V). The purchase DC varies depending on the enhancement bonus conferred.



Equipment Slots: 1, must be helmet or visor.
Activation: Move action (to activate or switch).
Range: Personal.
Target: You.
Duration: Persistent.
Saving Throw: None.
Purchase DC: 16 for Mark I (+1), 18 for Mark II (+2), 20 for Mark III (+3), 22 for Mark IV (+4), 24 for Mark V (+5).
Restriction: None.


### Class IV Sensor System (PL 7)


This system includes electromagnetic (EM), infrared detector, hi-res video, and nightvision sensors similar to those found on the Class II and Class III systems. It also incorporates a ladar system that uses low-powered laser beams to quickly locate and identify difficult terrain, distant obstacles, and targets.
The mecha operator gains darkvision to a range of 120 feet. A Class IV sensor system also grants a +4 equipment bonus on the operator's Navigate and Spot checks.


With a successful Computer Use check (DC 15) and a move action, the operator can use the sensor system to actively scan a single nonliving target (usually another mecha or vehicle) and determine all the following information about that target:


- The target's size.
