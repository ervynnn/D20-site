## 
    Shadow Heritage [Initial]
   



    You have a creature of Shadow in your distant ancestry. The exact nature of that shadowblood is immaterial (though it may be a source of adventure), as the overpowering human genetic tide has reduced its special abilities to a few salient features.
   




     Benefit:
    
    You gain a +1 inherent bonus on one saving throw of your choice. You also gain low-light vision, which allows you to see twice as far as a normal human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. You retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
   




     Special:
    
    You may only take this feat as a 1st-level character.
