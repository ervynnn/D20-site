## 
     Novitiate
    



     Novitiates draw quiet strength from their belief in a greater power. They do not necessarily have ties to a specific religion or denominationtheir faith is enough. Some novitiates are lay clergy, counselors, motivational speakers, social workers, or any other position involved with helping people who have lost hope and faith.
