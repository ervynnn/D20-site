##  Quartz Compulsion

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting, Language-Dependent]

Skill Check: Knowledge (arcane lore) DC 33, 6 successes, and Intimidate DC 33,
2 successes; Failure: Two consecutive failed skill checks; Components: V, S,
F, B; Casting Time: 80 minutes (minimum); Range: Unlimited; Target: One
creature with fewer Hit Dice that you; Duration: 16 hours (see text); Saving
Throw: Will partial (DC 18 + caster’s Cha modifier); Spell Resistance: Yes

The quartz compulsion incantation lets you telepathically contact the subject
by gazing through a quartz shard, regardless of where the subject is located.
You can telepathically converse for 16 minutes with the subject. Your
telepathic contact can also contain a suggestion (as per the suggestion
psionic power), which the subject does her best to carry out. A successful
Will save negates the suggestion effect but not the contact itself. Telepathic
communcation is possible even if the creature’s Intelligence score is as low
as 1, but you must have a language in common with the subject to communicate.
If the message is impossible or meaningless according to the circumstances
that exist for the subject at the time the quartz compulsion comes, the
message is understood but the suggestion is ineffective.

Focus: A carefully cut shard of quartz (purchase DC 22).

Backlash: Caster is exhausted.

Failure: Reversal. You converse with the subject normally, but the suggestion
attempt automatically fails, and the subject can instead compel you (as per
the suggestion psionic power). You don’t get a saving throw, and spell
resistance does not apply. Depending on the specific suggestion, you may not
realize that your attempt failed or that you’ve been compelled.
