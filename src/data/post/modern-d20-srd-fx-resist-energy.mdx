## Resist Energy

Abjuration

[Level](modern-d20-srd-fx-level): [Acolyte](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-acolyte) 2, [Mage](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-mage) 2;
[Components](modern-d20-srd-fx-components): V, S, DF; [Casting Time](modern-d20-srd-fx-casting-time); [Attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) [Range](modern-d20-srd-fx-range): Touch;
[Target](modern-d20-srd-fx-target): Creature touched;
[Duration](modern-d20-srd-fx-duration): 10 minutes/level; [Saving Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): Fortitude negates (harmless);
[Spell Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance): Yes
(harmless)

This abjuration grants a creature limited protection to
[damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) from whichever one of five energy types
the caster selects: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic/concussion. The
creature gains [energy resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-resistance-to-energy) 10 against the energy type chosen, meaning that each
time the creature is subjected to such [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage)
(whether from a natural or magical source), that [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) is reduced by 10 points before being applied to the creature’s
[hit points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points). The value of the energy
resistance granted increases by 5 points for every three caster levels above
3rd. The spell protects the recipient’s equipment as well.

Resist energy absorbs only [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage). The
character could still suffer unfortunate side effects.
