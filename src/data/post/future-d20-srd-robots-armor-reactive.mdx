## Reactive Armor (PL 8)


Consisting of layers of insulating gel or compressed gas between cerametal sheets, reactive armor provides the same protection as crystal carbon armor but is considerably cheaper and easier to produce. Biodroid robots, bioreplica robots, and liquid-state robots cannot have integrated reactive armor.


Equipment Bonus: +8.


Weight: One-quarter the weight of the robot's frame (rounded down).


Speed Penalty: '5 feet.


Purchase DC: 5 + one-half the base purchase DC of the robot's frame.


Restriction: None.
