## Starship Operation


Select one of the following types of starships: ultralight, light, mediumweight, heavy, or superheavy. You are proficient at operating starships of that type.


Prerequisite: Pilot 2 ranks.


Benefit: When operating a starship of the selected type, you take no penalty on Pilot checks made when operating the starship, and you also apply your full class bonus to Defense to the ship's Defense.


Normal: Without this feat, you take a '4 nonproficient penalty on Pilot checks made to operate a starship, and you apply only one-half your class bonus to Defense (rounded down) to the ship's Defense.


Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a different type of starship (ultralight, light, mediumweight, heavy, or superheavy).
