## Starship Operation

Select one of the following types of starships: ultralight, light, mediumweight, heavy, or superheavy. You are proficient at operating starships of that type.

Prerequisite: Pilot 2 ranks.

Benefit: When operating a starship of the selected type, you take no penalty on Pilot checks made when operating the starship, and you also apply your full class bonus to Defense to the ships Defense.

Normal: Without this feat, you take a 4 nonproficient penalty on Pilot checks made to operate a starship, and you apply only one-half your class bonus to Defense (rounded down) to the ships Defense.

Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a different type of starship (ultralight, light, mediumweight, heavy, or superheavy).
