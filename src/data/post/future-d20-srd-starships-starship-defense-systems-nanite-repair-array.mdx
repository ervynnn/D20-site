## Nanite Repair Array (PL 8)


The final refinement of damage control systems, the nanite repair array consists of numerous nodules filled with nanitesmicroscopic robotsscattered throughout the ship. The nanite repair array can repair a ship with negative hit points; however, not even nanites can repair a destroyed ship.


Purchase DC: 10 + one-half the base purchase DC of the starship.


Restriction: Restricted (+2).
