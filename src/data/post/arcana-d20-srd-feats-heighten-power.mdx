##  Heighten Power [Metapsionic]

You can manifest a power as if it were a higher level than it actually is.

**Benefit:** A heightened power has a higher psionic power level than normal.
Unlike other metapsionic feats, Heighten Power actually increases the
effective level of the power that it modifies. All effects dependent on power
level (such as saving throw DCs) are calculated according to the heightened
level. The heightened power costs as many power points as a power of its
effective level.
