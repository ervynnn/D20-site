### Chrysanthemum Laser Array (PL 6)


A barrage of phosphorus lasers deals massive damage to the mecha’s surroundings, making this a weapon of last resort. Everything within 60 feet of the mecha (but not the mecha itself) takes 16d8 points of fire damage, after which the lasers burn themselves out. A successful Reflex save (DC 25) means the target takes only half damage.


Once fired, the Chrysanthemum burst array becomes nonfunctional and must be replaced.



Equipment Slots: 1.
Activation: Attack action.
Range: 0 feet.
Area: 60-foot-radius burst centered on you.
Duration: Instantaneous.
Saving Throw: Reflex half (DC 25).
Purchase DC: 26.
Restriction: Military (+3).



### M-300 Rhino Mass Cannon (PL 7)


The M-300 Rhino mass cannon charges a small bit of matter with incredible gravitational energy, then hurls it at the target, where its increased gravitational pull causes it to slam into the target like a wrecking ball. The weapon deals 8d12 points of ballistic damage on a successful hit.



Equipment Slots: 2, including hand (or arm if Large), arm, or shoulders.
Activation: Attack action.
Range Increment: 100 feet.
Target: Single target within 1,000 feet.
Duration: Instantaneous.
Saving Throw: None.
Purchase DC: 29.
Restriction: Military (+3).



### PS-25 Tiger Claws (PL 7)


An improvement over the PS-15 Panther claws, PS-25 Tiger claws have monofilament edges that shear through armor plating like knives through butter. They can be extended or retracted as a free action.


The claws convert the mecha’s slam attack into a claw attack that deals slashing damage. The amount of damage is based on the mecha’s size: Large 6d8, Huge 8d8, Gargantuan 10d8, and Colossal 12d8. The claws have a critical threat range of 19–20.


The claws are one size category smaller than the mecha’s size category.



Equipment Slots: 1, must be hand (or arm if Large).
Activation: Attack action.
Range: Touch.
Target: Single target within reach.
Duration: Instantaneous.
Saving Throw: None.
Purchase DC: 10 + one-quarter the mecha’s base purchase DC.
Restriction: None.



### Tsunami 480 Plasma Cannon (PL 7)


The Tsunami 280 plasma cannon has two aperture settings: focused beam and wide-angle beam. The mecha operator can switch between settings as a move action. The focused beam setting deals 12d6 points of fire damage with a successful ranged attack, and it has a critical threat range of 20. On the wide-angle setting, the weapon automatically hits everything within a 60-foot cone for 12d6 points of fire damage, but those in the area can make a Reflex save (DC 19) to reduce the damage by half. Critical hits aren’t possible on the wide-angle setting.



Equipment Slots: 3, including hand (or arm if Large), arm, shoulders, or visor.
Activation: Attack action.
Range Increment/Range: 150 feet (focused beam), or 60 feet (wide-angle).
Target/Area: Single target within 1,500 feet, or 60-foot cone.
Duration: Instantaneous.
Saving Throw: None or Reflex half (DC 19; see text).
Purchase DC: 25.
Restriction: Military (+3).



### XJ-A Python Electro-Whip (PL 7)


The XJ-A Python is an electrified cable with embedded servomotors that wrap around the target. The Python deals electricity damage according to the mecha’s size: Large 2d10, Huge 4d10, Gargantuan 6d10, and Colossal 8d10. The Python has an extra 15 feet of reach.


When using the Python, you get a +2 equipment bonus on your opposed attack roll when attempting to disarm an opponent (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if you fail to disarm your opponent).


Because the electro-whip can wrap around an enemy’s leg or other limb, you can make a trip attack with it by succeeding at a melee touch attack. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop or detach the Python electro-whip to avoid being tripped.


The electro-whip’s size category is the same as the mecha’s size category.



Equipment Slots: 1, must be hand (or arm if Large).
Activation: Attack action.
Range: Touch.
Target: Single target within reach.
Duration: Instantaneous.
Saving Throw: None.
Purchase DC: 10 + one-quarter the mecha’s base purchase DC.
Restriction: Restricted (+2).
