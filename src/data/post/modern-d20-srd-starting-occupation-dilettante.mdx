     Dilettante




     Dilettantes usually get their wealth from family holdings and trust funds. The typical dilettante has no job, few re­sponsibilities, and at least one driving passion that ­occupies his or her day. That passion might be a charity or philanthropic foundation, an ideal or cause worth fighting for, or a lust for living a fun and carefree existence.
