## Wall of Iron

Conjuration (Creation)

[Level](modern-d20-srd-fx-level): [Mage](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-mage) 5; [Components](modern-d20-srd-fx-components): V, S, M; [Casting Time](modern-d20-srd-fx-casting-time); [Attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) [Range](modern-d20-srd-fx-range): Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level); Effect: Iron wall whose area is up to one 5-ft. square/level (see text); [Duration](modern-d20-srd-fx-duration): Instantaneous; [Saving Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): See text; [Spell Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance): No

The caster causes a flat, vertical iron wall to spring into being. This wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. It must always be a flat plane, though the caster can shape its edges to fit the available space.

The wall of iron is 1 inch thick per four caster levels. The caster can double the wall’s area by halving its thickness. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 30 [hit points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points) per inch of thickness and hardness 10. A section of wall whose [hit points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points) drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll), the DC for the [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) check is 25 + 2 per inch of thickness.

If the caster desires, the wall can be created vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left unpushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly. A creature must succeed at a Strength check (DC 40) to push the wall over. Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful [Reflex saves](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws). Large and smaller creatures who fail take 10d6 points of [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage). The wall cannot crush Huge and larger creatures.

Like any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation, and other natural phenomena.

Material Component: Purchase DC 18.
