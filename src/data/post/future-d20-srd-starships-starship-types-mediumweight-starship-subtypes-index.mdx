## Mediumweight Starship Subtypes


Mediumweight starships encompass cruisers, clippers, and most transports. They balance firepower and defense with speed and maneuverability.


A mediumweight starship measures 501'1,000 feet long. It occupies a 1,000-foot-by-1,000-foot fighting space (4 500-foot squares). In addition, all mediumweight starships share the following design specs.


Engines: All mediumweight starships have thrusters plus one other type of engine (see Starship Engines).


Armor: A mediumweight starship has one type of armor (see Starship Armor).


Defensive Systems: A mediumweight starship has a maximum of one defensive system per 25 Hit Dice (see Starship Defense Systems).


Sensors: A mediumweight starship has a maximum of three sensor systems (see Starship Sensors).


Communications: A mediumweight starship has up to two external communication systems (see Starship Comm Systems).


Weapons: A mediumweight starship has one beam, projectile, or missile weapon per 25 Hit Dice (see Starship Weapons).


These weapons are often fire-linked or arrayed in batteries. A minelayer is considered a single weapon. Although it weighs no more than a few thousand pounds, each mine consumes 100 tons of a ship's cargo capacity (most of it taken up by the launch system and radiation shielding).


Grappling Systems: A mediumweight starship may have up to two grappling systems (see Grappling Systems). Each grappling system takes away one of the ship's weapon slots (see above).
