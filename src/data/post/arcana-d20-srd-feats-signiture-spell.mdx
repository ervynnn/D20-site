## Signature Spell

You are so familiar with a mastered spell that you can spontaneously cast it, converting other prepared spells into that spell.

Prerequisite: Spell Mastery ability.

Benefit: Each time you take this feat, choose a spell that you have mastered with Spell Mastery. You may now convert prepared arcane spells of that spells level or higher into this signature spell, just as an Acolyte of good allegiance may spontaneously cast prepared spells as cure spells.

Special: You may gain this feat multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new spell that meets the prerequisites.
