## Acid


Corrosive acids deal [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) each round of exposure. The amount of [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) varies depending on the acids strength, as noted on Table: Acid [Damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage).


| Table: Acid [Damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) |  |  |
| :---------------------------------------------------- | :--: | --: |
|  |  |  |
| Mild | 1d6 | 1d10 |
| Potent | 2d6 | 2d10 |
| Concentrated | 3d6 | 3d10 |
| *[Damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) per round of exposure. |  |  |



Acid [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) from an attack reduces [hit
  points](modern-d20-srd-combat-hit-points). A character fully immersed in acid takes potentially more [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) per round of exposure than a character splashed with acid.


The fumes from most acids are inhaled poisons. Those who come within 5 feet of a large body of acid must make a [Fortitude
  save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) (DC 15) or take 1 point of temporary [Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage). A second [save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) must succeed 1 minute later to avoid taking another 1d4 points of [Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) [damage](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores).
