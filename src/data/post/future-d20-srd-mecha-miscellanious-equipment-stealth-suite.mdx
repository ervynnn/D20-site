## Stealth Suite (PL 6)


Based on high-tech low observables technology, this combination of sound baffles, heat dispersers, and nonreflective paint combines to give the mecha a +10 bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks. Cost and the size penalty combine to make this structural option impractical on all but the smallest mecha.
