### Class Features

The following class features pertain to the Dreadnought advanced class.

Fearless
The Dreadnought is immune to fear effects.

Stability
The Dreadnought is incredibly sure-footed. She gains a +4 stability bonus on all rolls made to resist being tripped, overrun, knocked prone, or pushed back by a bull rush attack.

Unhindered
The Dreadnought treats any suit of armor worn as though its armor penalty is 2 better.
Ability Surge

At 2nd level, the Dreadnought can temporarily increase her Strength, but at a penalty to Defense. At 5th and 8th level, she can use this ability more frequently.

The Dreadnought gains a +8 morale bonus to Strength, but takes a 2 penalty to Defense. Activating ability surge is a free action, and the surge lasts for a number of rounds equal to the Dreadnoughts class level. Following the ability surge, the
Dreadnought is fatigued for as many rounds as she surged, but may negate this penalty as a free action by spending an action point. The Dreadnought may use the ability surge once per day at 2nd level, twice per day at 5th level, and three times per day at 8th level.

Steamroller
Starting at 2nd level, the Dreadnought does not need to move before making an overrun attempt against an opponent. She also gains a +2 bonus on any trip attack made against an opponent who blocks her overrun attempt.

Bonus Feats
At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Dreadnought gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Dreadnought must meet all the prerequisites of the feat to select it.

Action Boost, Advanced Combat Martial Arts, Advanced Firearms Proficiency, Advanced Two-Weapon Fighting, Armor Proficiency (light), Armor Proficiency (medium), Armor Proficiency (heavy), Armor Proficiency (powered), Athletic, Brawl, Burst Fire, Cleave, Combat Expertise, Combat Martial Arts, Combat Reflexes, Endurance, Frightful Presence, Great Cleave, Improved Brawl, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Combat Martial Arts, Improved Combat Throw, Improved Disarm, Improved Knockout Punch, Improved Trip, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Knockout Punch, Mobility, Power Attack, Run, Spring Attack, Strafe, Streetfighting, Sunder, Toughness, Two-Weapon Fighting, Ultra Immune System.

Master Defender
Starting at 4th level, the Dreadnought becomes especially skilled in defensive fighting. Whenever she fights defensively or takes the total defense action, she gains a +2 bonus to Defense (in addition to the dodge bonus to Defense gained while fighting defensively or engaged in total defense).

The Dreadnought must be wearing medium, heavy, or powered armor to gain this bonus.

The bonus increases to +4 at 7th level and +6 and 10th level.

Knockdown
At 5th level and beyond, whenever the Dreadnought is allowed to apply her Strength modifier to damage, she forces the target of her successful attack to make at a Fortitude save (DC = damage dealt) or be knocked prone by the force of the blow.

Heavy Artillery
Beginning at 8th level, a Dreadnought treats all weapons as one size category smaller for purposes of determining whether or not she can wield them in one hand and if they are considered light weapons.
