## Craft Cybernetics


You can construct cybernetic attachments.


Prerequisites: Craft (electrical) 10 ranks, Craft (mechanical) 10 ranks, Knowledge (life sciences) 5 ranks.


Benefits: You can build cybernetic attachments. You must first make a Wealth check against the purchase DC of the attachment (to acquire the necessary components), then invest 24 hours in its construction. At the end of that time, you must succeed at a Craft (mechanical) check (DC 30) and a Craft (electrical) check (DC 30).


If both Craft checks succeed, the cybernetic attachment functions properly and can be installed at any time (see the Cybernetic Surgery feat). If either or both checks fail, the attachment's design is flawed; another 24 hours must be spent fixing the problems, and two new checks must be made at the end of that time.


Special: This feat does not allow you to build a cybernetic attachment of a higher Progress Level.
