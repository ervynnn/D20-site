### Class Features


The following class features pertain to the Engineer advanced class.


Builder
At 1st level, the Engineer gains the bonus feat Builder.


Improve Kit (+1)
An engineer can use his know-how to upgrade an electrical or mechanical tool kit at no additional cost.


Electrical Tool Kit, Basic: For the cost of a basic electrical tool kit, an Engineer can assemble a mastercraft (+1) version of the kit that grants a +1 equipment bonus on all Repair checks made to fix electrical devices.


Electrical Tool Kit, Deluxe: For the cost of a deluxe electrical tool k it, an Engineer can assemble a mastercraft (+1) version that grants a +3 equipment bonus (instead of the usual +2 equipment bonus) on all Repair checks made to fix electrical devices and a +1 equipment bonus on all Craft (electrical) checks.


Mechanical Tool Kit, Basic: For the cost of a basic mechanical tool kit, an Engineer can assemble a mastercraft (+1) version of the kit that grants a +1 equipment bonus on all Repair checks made to fix mechanical devices.


Mechanical Tool Kit, Deluxe: For the cost of a deluxe mechanical kit, an Engineer can assemble a mastercraft (+1) version that grants a +3 equipment bonus (instead of the usual +2 equipment bonus) on all Repair checks made to fix mechanical devices and a +1 equipment bonus on all Craft (mechanical) and Craft (structural) checks.


Quick Craft
At 2nd level, an engineer learns how to craft ordinary scratch-built electronic, mechanical, and structural objects more quickly than normal.


When using the Craft (electronic), Craft (mechanical), or Craft (structural) skill to build an ordinary scratch-built item, the Engineer reduces the building time by one-quarter.


At 5th level, the Engineer reduces the building time of ordinary objects and mastercraft objects by half.


Superior Repair
At 2nd level, an Engineer learns improved ways of repairing robots, vehicles, mecha, starships, and cybernetic attachments.


An Engineer with a mechanical tool kit and an appropriate facility (a workshop, garage, or hangar) can repair damage to a robot, vehicle, mecha, starship, or cybernetic attachment. (Without a mechanical tool kit, the Engineer takes a '4 penalty on the Repair check.) With 1 hour of work, the engineer can restore a number of hit points based on his Repair check result, as shown in Table: Superior Repair. If damage remains, the Engineer may continue to make repairs for as many hours as needed to fully repair the damaged robot, vehicle, mecha, starship, or cybernetic attachment.


| Table: Superior Repair |  |
| :------------------------ | --: |
|  |  |
| Less than 20 | None |
| 20'29 | 2d6 + Engineer class level |
| 30'39 | 3d6 + Engineer class level |
| 40+ | 4d6 + Engineer class level |



Bonus Feats
At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Engineer gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Engineer must meet all the prerequisites of the feat to select it.


Aircraft Operation (spacecraft), Builder, Cautious, Gearhead, Mastercrafter, Salvage, Surface Vehicle Operation, Vehicle Expert, Zero-G Training.


Improve Kit (+2)
At 4th level, the Engineer can assemble mastercraft (+2) electrical and mechanical tool kits. This ability works as the 1st-level improve kit class feature, except the equipment bonuses improve by an additional +1.


Reconfigure Weapon
At 4th level, an Engineer can reconfigure a melee or ranged weapon, improving one aspect of it. Reconfiguring a weapon requires 1 hour of work and a successful Repair check (DC 20); reconfiguring a mastercraft weapon is slightly harder (DC 20 + the weapon's mastercraft bonus feature). An Engineer may take 10 or take 20 on this check.


The reconfiguration imposes a '1 penalty on attack rolls made with the weapon but grants one of the following benefits
indefinitely:


Changed Rate of Fire: The reconfiguration changes the weapon's rate of fire. A semiautomatic-only weapon switches to an automatic-only weapon, or vice versa. This benefit applies only to a ranged weapon with either a semiautomatic or automatic fire setting.


Greater Ammo Capacity: The reconfigured weapon can hold 50% more ammunition than normal. This benefit applies only to weapons that take ammunition.


Greater Concealment: The reconfiguration grants a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal the reconfigured weapon.


Greater Range Increment: The reconfigured weapon's range increment increases by 10 feet. This benefit applies only to weapons with range increments.


Signature Shooter: The weapon is reconfigured for a single individual's use only and is treated as a unique exotic weapon. Anyone else who uses the weapon takes a '4 nonproficient penalty on attack rolls.


Weapons can be reconfigured multiple times; each time a weapon is reconfigured, it imparts a new benefit. Undoing an Engineer's weapon reconfiguration requires 1 hour and a successful Disable Device check (DC 20 + the Engineer's class level).


Sabotage
At 4th level and beyond, the Engineer can sabotage an electrical or mechanical object so that it operates poorly. The Engineer must succeed on a Disable Device check (DC 20) to accomplish the downgrade, and sabotaging a mastercraft object is slightly harder (DC 20 + the mastercraft object's bonus feature). Noticing the Engineer's handiwork without first testing the sabotaged device requires a successful Search check (DC = the Engineer's Disable Device check result). Fixing the sabotaged item requires a successful Repair.


Sabotage Device: As a full-round action, the Engineer can reconfigure a device with electrical or mechanical components so that anyone who uses it suffers a penalty equal to the Engineer's class level on skill checks made to use the device.


Sabotage Weapon: As a full-round action, the Engineer can sabotage a weapon so that it misfires or breaks the next time it is used. A sabotaged weapon cannot be used effectively until repaired. This use of sabotage also applies to vehicle and starship weapons.


Craft XP Reserve
Starting at 5th level, an Engineer with the Mastercrafter feat can build mastercraft electronic and mechanical devices without investing as much of himself in the process.


At 5th level and every level thereafter, an Engineer gains a special reserve of experience points equal to 100 Ã— his
Engineer class level. These extra experience points are separate from experience gained through level advancement and can only be used to make mastercraft items; they do not count toward level gain.


An Engineer must spend the extra experience points he gains at each level, for when the Engineer gains a level, he loses any unspent experience points in his reserve.


Improve Kit (+3)
At 7th level, the Engineer can assemble mastercraft (+3) electrical and mechanical tool kits. This ability works as the 4th-level improve kit class feature, except the equipment bonuses improve by an additional +1.


Quick Fix
At 7th level, the Engineer can repair a mechanical or electrical device in half the normal time; see the Repair skill description for normal repair times. However, cutting the repair time increases the Repair check DC by 5.


Weapon Upgrade
At 8th level, an Engineer can upgrade handheld or robot-installed weapons, as well as weapon systems aboard vehicles, mecha, or starships.


| Table: Weapon Upgrade |  |
| :----------------------- | --: |
|  |  |
| Weapon also dazes target for 1 round | 25 |
| Weapon also knocks target prone | 30 |
| Weapon leaves target shaken for 1d4 rounds | 35 |
| Weapon also stuns target for 1d4 rounds | 40 |
|  |  |
| Weapon deals an extra two dice of damage | 25 |
| Weapon ignores 5 points of target's hardness/DR | 30 |
| Weapon's critical hit multiplier increases by 1 | 35 |
| Weapon ignores 10 points of target's hardness/DR | 40 |



The Engineer must spend 1 hour tinkering with the weapon, after which he must succeed at a Craft (mechanical) check. The DC varies depending on how the weapon is modified, as shown in Table: Weapon Upgrade. If the skill check fails, the attempt to modify the weapon also fails, although the Engineer may try again. (The engineer may take 20 on the skill check, but the upgrade takes 20 hours to complete.) An upgraded weapon has a 10% chance of breaking after each time it is used; it cannot be used again until repaired, and repairing it requires 1 hour and a successful Repair check (DC 40).


Unflustered
A 10th-level Engineer can perform complicated tasks without provoking attacks of opportunity from adjacent foes.
During any round in which the Engineer uses the Computer Use, Craft, Demolitions, Disable Device, or Repair skill, he can first make a Concentration check (DC 15) to use the desired skill without provoking attacks of opportunity. Making the Concentration check doesn't cost the Engineer an action. He may take 10 on the Concentration check, but he cannot take 20.
