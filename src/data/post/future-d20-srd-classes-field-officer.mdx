### Class Features

The following class features pertain to the Field Officer advanced class.

Leadership
By providing supervision and guidance, a Field Officer can improve an allys chances of succeeding at a skill check. Instead of making a skill check to aid another, the Field Officer makes a Diplomacy check (DC 10). He cannot take 10 or take 20 on the check. Success grants a competence bonus on the allys skill check equal to the Field Officers Charisma bonus or Reputation bonus, whichever is greater. The ally must be within sight and hearing distance of the Field Officer and must be able to understand him.

A Field Officer cannot use this ability on himself.

Uncanny Survival
Beginning at 2nd level, a Field Officer can add one-half his class level to his Defense for 1 round, once per day. (The bonus applies to the Field Officers touch and flat-footed Defense, as well.) He must declare he is doing this at the beginning of his turn, and the Defense bonus lasts until his next round of actions.

Bonus Feats
At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Field Officer gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Field Officer must meet all the prerequisites of the feat to select it.

Advanced Firearms Proficiency, Armor Proficiency (light), Armor Proficiency (medium), Armor Proficiency (heavy), Armor Proficiency (powered), Combat Expertise, Dodge, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Mobility, Precise Shot, Quick Draw, Renown, Shot on the Run.

Tactical Expertise
Starting at 4th level, as a full-round action, a Field Officer can use his tactical knowledge to coordinate allies. Allies to be affected must be within sight and hearing distance of the Field Officer and must be able to understand him.

The Field Officer must make a Knowledge (tactics) check with a DC equal to 15 + the number of allies affected. He cannot take 10 or take 20 on the check. If the check succeeds, all affected allies gain a competence bonus on attack rolls or a dodge bonus to Defense equal to the Field Officers Reputation bonus. The Field Officer chooses which of the two benefits to impart and must impart the same benefit to all affected allies. The benefits last for 1 round.

If the check fails, the Field Officers allies gain no benefit, but the action is still spent.

A Field Officer cannot apply the benefits of this ability to himself.

August Leadership
The Field Officer gains this ability at 5th level. It works like the leadership ability (see above), except the Field Officer adds his Charisma bonus and his Reputation bonus to the allys skill check.

Tactical Mastery
At 7th level, the Field Officer requires less time to direct his allies. This ability is similar to tactical expertise (see Tactical Expertise, above) but requires an attack action instead of a full-round action.

Commanding Presence
At 8th level and beyond, a Field Officer can use an attack action and his commanding presence to enable an ally or weaken a single foes resolve.

Enabling an ally requires an attack action and a successful Diplomacy check (DC 20). If the check succeeds, the Field Officer can negate any one of the following harmful conditions affecting a single ally: cowering, dazed, fatigued, nauseated, panicked, shaken, or stunned. The ally to be affected must be within sight and hearing distance of the Field Officer and must be able to understand him.

The Field Officer cannot use this ability on himself.

Weakening a foes resolve requires an attack action and a successful Intimidate check (DC = targets level check) . If the check succeeds, the target is shaken for a number of rounds equal to 1d6 + one-half the Field Officers class level + the Field Officers Charisma modifier. The target must be within sight and hearing distance of the Field Officer and must be able to understand him. A target that resists the Field Officers attempt to weaken its resolve is immune to the Field Officers use of this ability for 24 hours.

Action Trust
At 10th level, the Field Officers mere presence inspires, safeguards, and motivates his allies.

As a free action, a Field Officer may spend one of his action points to modify an allys attack roll, skill check, ability check, level check, or saving throw result by +2d6 (applying a bonus of +2 to +12).

The ally to be affected must be within sight and hearing distance of the Field Officer to gain the benefits of the Field Officers spent action point. A Field Officer may use this ability once per round, and not on himself (he gains the normal benefits for spending an action point on himself).

Any character may transfer some or all of her action points to the Field Officer as a free action. The Field Officer must consent to the transfer, and these action points become the Field Officers to spend as he sees fit.
