## 
     Autopilot System (PL 5)
    



     An autopilot system “kicks in” whenever the pilot is unable to fly the starship. An autopilot system isn’t as good at avoiding attacks as a living pilot, but it’s better than nothing. Larger vessels have more adaptive autopilot systems than smaller ships (although this increased sophistication doesn’t outweigh the penalties associated with the ships’ larger sizes).
    



     An autopilot system provides an equipment bonus to the starship’s Defense depending on the ship’s size: Huge +1, Gargantuan +2, Colossal +4. This bonus applies only when the autopilot system is engaged.
    



     Purchase DC: 5 + one-quarter the base purchase DC of the starship.
    



     Restriction: None.
