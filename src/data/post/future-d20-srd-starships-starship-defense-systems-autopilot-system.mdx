## 
     Autopilot System (PL 5)
    



     An autopilot system kicks in whenever the pilot is unable to fly the starship. An autopilot system isnt as good at avoiding attacks as a living pilot, but its better than nothing. Larger vessels have more adaptive autopilot systems than smaller ships (although this increased sophistication doesnt outweigh the penalties associated with the ships larger sizes).
    



     An autopilot system provides an equipment bonus to the starships Defense depending on the ships size: Huge +1, Gargantuan +2, Colossal +4. This bonus applies only when the autopilot system is engaged.
    



     Purchase DC: 5 + one-quarter the base purchase DC of the starship.
    



     Restriction: None.
