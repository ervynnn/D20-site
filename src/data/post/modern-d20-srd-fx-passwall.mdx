## Passwall

Transmutation

[Level](modern-d20-srd-fx-level): [Mage](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-mage) 5; [Components](modern-d20-srd-fx-components): V, S, M; [Casting Time](modern-d20-srd-fx-casting-time); [Attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) [Range](modern-d20-srd-fx-range): Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels); Effect: 5-ft.-by-8 ft. opening, 1 ft./level deep; [Duration](modern-d20-srd-fx-duration): 1 hour/level (D); [Saving Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): None; [Spell Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance): No

The caster creates a passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not through metal or other harder materials. If the walls thickness is more than 1 foot per caster level, then a single passwall simply makes a niche or short tunnel. Several passwall spells can then form a continuing passage to breach very thick walls. When passwall ends, creatures within the passage are ejected out the nearest exit. If someone [dispels](modern-d20-srd-fx-dispel-magic) the passwall or the caster dismisses it, creatures in the passage are ejected out the far exit if there is one or out the sole exit if there is only one.
