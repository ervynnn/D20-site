## Genetic Manipulation


Genetic manipulation becomes possible at PL 5 when technology advances enough to create electron microscopes, computer-aided imagery, and the tools to delicately examine and manipulate the tiniest building blocks of lifeâ€”genes. At this point, scientists are able to experiment with DNA, gene splicing, and other activities that eventually lead to more advanced techniques.
