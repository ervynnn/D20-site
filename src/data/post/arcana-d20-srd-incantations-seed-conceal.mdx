##  Seed: Conceal

Illusion

Knowledge (arcane lore) DC: 30; Range: Personal or touch; Target: You or a
creature or object up to 2,000 lb.; Duration: Minutes; Saving Throw: None or
Will negates (harmless, object); Spell Resistance: No or Yes (harmless,
object)

You can conceal a creature or object touched from sight, even from darkvision.
If the target is a creature carrying gear, the gear vanishes, too, rendering
the creature invisible, with all the rules that apply to invisibility. An
incantation using the conceal seed ends if the subject attacks any creature.
Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the incantation, and
causing harm indirectly is not an attack. To create invisibility that lasts
regardless of the actions of the subject, increase the Knowledge (arcane lore)
check DC by +4.

Alternatively, you can conceal the exact location of the subject so that it
appears to be about 2 feet away from its true location; this increases the
Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by +2. The subject benefits from a 50% miss
chance as if it had full concealment. However, unlike actual full concealment,
this displacement effect does not prevent enemies from targeting him normally.

The conceal seed can also be used to block out divinatory spells such as
scrying spells, spell-like effects, and incantations developed using the
reveal seed; this increases the Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by +6. In all
cases where incantations are used against the subject of a incantation using
the conceal seed for this purpose, an opposed Knowledge (arcane lore) check
determines which incantation works.
