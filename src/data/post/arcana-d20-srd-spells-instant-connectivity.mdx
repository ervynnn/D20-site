## 
    Instant Connectivity
   



    Conjuration (Teleporting)
   



    Level: Arcane 5; Components: V, S, F; Casting Time: Attack action; Range: Touch (see text); Target: Creature touched, or up to eight willing creatures joining hands; Duration: Instantaneous; Saving Throw: Will negates; Spell Resistance: Yes
   



    Instant connectivity can only be cast through a computer network (see the Casting Spells through Email sidebar). With the aid of instant messaging software, you physically transport the subject or subjects from one place to another. If several willing persons link hands in a circle, up to eight creatures can be affected by the spell at the same time.
   



    At least one of the creatures affected must be touching a computer with an Internet connection and active instant messaging (IM) software. The targets must be sent to a specific IM address that is currently active online. Instant connectivity causes the targets to appear in the room from which that IM address is being accessed, automatically gaining surprise on anyone else in that room.
   



    Focus: A computer hard drive (purchase DC 23 or higher).
