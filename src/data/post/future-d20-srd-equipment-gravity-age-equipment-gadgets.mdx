## Gravity Age Equipment Gadgets
   



    The following gadgets are found in the Gravity Age and can apply to equipment of that era or later, provided all gadget-specific restrictions are observed.
   


### Hud Software, Ammunition Tracker
   



    A piece of software for the heads-up display device, the Ammunition Tracker is able to keep track of exactly how many shots have been expended from a particular weapon. Additionally, when a character starts to get low on ammunition, a warning flashes on the HUD indicating that a reload must occur soon.
   




     Restrictions
    
    : Heads-up display only, requires a weapon with an integrated computer.
    
     Purchase DC Modifier
    
    : +1.
   


### Sound Suppressor
   



    Similar to the technology that produced the silent suit, the sound suppressor gadget silences almost any noise. It generates a field of sonic energy that cancels sound produced within field, reducing all noise to a mere whine of sonic energy discharge. The sound suppressor adds +10 to the DC of Listen checks made to hear the weapon firing.
   




     Restrictions
    
    : None.
    
     Purchase DC Modifier
    
    : +3.
