     Wererat (Template)




     Wererats retain whatever languages they spoke before they contracted lycanthropy. They are generally 5 to 6 feet tall and weigh 125 to 150 pounds.




     Template Traits




     Wererat is a template (usually acquired by contracting lycanthropy, but very occasionally inherited when two wererats mate) that can be added to any humanoid creature (referred to hereafter as the character). A wererat uses the characters statistics and special qualities in addition to those described below.




     Challenge Rating: Same as the character +2.




     Hit Dice: Same as the character plus the dire rats base Hit Dice (1d8).




     Speed: Same as the character while in humanoid form. In hybrid or rat form, speed becomes 40 ft., climb 20 ft.




     Defense: Same as the character while in humanoid form. In hybrid and animal form, the creature gains a +1 natural armor bonus to Defense. This bonus does not stack with other natural armor bonuses.




     Base Attack: Same as the character.




     Grapple Bonus: Apply modifiers for Strength and size depending on the lycanthropes form.




     Attacks: Same as the character while in humanoid form. In hybrid and rat form, a wererat attacks with its bite, dealing 1d4 points of damage plus its Strength modifier.




     Special Qualities: A wererat retains all the special qualities of the character and gains the additional special qualities listed below.




     Alternate Form (Su): A wererat can assume rat or hybrid form, but its gear is not absorbed into the new form. The bipedal hybrid form is about 5 feet tall, with a long tail and thin fur. The limbs are human, but the head looks like a rats. Changing to or from rat or hybrid form is a move action. Upon assuming either form, the wererat regains hit points as if having rested for a day. A slain wereat reverts to its humanoid form, although it remains dead. Afflicted wererats find this ability difficult to control. The rare natural wererat has full control over this power.




     Curse of Lycanthropy (Su): Any humanoid bitten by a wererats bite attack (in rat or hybrid form) must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 15) or contract lycanthropy.




     Damage Reduction 15/Silver (Su): A wererat in rat or hybrid form ignores the first 15 points of damage dealt by a nonsilver or nonmagical weapon but takes full damage from silvered weapons or weapons with +1 or better magic bonus.




     Scent (Ex): This ability allows a wererat in rat or hybrid form to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Rat Empathy (Ex): A wererat can communciate with rats in any form and gains a +4 species bonus on Diplomacy checks when influencing a rats attitude. A friendly rat understands and heeds simple commands, such wait, watch, flee, and attack.

     Darkvision (Ex): In their rat and hybrid forms, wererats have darkvision with a range of 60 feet.




     Allegiances: An afflicted wereat gains the law and evil allegiances (displacing other allegiances, if need be). They also generally gain an allegiance to other wererats, although this need not be the primary allegiance. The allegiances to law and evil can be removed only when the wererat has the ability to control the curse of lycanthropy by taking 10 on a Control Shape check.




     Saves: Same as the character, with a +2 species bonus on Fortitude and Reflex saves.




     Ability Scores: Wererats gain the following ability score increases: Dex +6, Con +2. In addition, they gain the following ability score increase in hybrid form: Str +2.




     Skill Bonuses: Same as the character, with a +4 species bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks when in humanoid form. In rat or hybrid form, these bonuses

increase to +8. A wererat in rat form also gains 3 ranks in Climb, 4 ranks in Hide, and 3 ranks in Move Silently.

     Bonus Feats: Same as the character. A wererat gains the bonus feat Weapon Finesse (any one eligible weapon) in humanoid form and the bonus feat Weapon Finesse (bite) in rat or hybrid form.
