##  Using FX Items

To use a magic item or psionic item, it must be activated. The three ways to
activate FX items are described below.

Command Word: If no activation method is suggested either in the item
description or by the nature of the item, assume that a command word is needed
to activate it. Command word activation means that a character speaks the word
and the item activates. No other special knowledge is needed.

The [ Knowledge ](modern-d20-srd-skills-knowledge) (arcane lore) skill might
be useful in identifying secret command words or deciphering clues regarding
them. A successful [ check ](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 30) is needed to come up with the word itself. If that [check ](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) is failed,
succeeding at a second [ check ](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 25) might provide some insight or clue to discovering the
command word or phrase.

Activating a command word FX item is an [ attack action ](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) and does not provoke [ attacks of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity) .

FX Completion: This is the activation method for [ scrolls ](modern-d20-srd-fx-items-scrolls) . To use an FX completion item safely, a character must be
high enough level in the right class to cast the spell already.

Activating an FX completion item is an [ attack action ](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) and provokes attacks of [ opportunity ](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity) .

Use Activated: This type of item is activated simply by use. Use activation is
generally straightforward and self-explanatory.

Many use-activated items are objects that a character wears. Continually
functioning items are practically always items that one wears. A few must
simply be in the character’s possession. However, some items made for wearing
must still be activated. Although this activation sometimes requires a command
word (see above), usually it means mentally willing the activation to happen.
The description of an item states whether a command word is needed.

Unless stated otherwise, activating a use-activated FX item is either an [attack action ](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) or a [ free action](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types) and does not provoke [ attacks of opportunity ](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity) , unless the use
involves committing an action that provokes an [ attack of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity) in itself. If the use of the
item takes time before an effect occurs, then use activation is an [ attack action ](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) . If the item’s activation is
subsumed in use and takes no extra time, use activation is a [ free action](modern-d20-srd-combat-action-types) .

Use activation doesn’t mean that if a character uses an item, he or she
automatically knows what it can do. A character must know (or at least guess)
what the item can do and then use the item to activate it, unless the benefit
of the item comes automatically.
