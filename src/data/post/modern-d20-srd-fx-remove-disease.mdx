Remove [ disease ](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-disease) cures all
treatable [ diseases ](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-disease) afflicting
the subject. It does not rid the subject of a [ disease ](modern-d20-srd-environment-hazards-disease) for which no cure exists. Since the spellâ€™s
duration is instantaneous, it does not prevent reinfection after a new
exposure to the same disease at a later date.
