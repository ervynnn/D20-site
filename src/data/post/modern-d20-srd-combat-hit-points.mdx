## Hit Points


A characters hit points tell how much punishment he or she can take before dropping. Hit points are based on the characters class and level, and the characters [Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) modifier applies.


When a characters hit point total drops to 0, he or she is disabled. When it drops to 1, he or she is dying. When it drops to 10, the character is dead.
