    Improved Trip




    Prerequisites:
    [Intelligence](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores)
    13,
    [Combat  Expertise](modern-d20-srd-feats-combat-expertise)
.

    Benefit: The character does not provoke an
    [attack  of opportunity](modern-d20-srd-combat-attacks-of-opportunity)
when the character tries to
[trip](modern-d20-srd-combat-trip)
an opponent while the character is unarmed.

    If the character
    [trips](modern-d20-srd-combat-trip)
    an opponent in melee combat, the character immediately gets to make a melee
    [attack](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll)
    against that opponent as if the character had not used his or her
    [attack  action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions)
for the
[trip](modern-d20-srd-combat-trip)
attempt.
