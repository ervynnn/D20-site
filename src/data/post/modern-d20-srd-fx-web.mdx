## Web


Conjuration (Creation)


[Level](modern-d20-srd-fx-level): [Mage](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-mage) 2; [Components](modern-d20-srd-fx-components): V, S, M; [Casting Time](modern-d20-srd-fx-casting-time); [Attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) [Range](modern-d20-srd-fx-range): Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level); Effect: Webs in a 20-ft.-radius spread; [Duration](modern-d20-srd-fx-duration):  10 minutes/_level; [Saving Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): Reflex negates (see text); [Spell Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance): Yes


The web spell creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands. These strands trap those caught in them.  These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed pointsfloor and ceiling, opposite walls, and so forthor else the web collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures caught within a web or simply touching its strands become entangled among the gluey fibers.



An entangled creature takes a 2 penalty on [attack
rolls](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-roll), takes a 4 penalty to effective [Dexterity](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores), and cant move. An entangled character who attempts to cast a spell must make a [Concentration](modern-d20-srd-skills-concentration) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 15) or lose the spell.




Anyone in the effects area when the spell is cast must make a [Reflex
save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws). If this [save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) succeeds, the creature is not stuck in the webs and is free to act, though moving is slow and may cause it to become stuck (see below). If the [save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) fails, the creature is stuck. A stuck creature can break loose by spending 1 round and succeeding on a [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) check (DC 20) or an [Escape
Artist](modern-d20-srd-skills-escape-artist) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index) (DC 25). Once loose (either by making the initial [Reflex
save](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws) or a later [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) check or [Escape
Artist](modern-d20-srd-skills-escape-artist) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index)), a creature may progress through the web very slowly. Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new [Strength](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) check or [Escape
Artist](modern-d20-srd-skills-escape-artist) [check](modern-d20-srd-skills-skill-basics-php#skill-check-index). The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10.




The web provides one-quarter [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover) for every 5 feet of the substance between the character and an opponentone-half [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover) for 10 feet of web, three-quarters for 15 feet, and total [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover) for 20 feet or more.




The strands of a web spell are flammable. Any fire can set them alight and burn away 5 square feet in 1 round. All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage) from the flames.
