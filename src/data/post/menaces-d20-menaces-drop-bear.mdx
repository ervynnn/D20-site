##  Drop Bear

The minor differences between a drop bear and a koala are discernable only to
trained naturalists. A drop bear can even imitate the sleepy demeanor of its
genetic cousins as a sort of behavioral camouflage. Because drop bears can so
easily be mistaken for koalas, roughly one-third of all fatalities from drop
bear attacks occur when well-meaning tourists try to pose with the creatures
for souvenir photographs.

###  Species Traits

Scent (Ex): This ability allows a drop bear to detect approaching enemies,
sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Stealthy Pounce (Ex): If a drop bear leaps upon a flat-footed foe, it can make
a full attack even if it has already taken a move action.
