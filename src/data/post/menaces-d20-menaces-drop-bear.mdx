## 
     Drop Bear
    



     The minor differences between a drop bear and a koala are discernable only to trained naturalists. A drop bear can even imitate the sleepy demeanor of its genetic cousins as a sort of behavioral camouflage. Because drop bears can so easily be mistaken for koalas, roughly one-third of all fatalities from drop bear attacks occur when well-meaning tourists try to pose with the creatures for souvenir photographs.
    


### 
     Species Traits
    



     Scent (Ex): This ability allows a drop bear to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.
    



     Stealthy Pounce (Ex): If a drop bear leaps upon a flat-footed foe, it can make a full attack even if it has already taken a move action.
