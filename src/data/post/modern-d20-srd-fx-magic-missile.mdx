## Magic Missile

Evocation [Force]

[Level](modern-d20-srd-fx-level): [Mage](modern-d20-srd-classes-advanced-mage) 1; [Components](modern-d20-srd-fx-components): V, S; [Casting Time](modern-d20-srd-fx-casting-time); [Attack action](modern-d20-srd-combat-attack-actions) [Range](modern-d20-srd-fx-range): Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level); [Targets](modern-d20-srd-fx-target): Up to five creatures, no two of which can be more than 15 ft. apart; [Duration](modern-d20-srd-fx-duration): Instantaneous; [Saving Throw](modern-d20-srd-basics-saving-throws): None; [Spell Resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance): Yes

A missile of magical energy shoots from the caster and unerringly strikes its target, dealing 1d4+1 points of [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage).
The missile strikes unerringly, even if the target is in melee or has anything less than total [cover](modern-d20-srd-combat-cover) or [concealment](modern-d20-srd-combat-concealment). Specific parts of a creature cant be singled out. In­an­imate objects are not damaged by the spell.

For every two levels of experience past 1st, the caster gains an additional missile. He or she has two at 3rd level, three at 5th level, four at 7th level, and the maximum of five missiles at 9th level. If the caster shoots multiple missiles, they can be targeted at a single creature or several creatures. A single missile can strike only one creature. The caster must designate targets before rolling for [spell resistance](modern-d20-srd-special-abilities-spell-resistance) or roll [damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-damage).
