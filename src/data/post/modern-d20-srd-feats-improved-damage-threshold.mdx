## Improved Damage Threshold

Benefit: The character increases his or her [massive damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-death-dying-healing) threshold by 3 points.

Normal: A character without this feat has a [massive damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-death-dying-healing) threshold equal to his or her current
[Constitution](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) score. With this feat,
the character’s [massive damage](modern-d20-srd-combat-death-dying-healing)
threshold is current [Con](modern-d20-srd-basics-ability-scores) +3.

Special: A character may gain this feat multiple times. Its effects stack.
