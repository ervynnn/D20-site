## Space Creature (Template)


A space creature is a xenomorph that either lives in the cold vacuum of space or can survive there indefinitely. Space creatures often hibernate in comets and asteroids. Others wander outer space in search of food, occasionally taking up residence on planets where food is abundant (assuming they can find a safe way to the surface). Space creatures even threaten astronauts and idle starships from time to time. Not all space creatures are motivated by hunger or sheer malice; other likely motives include natural curiosity or a desire for companionship. Space is, after all, a vast and lonely place.
