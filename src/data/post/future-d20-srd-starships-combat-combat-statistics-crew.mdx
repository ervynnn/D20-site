## Crew


The quality of the crew determines how well a starship performs in and out of combat. Unless otherwise noted, every starship has a trained crew of nonheroic characters. However, situations could arise where a starship must rely on an untrained crew. Conversely, expert crews and ace crews are also availablefor the right price. Table: Crew Quality compares four different qualities of crew: untrained, trained, expert, and ace.


Skill Check Modifier: Apply this modifier to all skill checks made by crew.


Pilot's Dexterity Modifier: A pilot's Dexterity modifier applies to the starship's initiative rolls and the starship's Defense.


Pilot's Class Bonus to Defense: A pilot's class bonus to Defense applies to the starship's Defense and to opposed grapple checks.


Gunner's Attack Bonus: A gunner's attack bonus applies to all ranged attacks made by the ship.


Modifier to Starship's Base Purchase DC: The amount by which the crew increases the base purchase DC of the ship. (This modifier is already factored in to the base purchase DCs of the ships presented below.)


| Table: Crew Quality |  |  |  |  |  |
| :--------------------- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | --: |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Untrained | +0 | +1 | +0 | '4 | '4 |
| Trained | +4 | +3 | +2 | +2 | 0 |
| Expert | +8 | +5 | +4 | +4 | +4 |
| Ace | +12 | +7 | +6 | +8/+3 | +8 |
| 1This includes Pilot checks. |  |  |  |  |  |



### Crew Improvement


To improve in quality, a starship's crew of nonheroic characters must put in the hours and gain combat experience. Table: Crew Improvement shows the length of the crew's tour of duty and the number of ship-to-ship battles the crew must survive to be considered of a particular quality. A crew cannot be elevated to a higher quality until it meets the minimum required time spent serving aboard the ship and the minimum amount of ship-to-ship combat experience.


| Table: Crew Improvement |  |  |
| :------------------------- | :--: | --: |
|  |  |  |
| Untrained | 0'5 months | 0 |
| Trained | 6'11 months | 0'3 |
| Expert | 12'35 months | 4'11 |
| Ace | 3 years or more | 12+ |
