##  Eschew Materials [Metamagic]

You can cast spells without relying on material components.

**Benefit:** An eschewed spell can be cast with no material components. Spells
without material components or whose material components have a Purchase DC of
4 or greater are not affected by this feat.

An eschewed spell uses up a spell slot of the spellâ€™s normal level, modified
by any other metamagic feats.
