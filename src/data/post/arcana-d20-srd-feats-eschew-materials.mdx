     Eschew Materials [Metamagic]




     You can cast spells without relying on material components.





      Benefit:

     An eschewed spell can be cast with no material components. Spells without material components or whose material components have a Purchase DC of 4 or greater are not affected by this feat.




     An eschewed spell uses up a spell slot of the spells normal level, modified by any other metamagic feats.
