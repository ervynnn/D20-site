## Class V Sensor System (PL 6)


This sensor system includes hi-res video sensors with darkvision (out to 60 feet), hi-fidelity audio sensors, a chemical vapor scanner, pressure sensors, and either a ladar or sonar system. Ladar uses laser detectors and ranging sensors to rapidly play low-powered laser beams across the robot's surroundings, allowing it to locate targets. Sonar sensors are used mostly in subaquatic environments, but the technology works almost as well in the air. By bouncing sound waves off objects and measuring the length of time it takes to receive an echo, sonar can produce a clear image of the robot's surroundings.


Ladar Version: A robot with a ladar-equipped Class V sensor system gains a +4 equipment bonus on Spot checks and a +2 equipment bonus on Listen checks. All other skill checks are made without penalty.


Sonar Version: A robot with a sonar-equipped Class V sensor system gains a +4 equipment bonus on Listen checks and a +2 equipment bonus on Spot checks. All other skill checks are made without penalty.


Type: Audio, Olfactory, Tactile, Visual.
