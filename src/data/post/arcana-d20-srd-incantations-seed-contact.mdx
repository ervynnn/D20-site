     Seed: Contact




     Divination




     Knowledge (arcane lore) DC: 30; Range: See text; Targets: One other creature; Duration: Hours; Saving Throw: None; Spell Resistance: No




     You forge a telepathic bond with a particular creature with whom you are familiar (or can currently see directly or through magical means) and can converse back and forth. The subject recognizes you if it knows you. It can answer in like manner immediately, though it does not have to.




     You can forge a communal bond among more than two creatures. For each additional creature contacted, increase the Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by +1. The bond can be established only among willing subjects. For telepathic communication through the bond regardless of language, increase the Knowledge (arcane lore) check DC by +4. No special influence is established as a result of the bond, only the power to communicate at a distance.
