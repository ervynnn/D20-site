## 
     Drivesat Comm Array (PL 7)
    



     This massive comm array provides rapid interstellar communications. The array consists of a constellation of dozens of small transmitters that transmit and receive messages through space at faster-thanlight speeds, enabling communications with a range of 50 light-years.
    



     The signals travel at a rate of 5 light-years per hour. Because of the need for steady signal, the ship must remain stationary to transmit and receive messages. If the ship moves while its drivesat array is transmitting or receiving, the ship's communication officer must make a Computer Use check (DC 30) to avoid losing the signal.
    



     Only mediumweight, heavy, and superheavy ships can be equipped with a drivesat comm array.
    



     Purchase DC: 53.
