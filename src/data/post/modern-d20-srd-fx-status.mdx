Status allows a divine caster to mentally monitor the relative positions and
general condition of his or her companions. The caster is aware of direction
and distance to the creatures and their status: unharmed, wounded, disabled,
staggered, unconscious, dying, dead, and so forth. Once the spell has been
cast upon the subjects, the distance between them and the caster does not
affect the spell.
